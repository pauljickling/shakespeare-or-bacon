[what, is, truth, said, jesting, pilate, [42], and, would, not, stay, for, an, answer, certainly, there, be, that, delight, in, giddiness, and, count, it, a, bondage, to, fix, a, belief, affecting, freewill, in, thinking, as, well, as, in, acting, and, though, the, sects, of, philosophers, of, that, kind, be, gone, yet, there, remain, certain, discoursing, wits, which, are, of, the, same, veins, though, there, be, not, so, much, blood, in, them, as, was, in, those, of, the, ancients, but, it, is, not, only, the, difficulty, and, labor, which, men, take, in, finding, out, of, truth, nor, again, that, when, it, is, found, it, imposeth, upon, men’s, thoughts, that, doth, bring, lies, in, favor, but, a, natural, though, corrupt, love, of, the, lie, itself, one, of, the, later, schools[43], of, the, grecians, examineth, the, matter, and, is, at, a, stand, to, think, what, should, be, in, it, that, men, should, love, lies, where, neither, they, make, for, pleasure, as, with, poets, nor, for, advantage, as, with, the, merchant, but, for, the, lie’s, sake, but, cannot, tell, this, same, truth, is, a, naked, and, open, daylight, that, doth, not, show, the, masks, and, mummeries, and, triumphs, of, the, world, half, so, stately, and, daintily, as, candle-lights, truth, may, perhaps, come, to, the, price, of, a, pearl, that, showeth, best, by, day, but, it, will, not, rise, to, the, price, of, a, diamond, or, carbuncle, that, showeth, best, in, varied, lights, mixture, of, a, lie, doth, ever, add, pleasure, doth, any, man, doubt, that, if, there, were, taken, out, of, men’s, minds, vain, opinions, flattering, hopes, false, valuations, imaginations, as, one, would, and, the, like, but, it, would, leave, the, minds, of, a, number, of, men, poor, shrunken, things, full, of, melancholy, and, indisposition, and, unpleasing, to, themselves, one, of, the, fathers, [44], in, great, severity, called, poesy, “vinum, dæmonum, ”[45], because, it, filleth, the, imagination, and, yet, it, is, but, with, the, shadow, of, a, lie, but, it, is, not, the, lie, that, passeth, through, the, mind, but, the, lie, that, sinketh, in, and, settleth, in, it, that, doth, the, hurt, such, as, we, spake, of, before, but, howsoever, these, things, are, thus, in, men’s, depraved, judgments, and, affections, yet, truth, which, only, doth, judge, itself, teacheth, that, the, inquiry, of, truth, which, is, the, love-making, or, wooing, of, it, the, knowledge, of, truth, which, is, the, presence, of, it, and, the, belief, of, truth, which, is, the, enjoying, of, it, is, the, sovereign, good, of, human, nature, the, first, creature, of, god, in, the, works, of, the, days, was, the, light, of, the, sense, [46], the, last, was, the, light, of, reason, [47], and, his, sabbath, work, ever, since, is, the, illumination, of, his, spirit, first, he, breathed, light, upon, the, face, of, the, matter, or, chaos, then, he, breathed, light, into, the, face, of, man, and, still, he, breatheth, and, inspireth, light, into, the, face, of, his, chosen, the, poet[48], that, beautified, the, sect, [49], that, was, otherwise, inferior, to, the, rest, saith, yet, excellently, well, “it, is, a, pleasure, to, stand, upon, the, shore, and, to, see, ships, tossed, upon, the, sea, a, pleasure, to, stand, in, the, window, of, a, castle, and, to, see, a, battle, and, the, adventures, thereof, below, but, no, pleasure, is, comparable, to, the, standing, upon, the, vantage-ground, of, truth”, (a, hill, not, to, be, commanded, and, where, the, air, is, always, clear, and, serene), “and, to, see, the, errors, and, wanderings, and, mists, and, tempests, in, the, vale, below, ”[50], so, always, that, this, prospect, be, with, pity, and, not, with, swelling, or, pride, certainly, it, is, heaven, upon, earth, to, have, a, man’s, mind, move, in, charity, rest, in, providence, and, turn, upon, the, poles, of, truth, to, pass, from, theological, and, philosophical, truth, to, the, truth, of, civil, business, it, will, be, acknowledged, even, by, those, that, practise, it, not, that, clear, and, round, dealing, is, the, honor, of, man’s, nature, and, that, mixture, of, falsehood, is, like, alloy, in, coin, of, gold, and, silver, which, may, make, the, metal, work, the, better, but, it, embaseth, it, for, these, winding, and, crooked, courses, are, the, goings, of, the, serpent, which, goeth, basely, upon, the, belly, and, not, upon, the, feet, there, is, no, vice, that, doth, so, cover, a, man, with, shame, as, to, be, found, false, and, perfidious, and, therefore, montaigne[51], saith, prettily, when, he, inquired, the, reason, why, the, word, of, the, lie, should, be, such, a, disgrace, and, such, an, odious, charge, saith, he, “if, it, be, well, weighed, to, say, that, a, man, lieth, is, as, much, as, to, say, that, he, is, brave, towards, god, and, a, coward, towards, men, for, a, lie, faces, god, and, shrinks, from, man, ”, surely, the, wickedness, of, falsehood, and, breach, of, faith, cannot, possibly, be, so, highly, expressed, as, in, that, it, shall, be, the, last, peal, to, call, the, judgments, of, god, upon, the, generations, of, men, it, being, foretold, that, when, “christ, cometh, ”, he, shall, not, “find, faith, upon, the, earth, ”[52], [53], men, fear, death, as, children, fear, to, go, in, the, dark, and, as, that, natural, fear, in, children, is, increased, with, tales, so, is, the, other, certainly, the, contemplation, of, death, as, the, wages, of, sin, and, passage, to, another, world, is, holy, and, religious, but, the, fear, of, it, as, a, tribute, due, unto, nature, is, weak, yet, in, religious, meditations, there, is, sometimes, mixture, of, vanity, and, of, superstition, you, shall, read, in, some, of, the, friars’, books, of, mortification, that, a, man, should, think, with, himself, what, the, pain, is, if, he, have, but, his, finger’s, end, pressed, or, tortured, and, thereby, imagine, what, the, pains, of, death, are, when, the, whole, body, is, corrupted, and, dissolved, when, many, times, death, passeth, with, less, pain, than, the, torture, of, a, limb, for, the, most, vital, parts, are, not, the, quickest, of, sense, and, by, him, that, spake, only, as, a, philosopher, and, natural, man, it, was, well, said, “pompa, mortis, magis, terret, quam, mors, ipsa, ”[54], groans, and, convulsions, and, a, discolored, face, and, friends, weeping, and, blacks[55], and, obsequies, and, the, like, show, death, terrible, it, is, worthy, the, observing, that, there, is, no, passion, in, the, mind, of, man, so, weak, but, it, mates, and, masters, the, fear, of, death, and, therefore, death, is, no, such, terrible, enemy, when, a, man, hath, so, many, attendants, about, him, that, can, win, the, combat, of, him, revenge, triumphs, over, death, love, slights, it, honor, aspireth, to, it, grief, flieth, to, it, fear, preoccupateth, it, nay, we, read, after, otho, the, emperor, had, slain, himself, pity, (which, is, the, tenderest, of, affections), provoked, many, to, die, out, of, mere, compassion, to, their, sovereign, and, as, the, truest, sort, of, followers, [56], nay, seneca[57], adds, niceness, and, satiety, “cogita, quamdiu, eadem, feceris, mori, velle, non, tantum, fortis, aut, miser, sed, etiam, fastidiosus, potest, ”[58], man, would, die, though, he, were, neither, valiant, nor, miserable, only, upon, a, weariness, to, do, the, same, thing, so, oft, over, and, over, it, is, no, less, worthy, to, observe, how, little, alteration, in, good, spirits, the, approaches, of, death, make, for, they, appear, to, be, the, same, men, till, the, last, instant, augustus, cæsar, died, in, a, compliment, “livia, conjugii, nostri, memor, vive, et, vale, ”[59], tiberius, in, dissimulation, as, tacitus, saith, of, him, “jam, tiberium, vires, et, corpus, non, dissimulatio, deserebant, ”[60], vespasian, in, a, jest, sitting, upon, the, stool, [61], “ut, puto, deus, fio, ”[62], galba, with, a, sentence, “feri, si, ex, re, sit, populi, romani, ”[63], holding, forth, his, neck, septimus, severus, in, dispatch, “adeste, si, quid, mihi, restat, agendum, ”[64], and, the, like, certainly, the, stoics[65], bestowed, too, much, cost, upon, death, and, by, their, great, preparations, made, it, appear, more, fearful, better, saith, he, “qui, finem, vitæ, extremum, inter, munera, ponit, naturæ, ”[66], it, is, as, natural, to, die, as, to, be, born, and, to, a, little, infant, perhaps, the, one, is, as, painful, as, the, other, he, that, dies, in, an, earnest, pursuit, is, like, one, that, is, wounded, in, hot, blood, who, for, the, time, scarce, feels, the, hurt, and, therefore, a, mind, fixed, and, bent, upon, somewhat, that, is, good, doth, avert, the, dolors, of, death, but, above, all, believe, it, the, sweetest, canticle, is, “nunc, dimittis, ”[67], when, a, man, hath, obtained, worthy, ends, and, expectations, death, hath, this, also, that, it, openeth, the, gate, to, good, fame, and, extinguisheth, envy, “extinctus, amabitur, idem, ”[68], religion, being, the, chief, band, of, human, society, it, is, a, happy, thing, when, itself, is, well, contained, within, the, true, band, of, unity, the, quarrels, and, divisions, about, religion, were, evils, unknown, to, the, heathen, the, reason, was, because, the, religion, of, the, heathen, consisted, rather, in, rites, and, ceremonies, than, in, any, constant, belief, for, you, may, imagine, what, kind, of, faith, theirs, was, when, the, chief, doctors, and, fathers, of, their, church, were, the, poets, but, the, true, god, hath, this, attribute, that, he, is, a, jealous, god, and, therefore, his, worship, and, religion, will, endure, no, mixture, nor, partner, we, shall, therefore, speak, a, few, words, concerning, the, unity, of, the, church, what, are, the, fruits, thereof, what, the, bounds, and, what, the, means, the, fruits, of, unity, (next, unto, the, well-pleasing, of, god, which, is, all, in, all), are, two, the, one, towards, those, that, are, without, the, church, the, other, towards, those, that, are, within, for, the, former, it, is, certain, that, heresies, and, schisms, are, of, all, others, the, greatest, scandals, yea, more, than, corruption, of, manners, for, as, in, the, natural, body, a, wound, or, solution, of, continuity, is, worse, than, a, corrupt, humor, so, in, the, spiritual, so, that, nothing, doth, so, much, keep, men, out, of, the, church, and, drive, men, out, of, the, church, as, breach, of, unity, and, therefore, whensoever, it, cometh, to, that, pass, that, one, saith, “ecce, in, deserto, ”[69], another, saith, “ecce, in, penetralibus, ”[70], that, is, when, some, men, seek, christ, in, the, conventicles, of, heretics, and, others, in, an, outward, face, of, a, church, that, voice, had, need, continually, to, sound, in, men’s, ears, “nolite, exire, ”, “go, not, out, ”, the, doctor, of, the, gentiles, (the, propriety, of, whose, vocation, drew, him, to, have, a, special, care, of, those, without), saith, “if, a, heathen[71], come, in, and, hear, you, speak, with, several, tongues, will, he, not, say, that, you, are, mad, ”, and, certainly, it, is, little, better, when, atheists, and, profane, persons, do, hear, of, so, many, discordant, and, contrary, opinions, in, religion, it, doth, avert, them, from, the, church, and, maketh, them, “to, sit, down, in, the, chair, of, the, scorners, ”[72], it, is, but, a, light, thing, to, be, vouched, in, so, serious, a, matter, but, yet, it, expresseth, well, the, deformity, there, is, a, master, of, scoffing, that, in, his, catalogue, of, books, of, a, feigned, library, sets, down, this, title, of, a, book, “the, morris-dance[73], of, heretics, ”, for, indeed, every, sect, of, them, hath, a, diverse, posture, or, cringe, by, themselves, which, cannot, but, move, derision, in, worldlings, and, depraved, politicians, who, are, apt, to, contemn, holy, things, as, for, the, fruit, towards, those, that, are, within, it, is, peace, which, containeth, infinite, blessings, it, establisheth, faith, it, kindleth, charity, the, outward, peace, of, the, church, distilleth, into, peace, of, conscience, and, it, turneth, the, labors, of, writing, and, reading, of, controversies, into, treatises, of, mortification, and, devotion, concerning, the, bounds, of, unity, the, true, placing, of, them, importeth, exceedingly, there, appear, to, be, two, extremes, for, to, certain, zealots, all, speech, of, pacification, is, odious, “is, it, peace, jehu, ”—“what, hast, thou, to, do, with, peace, turn, thee, behind, me, ”[74], peace, is, not, the, matter, but, following, and, party, contrariwise, certain, laodiceans[75], and, lukewarm, persons, think, they, may, accommodate, points, of, religion, by, middle, ways, and, taking, part, of, both, and, witty, reconcilements, as, if, they, would, make, an, arbitrament, between, god, and, man, both, these, extremes, are, to, be, avoided, which, will, be, done, if, the, league, of, christians, penned, by, our, saviour, himself, were, in, the, two, cross, clauses, thereof, soundly, and, plainly, expounded, “he, that, is, not, with, us, is, against, us, ”[76], and, again, “he, that, is, not, against, us, is, with, us, ”, that, is, if, the, points, fundamental, and, of, substance, in, religion, were, truly, discerned, and, distinguished, from, points, not, merely, of, faith, but, of, opinion, order, or, good, intention, this, is, a, thing, may, seem, to, many, a, matter, trivial, and, done, already, but, if, it, were, done, less, partially, it, would, be, embraced, more, generally, of, this, may, give, only, this, advice, according, to, my, small, model, men, ought, to, take, heed, of, rending, god’s, church, by, two, kinds, of, controversies, the, one, is, when, the, matter, of, the, point, controverted, is, too, small, and, light, not, worth, the, heat, and, strife, about, it, kindled, only, by, contradiction, for, as, it, is, noted, by, one, of, the, fathers, “christ’s, coat, indeed, had, no, seam, but, the, church’s, vesture, was, of, divers, colors, ”, whereupon, he, saith, “in, veste, varietas, sit, scissura, non, sit, ”[77], they, be, two, things, unity, and, uniformity, the, other, is, when, the, matter, of, the, point, controverted, is, great, but, it, is, driven, to, an, over-great, subtilty, and, obscurity, so, that, it, becometh, a, thing, rather, ingenious, than, substantial, man, that, is, of, judgment, and, understanding, shall, sometimes, hear, ignorant, men, differ, and, know, well, within, himself, that, those, which, so, differ, mean, one, thing, and, yet, they, themselves, would, never, agree, and, if, it, come, so, to, pass, in, that, distance, of, judgment, which, is, between, man, and, man, shall, we, not, think, that, god, above, that, knows, the, heart, doth, not, discern, that, frail, men, in, some, of, their, contradictions, intend, the, same, thing, and, accepteth, of, both, the, nature, of, such, controversies, is, excellently, expressed, by, st, paul, in, the, warning, and, precept, that, he, giveth, concerning, the, same, “devita, profanas, vocum, novitates, et, oppositiones, falsi, nominis, scientiæ, ”[78], men, create, oppositions, which, are, not, and, put, them, into, new, terms, so, fixed, as, whereas, the, meaning, ought, to, govern, the, term, the, term, in, effect, governeth, the, meaning, there, be, also, two, false, peaces, or, unities, the, one, when, the, peace, is, grounded, but, upon, an, implicit, ignorance, for, all, colors, will, agree, in, the, dark, the, other, when, it, is, pieced, up, upon, a, direct, admission, of, contraries, in, fundamental, points, for, truth, and, falsehood, in, such, things, are, like, the, iron, and, clay, in, the, toes, of, nebuchadnezzar’s, image, [79], they, may, cleave, but, they, will, not, incorporate, concerning, the, means, of, procuring, unity, men, must, beware, that, in, the, procuring, or, muniting, of, religious, unity, they, do, not, dissolve, and, deface, the, laws, of, charity, and, of, human, society, there, be, two, swords, amongst, christians, the, spiritual, and, temporal, and, both, have, their, due, office, and, place, in, the, maintenance, of, religion, but, we, may, not, take, up, the, third, sword, which, is, mahomet’s, sword, [80], or, like, unto, it, that, is, to, propagate, religion, by, wars, or, by, sanguinary, persecutions, to, force, consciences, except, it, be, in, cases, of, overt, scandal, blasphemy, or, intermixture, of, practice, against, the, state, much, less, to, nourish, seditions, to, authorize, conspiracies, and, rebellions, to, put, the, sword, into, the, people’s, hands, and, the, like, tending, to, the, subversion, of, all, government, which, is, the, ordinance, of, god, for, this, is, but, to, dash, the, first, table, against, the, second, and, so, to, consider, men, as, christians, as, we, forget, that, they, are, men, lucretius, the, poet, when, he, beheld, the, act, of, agamemnon, that, could, endure, the, sacrificing, of, his, own, daughter, exclaimed, —, “tantum, religio, potuit, suadere, malorum, ”[81], what, would, he, have, said, if, he, had, known, of, the, massacre, in, france, [82], or, the, powder, treason, of, england, [83], he, would, have, been, seven, times, more, epicure, and, atheist, than, he, was, for, as, the, temporal, sword, is, to, be, drawn, with, great, circumspection, in, cases, of, religion, so, it, is, a, thing, monstrous, to, put, it, into, the, hands, of, the, common, people, let, that, be, left, unto, the, anabaptists, and, other, furies, it, was, great, blasphemy, when, the, devil, said, will, ascend, and, be, like, the, highest, ”[84], but, it, is, greater, blasphemy, to, personate, god, and, bring, him, in, saying, will, descend, and, be, like, the, prince, of, darkness, ”, and, what, is, it, better, to, make, the, cause, of, religion, to, descend, to, the, cruel, and, execrable, actions, of, murdering, princes, butchery, of, people, and, subversion, of, states, and, governments, surely, this, is, to, bring, down, the, holy, ghost, instead, of, the, likeness, of, a, dove, in, the, shape, of, a, vulture, or, raven, and, to, set, out, of, the, bark, of, a, christian, church, a, flag, of, a, bark, of, pirates, and, assassins, therefore, it, is, most, necessary, that, the, church, by, doctrine, and, decree, princes, by, their, sword, and, all, learnings, both, christian, and, moral, as, by, their, mercury, rod, [85], do, damn, and, send, to, hell, forever, those, facts, and, opinions, tending, to, the, support, of, the, same, as, hath, been, already, in, good, part, done, surely, in, counsels, concerning, religion, that, counsel, of, the, apostle, would, be, prefixed, “ira, hominis, non, implet, justitiam, dei, ”[86], and, it, was, a, notable, observation, of, a, wise, father, and, no, less, ingenuously, confessed, that, those, which, held, and, persuaded, pressure, of, consciences, were, commonly, interested, therein, themselves, for, their, own, ends, revenge, is, a, kind, of, wild, justice, which, the, more, man’s, nature, runs, to, the, more, ought, law, to, weed, it, out, for, as, for, the, first, wrong, it, doth, but, offend, the, law, but, the, revenge, of, that, wrong, putteth, the, law, out, of, office, certainly, in, taking, revenge, a, man, is, but, even, with, his, enemy, but, in, passing, it, over, he, is, superior, for, it, is, a, prince’s, part, to, pardon, and, solomon, am, sure, saith, “it, is, the, glory, of, a, man, to, pass, by, an, offence, ”, that, which, is, past, is, gone, and, irrevocable, and, wise, men, have, enough, to, do, with, things, present, and, to, come, therefore, they, do, but, trifle, with, themselves, that, labor, in, past, matters, there, is, no, man, doth, a, wrong, for, the, wrong’s, sake, but, thereby, to, purchase, himself, profit, or, pleasure, or, honor, or, the, like, therefore, why, should, be, angry, with, a, man, for, loving, himself, better, than, me, and, if, any, man, should, do, wrong, merely, out, of, ill-nature, why, yet, it, is, but, like, the, thorn, or, briar, which, prick, and, scratch, because, they, can, do, no, other, the, most, tolerable, sort, of, revenge, is, for, those, wrongs, which, there, is, no, law, to, remedy, but, then, let, a, man, take, heed, the, revenge, be, such, as, there, is, no, law, to, punish, else, a, man’s, enemy, is, still, beforehand, and, it, is, two, for, one, some, when, they, take, revenge, are, desirous, the, party, should, know, whence, it, cometh, this, is, the, more, generous, for, the, delight, seemeth, to, be, not, so, much, in, doing, the, hurt, as, in, making, the, party, repent, but, base, and, crafty, cowards, are, like, the, arrow, that, flieth, in, the, dark, cosmus, duke, of, florence, [87], had, a, desperate, saying, against, perfidious, or, neglecting, friends, as, if, those, wrongs, were, unpardonable, “you, shall, read, ”, saith, he, “that, we, are, commanded, to, forgive, our, enemies, but, you, never, read, that, we, are, commanded, to, forgive, our, friends, ”, but, yet, the, spirit, of, job, was, in, a, better, tune, “shall, we, ”, saith, he, “take, good, at, god’s, hands, and, not, be, content, to, take, evil, also, ”[88], and, so, of, friends, in, a, proportion, this, is, certain, that, a, man, that, studieth, revenge, keeps, his, own, wounds, green, which, otherwise, would, heal, and, do, well, public, revenges[89], are, for, the, most, part, fortunate, as, that, for, the, death, of, cæsar, [90], for, the, death, of, pertinax, for, the, death, of, henry, the, third, of, france, [91], and, many, more, but, in, private, revenges, it, is, not, so, nay, rather, vindictive, persons, live, the, life, of, witches, who, as, they, are, mischievous, so, end, they, unfortunate, it, was, a, high, speech, of, seneca, (after, the, manner, of, the, stoics), that, “the, good, things, which, belong, to, prosperity, are, to, be, wished, but, the, good, things, that, belong, to, adversity, are, to, be, admired, ”, (“bona, rerum, secundarum, optabilia, adversarum, mirabilia, ”)[92], certainly, if, miracles, be, the, command, over, nature, they, appear, most, in, adversity, it, is, yet, a, higher, speech, of, his, than, the, other, (much, too, high, for, a, heathen), “it, is, true, greatness, to, have, in, one, the, frailty, of, a, man, and, the, security, of, a, god, ”, (“vere, magnum, habere, fragilitatem, hominis, securitatem, dei, ”)[93], this, would, have, done, better, in, poesy, where, transcendencies, are, more, allowed, and, the, poets, indeed, have, been, busy, with, it, for, it, is, in, effect, the, thing, which, is, figured, in, that, strange, fiction, of, the, ancient, poets, [94], which, seemeth, not, to, be, without, mystery, nay, and, to, have, some, approach, to, the, state, of, a, christian, “that, hercules, when, he, went, to, unbind, prometheus, (by, whom, human, nature, is, represented), sailed, the, length, of, the, great, ocean, in, an, earthen, pot, or, pitcher, ”, lively, describing, christian, resolution, that, saileth, in, the, frail, bark, of, the, flesh, through, the, waves, of, the, world, but, to, speak, in, a, mean, the, virtue, of, prosperity, is, temperance, the, virtue, of, adversity, is, fortitude, which, in, morals, is, the, more, heroical, virtue, prosperity, is, the, blessing, of, the, old, testament, adversity, is, the, blessing, of, the, new, which, carrieth, the, greater, benediction, and, the, clearer, revelation, of, god’s, favor, yet, even, in, the, old, testament, if, you, listen, to, david’s, harp, you, shall, hear, as, many, hearse-like, airs[95], as, carols, and, the, pencil, of, the, holy, ghost, hath, labored, more, in, describing, the, afflictions, of, job, than, the, felicities, of, solomon, prosperity, is, not, without, many, fears, and, distastes, and, adversity, is, not, without, comforts, and, hopes, we, see, in, needleworks, and, embroideries, it, is, more, pleasing, to, have, a, lively, work, upon, a, sad, and, solemn, ground, than, to, have, a, dark, and, melancholy, work, upon, a, lightsome, ground, judge, therefore, of, the, pleasure, of, the, heart, by, the, pleasure, of, the, eye, certainly, virtue, is, like, precious, odors, most, fragrant, when, they, are, incensed, or, crushed, for, prosperity, doth, best, discover, vice, but, adversity, doth, best, discover, virtue, [96], dissimulation, is, but, a, faint, kind, of, policy, or, wisdom, for, it, asketh, a, strong, wit, and, a, strong, heart, to, know, when, to, tell, truth, and, to, do, it, therefore, it, is, the, weaker, sort, of, politicians, that, are, the, great, dissemblers, tacitus, saith, “livia, sorted, well, with, the, arts, of, her, husband, and, dissimulation, of, her, son, [97], attributing, arts, or, policy, to, augustus, and, dissimulation, to, tiberius, ”, and, again, when, mucianus, encourageth, vespasian, to, take, arms, against, vitellius, he, saith, “we, rise, not, against, the, piercing, judgment, of, augustus, nor, the, extreme, caution, or, closeness, of, tiberius, ”[98], these, properties, of, arts, or, policy, and, dissimulation, or, closeness, are, indeed, habits, and, faculties, several, and, to, be, distinguished, for, if, a, man, have, that, penetration, of, judgment, as, he, can, discern, what, things, are, to, be, laid, open, and, what, to, be, secreted, and, what, to, be, showed, at, half-lights, and, to, whom, and, when, (which, indeed, are, arts, of, state, and, arts, of, life, as, tacitus, well, calleth, them), to, him, a, habit, of, dissimulation, is, a, hinderance, and, a, poorness, but, if, a, man, cannot, obtain, to, that, judgment, then, it, is, left, to, him, generally, to, be, close, and, a, dissembler, for, where, a, man, cannot, choose, or, vary, in, particulars, there, it, is, good, to, take, the, safest, and, wariest, way, in, general, like, the, going, softly, by, one, that, cannot, well, see, certainly, the, ablest, men, that, ever, were, have, had, all, an, openness, and, frankness, of, dealing, and, a, name, of, certainty, and, veracity, but, then, they, were, like, horses, well, managed, for, they, could, tell, passing, well, when, to, stop, or, turn, and, at, such, times, when, they, thought, the, case, indeed, required, dissimulation, if, then, they, used, it, it, came, to, pass, that, the, former, opinion, spread, abroad, of, their, good, faith, and, clearness, of, dealing, made, them, almost, invisible, there, be, three, degrees, of, this, hiding, and, veiling, of, a, man’s, self, the, first, closeness, reservation, and, secrecy, when, a, man, leaveth, himself, without, observation, or, without, hold, to, be, taken, what, he, is, the, second, dissimulation, in, the, negative, when, a, man, lets, fall, signs, and, arguments, that, he, is, not, that, he, is, and, the, third, simulation, in, the, affirmative, when, a, man, industriously, and, expressly, feigns, and, pretends, to, be, that, he, is, not, for, the, first, of, these, secrecy, it, is, indeed, the, virtue, of, a, confessor, and, assuredly, the, secret, man, heareth, many, confessions, for, who, will, open, himself, to, a, blab, or, a, babbler, but, if, a, man, be, thought, secret, it, inviteth, discovery, as, the, more, close, air, sucketh, in, the, more, open, and, as, in, confession, the, revealing, is, not, for, worldly, use, but, for, the, ease, of, a, man’s, heart, so, secret, men, come, to, the, knowledge, of, many, things, in, that, kind, while, men, rather, discharge, their, minds, than, impart, their, minds, in, few, words, mysteries, are, due, to, secrecy, besides, (to, say, truth), nakedness, is, uncomely, as, well, in, mind, as, body, and, it, addeth, no, small, reverence, to, men’s, manners, and, actions, if, they, be, not, altogether, open, as, for, talkers, and, futile, persons, they, are, commonly, vain, and, credulous, withal, for, he, that, talketh, what, he, knoweth, will, also, talk, what, he, knoweth, not, therefore, set, it, down, that, a, habit, of, secrecy, is, both, politic, and, moral, and, in, this, part, it, is, good, that, a, man’s, face, give, his, tongue, leave, to, speak, for, the, discovery, of, a, man’s, self, by, the, tracts[99], of, his, countenance, is, a, great, weakness, and, betraying, by, how, much, it, is, many, times, more, marked, and, believed, than, a, man’s, words, for, the, second, which, is, dissimulation, it, followeth, many, times, upon, secrecy, by, a, necessity, so, that, he, that, will, be, secret, must, be, a, dissembler, in, some, degree, for, men, are, too, cunning, to, suffer, a, man, to, keep, an, indifferent, carriage, between, both, and, to, be, secret, without, swaying, the, balance, on, either, side, they, will, so, beset, a, man, with, questions, and, draw, him, on, and, pick, it, out, of, him, that, without, an, absurd, silence, he, must, show, an, inclination, one, way, or, if, he, do, not, they, will, gather, as, much, by, his, silence, as, by, his, speech, as, for, equivocations, or, oraculous, speeches, they, cannot, hold, out, long, so, that, no, man, can, be, secret, except, he, give, himself, a, little, scope, of, dissimulation, which, is, as, it, were, but, the, skirts, or, train, of, secrecy, but, for, the, third, degree, which, is, simulation, and, false, profession, that, hold, more, culpable, and, less, politic, except, it, be, in, great, and, rare, matters, and, therefore, a, general, custom, of, simulation, (which, is, this, last, degree), is, a, vice, rising, either, of, a, natural, falseness, or, fearfulness, or, of, a, mind, that, hath, some, main, faults, which, because, a, man, must, needs, disguise, it, maketh, him, practise, simulation, in, other, things, lest, his, hand, should, be, out, of, use, the, advantages, of, simulation, and, dissimulation, are, three, first, to, lay, asleep, opposition, and, to, surprise, for, where, a, man’s, intentions, are, published, it, is, an, alarum, to, call, up, all, that, are, against, them, the, second, is, to, reserve, to, a, man’s, self, a, fair, retreat, for, if, a, man, engage, himself, by, a, manifest, declaration, he, must, go, through, or, take, a, fall, the, third, is, the, better, to, discover, the, mind, of, another, for, to, him, that, opens, himself, men, will, hardly, show, themselves, adverse, but, will, (fair), let, him, go, on, and, turn, their, freedom, of, speech, to, freedom, of, thought, and, therefore, it, is, a, good, shrewd, proverb, of, the, spaniard, “tell, a, lie, and, find, a, troth, ”[100], as, if, there, were, no, way, of, discovery, but, by, simulation, there, be, also, three, disadvantages, to, set, it, even, the, first, that, simulation, and, dissimulation, commonly, carry, with, them, a, show, of, fearfulness, which, in, any, business, doth, spoil, the, feathers, of, round, flying, up, to, the, mark, the, second, that, it, puzzleth, and, perplexeth, the, conceits, of, many, that, perhaps, would, otherwise, coöperate, with, him, and, makes, a, man, walk, almost, alone, to, his, own, ends, the, third, and, greatest, is, that, it, depriveth, a, man, of, one, of, the, most, principal, instruments, for, action, which, is, trust, and, belief, the, best, composition, and, temperature, is, to, have, openness, in, fame, and, opinion, secrecy, in, habit, dissimulation, in, seasonable, use, and, a, power, to, feign, if, there, be, no, remedy, the, joys, of, parents, are, secret, and, so, are, their, griefs, and, fears, they, cannot, utter, the, one, nor, they, will, not, utter, the, other, children, sweeten, labors, but, they, make, misfortunes, more, bitter, they, increase, the, cares, of, life, but, they, mitigate, the, remembrance, of, death, the, perpetuity, by, generation, is, common, to, beasts, but, memory, merit, and, noble, works, are, proper, to, men, and, surely, a, man, shall, see, the, noblest, works, and, foundations, have, proceeded, from, childless, men, which, have, sought, to, express, the, images, of, their, minds, where, those, of, their, bodies, have, failed, so, the, care, of, posterity, is, most, in, them, that, have, no, posterity, they, that, are, the, first, raisers, of, their, houses, are, most, indulgent, towards, their, children, beholding, them, as, the, continuance, not, only, of, their, kind, but, of, their, work, and, so, both, children, and, creatures, the, difference, in, affection, of, parents, towards, their, several, children, is, many, times, unequal, and, sometimes, unworthy, especially, in, the, mother, as, solomon, saith, wise, son, rejoiceth, the, father, but, an, ungracious, son, shames, the, mother, ”[101], man, shall, see, where, there, is, a, house, full, of, children, one, or, two, of, the, eldest, respected, and, the, youngest, made, wantons, [102], but, in, the, midst, some, that, are, as, it, were, forgotten, who, many, times, nevertheless, prove, the, best, the, illiberality, of, parents, in, allowance, towards, their, children, is, a, harmful, error, makes, them, base, acquaints, them, with, shifts, makes, them, sort, with, mean, company, and, makes, them, surfeit, more, when, they, come, to, plenty, and, therefore, the, proof[103], is, best, when, men, keep, their, authority, towards, their, children, but, not, their, purse, men, have, a, foolish, manner, (both, parents, and, schoolmasters, and, servants), in, creating, and, breeding, an, emulation, between, brothers, during, childhood, which, many, times, sorteth[104], to, discord, when, they, are, men, and, disturbeth, families, [105], the, italians, make, little, difference, between, children, and, nephews, or, near, kinsfolk, but, so, they, be, of, the, lump, they, care, not, though, they, pass, not, through, their, own, body, and, to, say, truth, in, nature, it, is, much, a, like, matter, insomuch, that, we, see, a, nephew, sometimes, resembleth, an, uncle, or, a, kinsman, more, than, his, own, parent, as, the, blood, happens, let, parents, choose, betimes, the, vocations, and, courses, they, mean, their, children, should, take, for, then, they, are, most, flexible, and, let, them, not, too, much, apply, themselves, to, the, disposition, of, their, children, as, thinking, they, will, take, best, to, that, which, they, have, most, mind, to, it, is, true, that, if, the, affection, or, aptness, of, the, children, be, extraordinary, then, it, is, good, not, to, cross, it, but, generally, the, precept, is, good, “optimum, elige, suave, et, facile, illud, faciet, consuetudo, ”[106]—younger, brothers, are, commonly, fortunate, but, seldom, or, never, where, the, elder, are, disinherited, he, that, hath, wife, and, children, hath, given, hostages, to, fortune, for, they, are, impediments, to, great, enterprises, either, of, virtue, or, mischief, certainly, the, best, works, and, of, greatest, merit, for, the, public, have, proceeded, from, the, unmarried, or, childless, men, which, both, in, affection, and, means, have, married, and, endowed, the, public, yet, it, were, great, reason, that, those, that, have, children, should, have, greatest, care, of, future, times, unto, which, they, know, they, must, transmit, their, dearest, pledges, some, there, are, who, though, they, lead, a, single, life, yet, their, thoughts, do, end, with, themselves, and, account, future, times, impertinences, nay, there, are, some, other, that, account, wife, and, children, but, as, bills, of, charges, nay, more, there, are, some, foolish, rich, covetous, men, that, take, a, pride, in, having, no, children, because, they, may, be, thought, so, much, the, richer, for, perhaps, they, have, heard, some, talk, “such, an, one, is, a, great, rich, man, ”, and, another, except, to, it, “yea, but, he, hath, a, great, charge, of, children, ”, as, if, it, were, an, abatement, to, his, riches, but, the, most, ordinary, cause, of, a, single, life, is, liberty, especially, in, certain, self-pleasing, and, humorous, minds, which, are, so, sensible, of, every, restraint, as, they, will, go, near, to, think, their, girdles, and, garters, to, be, bonds, and, shackles, unmarried, men, are, best, friends, best, masters, best, servants, but, not, always, best, subjects, for, they, are, light, to, run, away, and, almost, all, fugitives, are, of, that, condition, single, life, doth, well, with, churchmen, for, charity, will, hardly, water, the, ground, where, it, must, first, fill, a, pool, [107], it, is, indifferent, for, judges, and, magistrates, for, if, they, be, facile, and, corrupt, you, shall, have, a, servant, five, times, worse, than, a, wife, for, soldiers, find, the, generals, commonly, in, their, hortatives, put, men, in, mind, of, their, wives, and, children, and, think, the, despising, of, marriage, amongst, the, turks, maketh, the, vulgar, soldier, more, base, certainly, wife, and, children, are, a, kind, of, discipline, of, humanity, and, single, men, though, they, be, many, times, more, charitable, because, their, means, are, less, exhaust, yet, on, the, other, side, they, are, more, cruel, and, hard-hearted, (good, to, make, severe, inquisitors), because, their, tenderness, is, not, so, oft, called, upon, grave, natures, led, by, custom, and, therefore, constant, are, commonly, loving, husbands, as, was, said, of, ulysses, “vetulam, suam, praetulit, immortalitati, ”[108], chaste, women, are, often, proud, and, froward, as, presuming, upon, the, merit, of, their, chastity, it, is, one, of, the, best, bonds, both, of, chastity, and, obedience, in, the, wife, if, she, think, her, husband, wise, which, she, will, never, do, if, she, find, him, jealous, wives, are, young, men’s, mistresses, companions, for, middle, age, and, old, men’s, nurses, so, as, a, man, may, have, a, quarrel[109], to, marry, when, he, will, but, yet, he, was, reputed, one, of, the, wise, men, that, made, answer, to, the, question, when, a, man, should, marry, young, man, not, yet, an, elder, man, not, at, all, ”[110], it, is, often, seen, that, bad, husbands, have, very, good, wives, whether, it, be, that, it, raiseth, the, price, of, their, husbands’, kindness, when, it, comes, or, that, the, wives, take, a, pride, in, their, patience, but, this, never, fails, if, the, bad, husbands, were, of, their, own, choosing, against, their, friends’, consent, for, then, they, will, be, sure, to, make, good, their, own, folly, there, be, none, of, the, affections, which, have, been, noted, to, fascinate, or, bewitch, but, love, and, envy, they, both, have, vehement, wishes, they, frame, themselves, readily, into, imaginations, and, suggestions, and, they, come, easily, into, the, eye, especially, upon, the, presence, of, the, objects, which, are, the, points, that, conduce, to, fascination, if, any, such, thing, there, be, we, see, likewise, the, scripture, calleth, envy, an, evil, eye, [111], and, the, astrologers, call, the, evil, influences, of, the, stars, evil, aspects, so, that, still, there, seemeth, to, be, acknowledged, in, the, act, of, envy, an, ejaculation, or, irradiation, of, the, eye, nay, some, have, been, so, curious, as, to, note, that, the, times, when, the, stroke, or, percussion, of, an, envious, eye, doth, most, hurt, are, when, the, party, envied, is, beheld, in, glory, or, triumph, for, that, sets, an, edge, upon, envy, and, besides, at, such, times, the, spirits, of, the, person, envied, do, come, forth, most, into, the, outward, parts, and, so, meet, the, blow, but, leaving, these, curiosities, (though, not, unworthy, to, be, thought, on, in, fit, place), we, will, handle, what, persons, are, apt, to, envy, others, what, persons, are, most, subject, to, be, envied, themselves, and, what, is, the, difference, between, public, and, private, envy, man, that, hath, no, virtue, in, himself, ever, envieth, virtue, in, others, for, men’s, minds, will, either, feed, upon, their, own, good, or, upon, others’, evil, and, who, wanteth, the, one, will, prey, upon, the, other, and, whoso, is, out, of, hope, to, attain, to, another’s, virtue, will, seek, to, come, at, even, hand[112], by, depressing, another’s, fortune, man, that, is, busy, and, inquisitive, is, commonly, envious, for, to, know, much, of, other, men’s, matters, cannot, be, because, all, that, ado, may, concern, his, own, estate, therefore, it, must, needs, be, that, he, taketh, a, kind, of, play-pleasure, in, looking, upon, the, fortunes, of, others, neither, can, he, that, mindeth, but, his, own, business, find, much, matter, for, envy, for, envy, is, a, gadding, passion, and, walketh, the, streets, and, doth, not, keep, home, “non, est, curiosus, quin, idem, sit, malevolus, ”[113], men, of, noble, birth, are, noted, to, be, envious, towards, new, men, when, they, rise, for, the, distance, is, altered, and, it, is, like, a, deceit, of, the, eye, that, when, others, come, on, they, think, themselves, go, back, deformed, persons, and, eunuchs, and, old, men, and, bastards, are, envious, for, he, that, cannot, possibly, mend, his, own, case, will, do, what, he, can, to, impair, another’s, except, these, defects, light, upon, a, very, brave, and, heroical, nature, which, thinketh, to, make, his, natural, wants, part, of, his, honor, in, that, it, should, be, said, “that, a, eunuch, or, a, lame, man, did, such, great, matters, ”, affecting, the, honor, of, a, miracle, as, it, was, in, narses[114], the, eunuch, and, agesilaus, and, tamerlane, [115], that, were, lame, men, the, same, is, the, case, of, men, that, rise, after, calamities, and, misfortunes, for, they, are, as, men, fallen, out, with, the, times, and, think, other, men’s, harms, a, redemption, of, their, own, sufferings, they, that, desire, to, excel, in, too, many, matters, out, of, levity, and, vainglory, are, ever, envious, for, they, cannot, want, work, it, being, impossible, but, many, in, some, one, of, those, things, should, surpass, them, which, was, the, character, of, adrian, the, emperor, that, mortally, envied, poets, and, painters, and, artificers, in, works, wherein, he, had, a, vein, to, excel, [116], lastly, near, kinsfolk, and, fellows, in, office, and, those, that, have, been, bred, together, are, more, apt, to, envy, their, equals, when, they, are, raised, for, it, doth, upbraid, unto, them, their, own, fortunes, and, pointeth, at, them, and, cometh, oftener, into, their, remembrance, and, incurreth, likewise, more, into, the, note[117], of, others, and, envy, ever, redoubleth, from, speech, and, fame, cain’s, envy, was, the, more, vile, and, malignant, towards, his, brother, abel, because, when, his, sacrifice, was, better, accepted, there, was, nobody, to, look, on, thus, much, for, those, that, are, apt, to, envy, concerning, those, that, are, more, or, less, subject, to, envy, first, persons, of, eminent, virtue, when, they, are, advanced, are, less, envied, for, their, fortune, seemeth, but, due, unto, them, and, no, man, envieth, the, payment, of, a, debt, but, rewards, and, liberality, rather, again, envy, is, ever, joined, with, the, comparing, of, a, man’s, self, and, where, there, is, no, comparison, no, envy, and, therefore, kings, are, not, envied, but, by, kings, nevertheless, it, is, to, be, noted, that, unworthy, persons, are, most, envied, at, their, first, coming, in, and, afterwards, overcome, it, better, whereas, contrariwise, persons, of, worth, and, merit, are, most, envied, when, their, fortune, continueth, long, for, by, that, time, though, their, virtue, be, the, same, yet, it, hath, not, the, same, lustre, for, fresh, men, grow, up, that, darken, it, persons, of, noble, blood, are, less, envied, in, their, rising, for, it, seemeth, but, right, done, to, their, birth, besides, there, seemeth, not, so, much, added, to, their, fortune, and, envy, is, as, the, sunbeams, that, beat, hotter, upon, a, bank, or, steep, rising, ground, than, upon, a, flat, and, for, the, same, reason, those, that, are, advanced, by, degrees, are, less, envied, than, those, that, are, advanced, suddenly, and, _per, saltum_, [118], those, that, have, joined, with, their, honor, great, travels, cares, or, perils, are, less, subject, to, envy, for, men, think, that, they, earn, their, honors, hardly, and, pity, them, sometimes, and, pity, ever, healeth, envy, wherefore, you, shall, observe, that, the, more, deep, and, sober, sort, of, politic, persons, in, their, greatness, are, ever, bemoaning, themselves, what, a, life, they, lead, chanting, a, _quanta, patimur_, [119], not, that, they, feel, it, so, but, only, to, abate, the, edge, of, envy, but, this, is, to, be, understood, of, business, that, is, laid, upon, men, and, not, such, as, they, call, unto, themselves, for, nothing, increaseth, envy, more, than, an, unnecessary, and, ambitious, engrossing, of, business, and, nothing, doth, extinguish, envy, more, than, for, a, great, person, to, preserve, all, other, inferior, officers, in, their, full, rights, and, preëminences, of, their, places, for, by, that, means, there, be, so, many, screens, between, him, and, envy, above, all, those, are, most, subject, to, envy, which, carry, the, greatness, of, their, fortunes, in, an, insolent, and, proud, manner, being, never, well, but, while, they, are, showing, how, great, they, are, either, by, outward, pomp, or, by, triumphing, over, all, opposition, or, competition, whereas, wise, men, will, rather, do, sacrifice, to, envy, in, suffering, themselves, sometimes, of, purpose, to, be, crossed, and, overborne, in, things, that, do, not, much, concern, them, notwithstanding, so, much, is, true, that, the, carriage, of, greatness, in, a, plain, and, open, manner, (so, it, be, without, arrogancy, and, vainglory), doth, draw, less, envy, than, if, it, be, in, a, more, crafty, and, cunning, fashion, for, in, that, course, a, man, doth, but, disavow, fortune, and, seemeth, to, be, conscious, of, his, own, want, in, worth, and, doth, but, teach, others, to, envy, him, lastly, to, conclude, this, part, as, we, said, in, the, beginning, that, the, act, of, envy, had, somewhat, in, it, of, witchcraft, so, there, is, no, other, cure, of, envy, but, the, cure, of, witchcraft, and, that, is, to, remove, the, lot, (as, they, call, it), and, to, lay, it, upon, another, for, which, purpose, the, wiser, sort, of, great, persons, bring, in, ever, upon, the, stage, somebody, upon, whom, to, derive, the, envy, that, would, come, upon, themselves, sometimes, upon, ministers, and, servants, sometimes, upon, colleagues, and, associates, and, the, like, and, for, that, turn, there, are, never, wanting, some, persons, of, violent, and, undertaking, natures, who, so, they, may, have, power, and, business, will, take, it, at, any, cost, now, to, speak, of, public, envy, there, is, yet, some, good, in, public, envy, whereas, in, private, there, is, none, for, public, envy, is, as, an, ostracism, [120], that, eclipseth, men, when, they, grow, too, great, and, therefore, it, is, a, bridle, also, to, great, ones, to, keep, them, within, bounds, this, envy, being, in, the, latin, word, _invidia_, [121], goeth, in, the, modern, languages, by, the, name, of, discontentment, of, which, we, shall, speak, in, handling, sedition, it, is, a, disease, in, a, state, like, to, infection, for, as, infection, spreadeth, upon, that, which, is, sound, and, tainteth, it, so, when, envy, is, gotten, once, into, a, state, it, traduceth, even, the, best, actions, thereof, and, turneth, them, into, an, ill, odor, and, therefore, there, is, little, won, by, intermingling, of, plausible, actions, for, that, doth, argue, but, a, weakness, and, fear, of, envy, which, hurteth, so, much, the, more, as, it, is, likewise, usual, in, infections, which, if, you, fear, them, you, call, them, upon, you, this, public, envy, seemeth, to, beat, chiefly, upon, principal, officers, or, ministers, rather, than, upon, kings, and, estates, themselves, but, this, is, a, sure, rule, that, if, the, envy, upon, the, minister, be, great, when, the, cause, of, it, in, him, is, small, or, if, the, envy, be, general, in, a, manner, upon, all, the, ministers, of, an, estate, then, the, envy, (though, hidden), is, truly, upon, the, state, itself, and, so, much, of, public, envy, or, discontentment, and, the, difference, thereof, from, private, envy, which, was, handled, in, the, first, place, we, will, add, this, in, general, touching, the, affection, of, envy, that, of, all, other, affections, it, is, the, most, importune, and, continual, for, of, other, affections, there, is, occasion, given, but, now, and, then, and, therefore, it, was, well, said, “invidia, festos, dies, non, agit, ”[122], for, it, is, ever, working, upon, some, or, other, and, it, is, also, noted, that, love, and, envy, do, make, a, man, pine, which, other, affections, do, not, because, they, are, not, so, continual, it, is, also, the, vilest, affection, and, the, most, depraved, for, which, cause, it, is, the, proper, attribute, of, the, devil, who, is, called, “the, envious, man, that, soweth, tares, amongst, the, wheat, by, night, ”[123], as, it, always, cometh, to, pass, that, envy, worketh, subtilely, and, in, the, dark, and, to, the, prejudice, of, good, things, such, as, is, the, wheat, the, stage, is, more, beholding[124], to, love, than, the, life, of, man, for, as, to, the, stage, love, is, ever, matter, of, comedies, and, now, and, then, of, tragedies, but, in, life, it, doth, much, mischief, sometimes, like, a, siren, sometimes, like, a, fury, you, may, observe, that, amongst, all, the, great, and, worthy, persons, (whereof, the, memory, remaineth, either, ancient, or, recent), there, is, not, one, that, hath, been, transported, to, the, mad, degree, of, love, which, shows, that, great, spirits, and, great, business, do, keep, out, this, weak, passion, you, must, except, nevertheless, marcus, antonius, the, half, partner, of, the, empire, of, rome, and, appius, claudius, [125], the, decemvir, and, lawgiver, whereof, the, former, was, indeed, a, voluptuous, man, and, inordinate, but, the, latter, was, an, austere, and, wise, man, and, therefore, it, seems, (though, rarely), that, love, can, find, entrance, not, only, into, an, open, heart, but, also, into, a, heart, well, fortified, if, watch, be, not, well, kept, it, is, a, poor, saying, of, epicurus, “satis, magnum, alter, alteri, theatrum, sumus, ”[126], as, if, man, made, for, the, contemplation, of, heaven, and, all, noble, objects, should, do, nothing, but, kneel, before, a, little, idol, and, make, himself, subject, though, not, of, the, mouth, (as, beasts, are), yet, of, the, eye, which, was, given, him, for, higher, purposes, it, is, a, strange, thing, to, note, the, excess, of, this, passion, and, how, it, braves, the, nature, and, value, of, things, by, this, that, the, speaking, in, a, perpetual, hyperbole, is, comely, in, nothing, but, in, love, neither, is, it, merely, in, the, phrase, for, whereas, it, hath, been, well, said, “that, the, arch, flatterer, with, whom, all, the, petty, flatterers, have, intelligence, is, a, man’s, self, ”, certainly, the, lover, is, more, for, there, was, never, proud, man, thought, so, absurdly, well, of, himself, as, the, lover, doth, of, the, person, loved, and, therefore, it, was, well, said, “that, it, is, impossible, to, love, and, to, be, wise, ”[127], neither, doth, this, weakness, appear, to, others, only, and, not, to, the, party, loved, but, to, the, loved, most, of, all, except, the, love, be, reciprocal, for, it, is, a, true, rule, that, love, is, ever, rewarded, either, with, the, reciprocal, or, with, an, inward, and, secret, contempt, by, how, much, the, more, men, ought, to, beware, of, this, passion, which, loseth, not, only, other, things, but, itself, as, for, the, other, losses, the, poet’s, relation[128], doth, well, figure, them, “that, he, that, preferred, helena, quitted, the, gifts, of, juno, and, pallas, ”, for, whosoever, esteemeth, too, much, of, amorous, affection, quitteth, both, riches, and, wisdom, this, passion, hath, his, floods, in, the, very, times, of, weakness, which, are, great, prosperity, and, great, adversity, though, this, latter, hath, been, less, observed, both, which, times, kindle, love, and, make, it, more, fervent, and, therefore, show, it, to, be, the, child, of, folly, they, do, best, who, if, they, cannot, but, admit, love, yet, make, it, keep, quarter, and, sever, it, wholly, from, their, serious, affairs, and, actions, of, life, for, if, it, check, once, with, business, it, troubleth, men’s, fortunes, and, maketh, men, that, they, can, nowise, be, true, to, their, own, ends, know, not, how, but, martial, men, are, given, to, love, think, it, is, but, as, they, are, given, to, wine, for, perils, commonly, ask, to, be, paid, in, pleasures, there, is, in, man’s, nature, a, secret, inclination, and, motion, towards, love, of, others, which, if, it, be, not, spent, upon, some, one, or, a, few, doth, naturally, spread, itself, towards, many, and, maketh, men, become, humane, and, charitable, as, it, is, seen, sometimes, in, friars, nuptial, love, maketh, mankind, friendly, love, perfecteth, it, but, wanton, love, corrupted, and, embaseth, it, [129], men, in, great, place, are, thrice, servants—servants, of, the, sovereign, or, state, servants, of, fame, and, servants, of, business, so, as, they, have, no, freedom, neither, in, their, persons, nor, in, their, actions, nor, in, their, times, it, is, a, strange, desire, to, seek, power, and, to, lose, liberty, or, to, seek, power, over, others, and, to, lose, power, over, a, man’s, self, the, rising, unto, place, is, laborious, and, by, pains, men, come, to, greater, pains, and, it, is, sometimes, base, and, by, indignities, men, come, to, dignities, the, standing, is, slippery, and, the, regress, is, either, a, downfall, or, at, least, an, eclipse, which, is, a, melancholy, thing, “cum, non, sis, qui, fueris, non, esse, cur, velis, vivere, ”[130], nay, retire, men, cannot, when, they, would, neither, will, they, when, it, were, reason, but, are, impatient, of, privateness, even, in, age, and, sickness, which, require, the, shadow, like, old, townsmen, that, will, be, still, sitting, at, their, street, door, though, thereby, they, offer, age, to, scorn, certainly, great, persons, had, need, to, borrow, other, men’s, opinions, to, think, themselves, happy, for, if, they, judge, by, their, own, feeling, they, cannot, find, it, but, if, they, think, with, themselves, what, other, men, think, of, them, and, that, other, men, would, fain, be, as, they, are, then, they, are, happy, as, it, were, by, report, when, perhaps, they, find, the, contrary, within, for, they, are, the, first, that, find, their, own, griefs, though, they, be, the, last, that, find, their, own, faults, certainly, men, in, great, fortunes, are, strangers, to, themselves, and, while, they, are, in, the, puzzle, of, business, they, have, no, time, to, tend, their, health, either, of, body, or, mind, “illi, mors, gravis, incubat, qui, notus, nimis, omnibus, ignotus, moritur, ”[131], in, place, there, is, license, to, do, good, and, evil, whereof, the, latter, is, a, curse, for, in, evil, the, best, condition, is, not, to, will, the, second, not, to, can, but, power, to, do, good, is, the, true, and, lawful, end, of, aspiring, for, good, thoughts, though, god, accept, them, yet, towards, men, are, little, better, than, good, dreams, except, they, be, put, in, act, and, that, cannot, be, without, power, and, place, as, the, vantage, and, commanding, ground, merit, and, good, works, are, the, end, of, man’s, motion, and, conscience, of, the, same, is, the, accomplishment, of, man’s, rest, for, if, a, man, can, be, partaker, of, god’s, theatre, he, shall, likewise, be, partaker, of, god’s, rest, “et, conversus, deus, ut, aspiceret, opera, quæ, fecerunt, manus, suæ, vidit, quod, omnia, essent, bona, nimis, ”[132], and, then, the, sabbath, in, the, discharge, of, thy, place, set, before, thee, the, best, examples, for, imitation, is, a, globe, of, precepts, and, after, a, time, set, before, thee, thine, own, example, and, examine, thyself, strictly, whether, thou, didst, not, best, at, first, neglect, not, also, the, examples, of, those, that, have, carried, themselves, ill, in, the, same, place, not, to, set, off, thyself, by, taxing, their, memory, but, to, direct, thyself, what, to, avoid, reform, therefore, without, bravery, or, scandal, of, former, times, and, persons, but, yet, set, it, down, to, thyself, as, well, to, create, good, precedents, as, to, follow, them, reduce, things, to, the, first, institution, and, observe, wherein, and, how, they, have, degenerated, but, yet, ask, counsel, of, both, times—of, the, ancient, time, what, is, best, and, of, the, latter, time, what, is, fittest, seek, to, make, thy, course, regular, that, men, may, know, beforehand, what, they, may, expect, but, be, not, too, positive, and, peremptory, and, express, thyself, well, when, thou, digressest, from, thy, rule, preserve, the, right, of, thy, place, but, stir, not, questions, of, jurisdiction, and, rather, assume, thy, right, in, silence, and, _de, facto_, [133], than, voice, it, with, claims, and, challenges, preserve, likewise, the, rights, of, inferior, places, and, think, it, more, honor, to, direct, in, chief, than, to, be, busy, in, all, embrace, and, invite, helps, and, advices, touching, the, execution, of, thy, place, and, do, not, drive, away, such, as, bring, thee, information, as, meddlers, but, accept, of, them, in, good, part, the, vices, of, authority, are, chiefly, four, delays, corruption, roughness, and, facility, for, delays, give, easy, access, keep, times, appointed, go, through, with, that, which, is, in, hand, and, interlace, not, business, but, of, necessity, for, corruption, do, not, only, bind, thine, own, hands, or, thy, servant’s, hands, from, taking, but, bind, the, hands, of, suitors, also, from, offering, for, integrity, used, doth, the, one, but, integrity, professed, and, with, a, manifest, detestation, of, bribery, doth, the, other, and, avoid, not, only, the, fault, but, the, suspicion, whosoever, is, found, variable, and, changeth, manifestly, without, manifest, cause, giveth, suspicion, of, corruption, therefore, always, when, thou, changest, thine, opinion, or, course, profess, it, plainly, and, declare, it, together, with, the, reasons, that, move, thee, to, change, and, do, not, think, to, steal, it, servant, or, a, favorite, if, he, be, inward, and, no, other, apparent, cause, of, esteem, is, commonly, thought, but, a, by-way, to, close, corruption, for, roughness, it, is, a, needless, cause, of, discontent, severity, breedeth, fear, but, roughness, breedeth, hate, even, reproofs, from, authority, ought, to, be, grave, and, not, taunting, as, for, facility, [134], it, is, worse, than, bribery, for, bribes, come, but, now, and, then, but, if, importunity, or, idle, respects[135], lead, a, man, he, shall, never, be, without, as, solomon, saith, “to, respect, persons, is, not, good, for, such, a, man, will, transgress, for, a, piece, of, bread, ”[136], it, is, most, true, that, was, anciently, spoken, place, showeth, the, man, and, it, showeth, some, to, the, better, and, some, to, the, worse, ”, “omnium, consensu, capax, imperii, nisi, imperasset, ”[137], saith, tacitus, of, galba, but, of, vespasian, he, saith, “solus, imperantium, vespasianus, mutatus, in, melius, ”[138], though, the, one, was, meant, of, sufficiency, the, other, of, manners, and, affection, it, is, an, assured, sign, of, a, worthy, and, generous, spirit, whom, honor, amends, for, honor, is, or, should, be, the, place, of, virtue, and, as, in, nature, things, move, violently, to, their, place, and, calmly, in, their, place, so, virtue, in, ambition, is, violent, in, authority, settled, and, calm, all, rising, to, great, place, is, by, a, winding, stair, and, if, there, be, factions, it, is, good, to, side, a, man’s, self, whilst, he, is, in, the, rising, and, to, balance, himself, when, he, is, placed, use, the, memory, of, thy, predecessor, fairly, and, tenderly, for, if, thou, dost, not, it, is, a, debt, will, sure, be, paid, when, thou, art, gone, if, thou, have, colleagues, respect, them, and, rather, call, them, when, they, look, not, for, it, than, exclude, them, when, they, have, reason, to, look, to, be, called, be, not, too, sensible, or, too, remembering, of, thy, place, in, conversation, and, private, answers, to, suitors, but, let, it, rather, be, said, “when, he, sits, in, place, he, is, another, man, ”, it, is, a, trivial, grammar-school, text, but, yet, worthy, a, wise, man’s, consideration, question, was, asked, of, demosthenes, what, was, the, chief, part, of, an, orator, he, answered, action, what, next, —action, what, next, again, —action, [139], he, said, it, that, knew, it, best, and, had, by, nature, himself, no, advantage, in, that, he, commended, strange, thing, that, that, part, of, an, orator, which, is, but, superficial, and, rather, the, virtue, of, a, player, should, be, placed, so, high, above, those, other, noble, parts, of, invention, elocution, and, the, rest, nay, almost, alone, as, if, it, were, all, in, all, but, the, reason, is, plain, there, is, in, human, nature, generally, more, of, the, fool, than, of, the, wise, and, therefore, those, faculties, by, which, the, foolish, part, of, men’s, minds, is, taken, are, most, potent, wonderful, like, is, the, case, of, boldness, in, civil, business, what, first, —boldness, what, second, and, third, —boldness, and, yet, boldness, is, a, child, of, ignorance, and, baseness, far, inferior, to, other, parts, but, nevertheless, it, doth, fascinate, and, bind, hand, and, foot, those, that, are, either, shallow, in, judgment, or, weak, in, courage, which, are, the, greatest, part, yea, and, prevaileth, with, wise, man, at, weak, times, therefore, we, see, it, hath, done, wonders, in, popular, states, but, with, senates, and, princes, less, and, more, ever, upon, the, first, entrance, of, bold, persons, into, action, than, soon, after, for, boldness, is, an, ill, keeper, of, promise, surely, as, there, are, mountebanks, for, the, natural, body, so, are, there, mountebanks, for, the, politic, body, men, that, undertake, great, cures, and, perhaps, have, been, lucky, in, two, or, three, experiments, but, want, the, grounds, of, science, and, therefore, cannot, hold, out, nay, you, shall, see, a, bold, fellow, many, times, do, mahomet’s, miracle, mahomet, made, the, people, believe, that, he, would, call, a, hill, to, him, and, from, the, top, of, it, offer, up, his, prayers, for, the, observers, of, his, law, the, people, assembled, mahomet, called, the, hill, to, come, to, him, again, and, again, and, when, the, hill, stood, still, he, was, never, a, whit, abashed, but, said, “if, the, hill, will, not, come, to, mahomet, mahomet, will, go, to, the, hill, ”, so, these, men, when, they, have, promised, great, matters, and, failed, most, shamefully, yet, if, they, have, the, perfection, of, boldness, they, will, but, slight, it, over, and, make, a, turn, and, no, more, ado, certainly, to, men, of, great, judgment, bold, persons, are, a, sport, to, behold, nay, and, to, the, vulgar, also, boldness, hath, somewhat, of, the, ridiculous, for, if, absurdity, be, the, subject, of, laughter, doubt, you, not, but, great, boldness, is, seldom, without, some, absurdity, especially, it, is, a, sport, to, see, when, a, bold, fellow, is, out, of, countenance, for, that, puts, his, face, into, a, most, shrunken, and, wooden, posture, as, needs, it, must, for, in, bashfulness, the, spirits, do, a, little, go, and, come, but, with, bold, men, upon, like, occasion, they, stand, at, a, stay, like, a, stale, at, chess, where, it, is, no, mate, but, yet, the, game, cannot, stir, but, this, last, were, fitter, for, a, satire, than, for, a, serious, observation, this, is, well, to, be, weighed, that, boldness, is, ever, blind, for, it, seeth, not, dangers, and, inconveniences, therefore, it, is, ill, in, counsel, good, in, execution, so, that, the, right, use, of, bold, persons, is, that, they, never, command, in, chief, but, be, seconds, and, under, the, direction, of, others, for, in, counsel, it, is, good, to, see, dangers, and, in, execution, not, to, see, them, except, they, be, very, great, take, goodness, in, this, sense, the, affecting, of, the, weal, of, men, which, is, that, the, grecians, call, _philanthropia_, and, the, word, humanity, as, it, is, used, is, a, little, too, light, to, express, it, goodness, call, the, habit, and, goodness, of, nature, the, inclination, this, of, all, virtues, and, dignities, of, the, mind, is, the, greatest, being, the, character, of, the, deity, and, without, it, man, is, a, busy, mischievous, wretched, thing, no, better, than, a, kind, of, vermin, goodness, answers, to, the, theological, virtue, charity, and, admits, no, excess, but, error, the, desire, of, power, in, excess, caused, the, angels, to, fall, [140], the, desire, of, knowledge, in, excess, caused, man, to, fall, but, in, charity, there, is, no, excess, neither, can, angel, or, man, come, in, danger, by, it, the, inclination, to, goodness, is, imprinted, deeply, in, the, nature, of, man, insomuch, that, if, it, issue, not, towards, men, it, will, take, unto, other, living, creatures, as, it, is, seen, in, the, turks, a, cruel, people, who, nevertheless, are, kind, to, beasts, and, give, alms, to, dogs, and, birds, insomuch, as, busbechius[141], reporteth, a, christian, boy, in, constantinople, had, like, to, have, been, stoned, for, gagging, in, a, waggishness, a, long-billed, fowl, [142], errors, indeed, in, this, virtue, of, goodness, or, charity, may, be, committed, the, italians, have, an, ungracious, proverb, “tanto, buon, che, val, niente, ”, “so, good, that, he, is, good, for, nothing, ”, and, one, of, the, doctors, of, italy, nicholas, machiavel, [143], had, the, confidence, to, put, in, writing, almost, in, plain, terms, “that, the, christian, faith, had, given, up, good, men, in, prey, to, those, that, are, tyrannical, and, unjust, ”[144], which, he, spake, because, indeed, there, was, never, law, or, sect, or, opinion, did, so, much, magnify, goodness, as, the, christian, religion, doth, therefore, to, avoid, the, scandal, and, the, danger, both, it, is, good, to, take, knowledge, of, the, errors, of, a, habit, so, excellent, seek, the, good, of, other, men, but, be, not, in, bondage, to, their, faces, or, fancies, for, that, is, but, facility, or, softness, which, taketh, an, honest, mind, prisoner, neither, give, thou, æsop’s, cock, a, gem, who, would, be, better, pleased, and, happier, if, he, had, had, a, barley-corn, the, example, of, god, teacheth, the, lesson, truly, “he, sendeth, his, rain, and, maketh, his, sun, to, shine, upon, the, just, and, the, unjust, ”[145], but, he, doth, not, rain, wealth, nor, shine, honor, and, virtues, upon, men, equally, common, benefits, are, to, be, communicate, with, all, but, peculiar, benefits, with, choice, and, beware, how, in, making, the, portraiture, thou, breakest, the, pattern, for, divinity, maketh, the, love, of, ourselves, the, pattern, the, love, of, our, neighbors, but, the, portraiture, “sell, all, thou, hast, and, give, it, to, the, poor, and, follow, me, ”[146], but, sell, not, all, thou, hast, except, thou, come, and, follow, me, that, is, except, thou, have, a, vocation, wherein, thou, mayest, do, as, much, good, with, little, means, as, with, great, for, otherwise, in, feeding, the, streams, thou, driest, the, fountain, neither, is, there, only, a, habit, of, goodness, directed, by, right, reason, but, there, is, in, some, men, even, in, nature, a, disposition, towards, it, as, on, the, other, side, there, is, a, natural, malignity, for, there, be, that, in, their, nature, do, not, affect, the, good, of, others, the, lighter, sort, of, malignity, turneth, but, to, a, crossness, or, frowardness, or, aptness, to, oppose, or, difficileness, or, the, like, but, the, deeper, sort, to, envy, and, mere, mischief, such, men, in, other, men’s, calamities, are, as, it, were, in, season, and, are, ever, on, the, loading, part, not, so, good, as, the, dogs, that, licked, lazarus’s, sores, [147], but, like, flies, that, are, still, buzzing, upon, any, thing, that, is, raw, misanthropi, that, make, it, their, practice, to, bring, men, to, the, bough, and, yet, have, never, a, tree, for, the, purpose, in, their, gardens, as, timon[148], had, such, dispositions, are, the, very, errors, of, human, nature, and, yet, they, are, the, fittest, timber, to, make, great, politics, of, like, to, knee, timber, [149], that, is, good, for, ships, that, are, ordained, to, be, tossed, but, not, for, building, houses, that, shall, stand, firm, the, parts, and, signs, of, goodness, are, many, if, a, man, be, gracious, and, courteous, to, strangers, it, shows, he, is, a, citizen, of, the, world, and, that, his, heart, is, no, island, cut, off, from, other, lands, but, a, continent, that, joins, to, them, if, he, be, compassionate, towards, the, afflictions, of, others, it, shows, that, his, heart, is, like, the, noble, tree, that, is, wounded, itself, when, it, gives, the, balm, [150], if, he, easily, pardons, and, remits, offences, it, shows, that, his, mind, is, planted, above, injuries, so, that, he, cannot, be, shot, if, he, be, thankful, for, small, benefits, it, shows, that, he, weighs, men’s, minds, and, not, their, trash, but, above, all, if, he, have, st, paul’s, perfection, that, he, would, wish, to, be, an, anathema[151], from, christ, for, the, salvation, of, his, brethren, it, shows, much, of, a, divine, nature, and, a, kind, of, conformity, with, christ, himself, we, will, speak, of, nobility, first, as, a, portion, of, an, estate, then, as, a, condition, of, particular, persons, monarchy, where, there, is, no, nobility, at, all, is, ever, a, pure, and, absolute, tyranny, as, that, of, the, turks, for, nobility, attempers, sovereignty, and, draws, the, eyes, of, the, people, somewhat, aside, from, the, line, royal, but, for, democracies, they, need, it, not, and, they, are, commonly, more, quiet, and, less, subject, to, sedition, than, where, there, are, stirps, of, nobles, for, men’s, eyes, are, upon, the, business, and, not, upon, the, persons, or, if, upon, the, persons, it, is, for, the, business, sake, as, fittest, and, not, for, flags, and, pedigree, we, see, the, switzers, last, well, notwithstanding, their, diversity, of, religion, and, of, cantons, for, utility, is, their, bond, and, not, respects, [152], the, united, provinces, of, the, low, countries[153], in, their, government, excel, for, where, there, is, an, equality, the, consultations, are, more, indifferent, and, the, payments, and, tributes, more, cheerful, great, and, potent, nobility, addeth, majesty, to, a, monarch, but, diminisheth, power, and, putteth, life, and, spirit, into, the, people, but, presseth, their, fortune, it, is, well, when, nobles, are, not, too, great, for, sovereignty, nor, for, justice, and, yet, maintained, in, that, height, as, the, insolency, of, inferiors, may, be, broken, upon, them, before, it, come, on, too, fast, upon, the, majesty, of, kings, numerous, nobility, causeth, poverty, and, inconvenience, in, a, state, for, it, is, a, surcharge, of, expense, and, besides, it, being, of, necessity, that, many, of, the, nobility, fall, in, time, to, be, weak, in, fortune, it, maketh, a, kind, of, disproportion, between, honor, and, means, as, for, nobility, in, particular, persons, it, is, a, reverend, thing, to, see, an, ancient, castle, or, building, not, in, decay, or, to, see, a, fair, timber-tree, sound, and, perfect, how, much, more, to, behold, an, ancient, noble, family, which, hath, stood, against, the, waves, and, weathers, of, time, for, new, nobility, is, but, the, act, of, power, but, ancient, nobility, is, the, act, of, time, those, that, are, first, raised, to, nobility, are, commonly, more, virtuous, [154], but, less, innocent, than, their, descendants, for, there, is, rarely, any, rising, but, by, a, commixture, of, good, and, evil, arts, but, it, is, reason, the, memory, of, their, virtues, remain, to, their, posterity, and, their, faults, die, with, themselves, nobility, of, birth, commonly, abateth, industry, and, he, that, is, not, industrious, envieth, him, that, is, besides, noble, persons, cannot, go, much, higher, and, he, that, standeth, at, a, stay, when, others, rise, can, hardly, avoid, motions, of, envy, [155], on, the, other, side, nobility, extinguisheth, the, passive, envy, from, others, towards, them, because, they, are, in, possession, of, honor, certainly, kings, that, have, able, men, of, their, nobility, shall, find, ease, in, employing, them, and, a, better, slide, into, their, business, for, people, naturally, bend, to, them, as, born, in, some, sort, to, command, shepherds, of, people, had, need, know, the, calendars, of, tempests, in, state, which, are, commonly, greatest, when, things, grow, to, equality, as, natural, tempests, are, greatest, about, the, equinoctia, [156], and, as, there, are, certain, hollow, blasts, of, wind, and, secret, swellings, of, seas, before, a, tempest, so, are, there, in, states, —, “ille, etiam, cæcos, instare, tumultus, sæpe, monet, fraudesque, et, operta, tumescere, bella, ”[157], libels, and, licentious, discourses, against, the, state, when, they, are, frequent, and, open, and, in, like, sort, false, news, often, running, up, and, down, to, the, disadvantage, of, the, state, and, hastily, embraced, are, amongst, the, signs, of, troubles, virgil, giving, the, pedigree, of, fame, saith, she, was, sister, to, the, giants, —, “illam, terra, parens, irâ, irritata, deorum, extremam, (ut, perhibent), cœo, enceladoque, sororem, progenuit, ”[158], as, if, fames, were, the, relics, of, seditions, past, but, they, are, no, less, indeed, the, preludes, of, seditions, to, come, howsoever, he, noteth, it, right, that, seditious, tumults, and, seditious, fames, differ, no, more, but, as, brother, and, sister, masculine, and, feminine, especially, if, it, come, to, that, that, the, best, actions, of, a, state, and, the, most, plausible, and, which, ought, to, give, greatest, contentment, are, taken, in, ill, sense, and, traduced, for, that, shows, the, envy, great, as, tacitus, saith, “conflatâ, magnâ, invidiâ, seu, bene, seu, male, gesta, premunt, ”[159], neither, doth, it, follow, that, because, these, fames, are, a, sign, of, troubles, that, the, suppressing, of, them, with, too, much, severity, should, be, a, remedy, of, troubles, for, the, despising, of, them, many, times, checks, them, best, and, the, going, about, to, stop, them, doth, but, make, a, wonder, long-lived, also, that, kind, of, obedience, which, tacitus, speaketh, of, is, to, be, held, suspected, “erant, in, officio, sed, tamen, qui, mallent, imperantium, mandata, interpretari, quam, exsequi, ”[160], disputing, excusing, cavilling, upon, mandates, and, directions, is, a, kind, of, shaking, off, the, yoke, and, assay, of, disobedience, especially, if, in, those, disputings, they, which, are, for, the, direction, speak, fearfully, and, tenderly, and, those, that, are, against, it, audaciously, also, as, machiavel, noteth, well, when, princes, that, ought, to, be, common, parents, make, themselves, as, a, party, and, lean, to, a, side, it, is, as, a, boat, that, is, overthrown, by, uneven, weight, on, the, one, side, as, was, well, seen, in, the, time, of, henry, the, third, of, france, for, first, himself, entered, league[161], for, the, extirpation, of, the, protestants, and, presently, after, the, same, league, was, turned, upon, himself, for, when, the, authority, of, princes, is, made, but, an, accessary, to, a, cause, and, that, there, be, other, bands, that, tie, faster, than, the, band, of, sovereignty, kings, begin, to, be, put, almost, out, of, possession, also, when, discords, and, quarrels, and, factions, are, carried, openly, and, audaciously, it, is, a, sign, the, reverence, of, government, is, lost, for, the, motions, of, the, greatest, persons, in, a, government, ought, to, be, as, the, motions, of, the, planets, under, “primum, mobile, ”[162], according, to, the, old, opinion, which, is, that, every, of, them, is, carried, swiftly, by, the, highest, motion, and, softly, in, their, own, motion, and, therefore, when, great, ones, in, their, own, particular, motion, move, violently, and, as, tacitus, expresseth, it, well, “liberius, quam, ut, imperantium, meminissent, ”[163], it, is, a, sign, the, orbs, are, out, of, frame, for, reverence, is, that, wherewith, princes, are, girt, from, god, who, threateneth, the, dissolving, thereof, “solvam, cingula, regum, ”[164], so, when, any, of, the, four, pillars, of, government, are, mainly, shaken, or, weakened, (which, are, religion, justice, counsel, and, treasure), men, had, need, to, pray, for, fair, weather, but, let, us, pass, from, this, part, of, predictions, (concerning, which, nevertheless, more, light, may, be, taken, from, that, which, followeth), and, let, us, speak, first, of, the, materials, of, seditions, then, of, the, motives, of, them, and, thirdly, of, the, remedies, concerning, the, materials, of, seditions, it, is, a, thing, well, to, be, considered, for, the, surest, way, to, prevent, seditions, (if, the, times, do, bear, it), is, to, take, away, the, matter, of, them, for, if, there, be, fuel, prepared, it, is, hard, to, tell, whence, the, spark, shall, come, that, shall, set, it, on, fire, the, matter, of, seditions, is, of, two, kinds, much, poverty, and, much, discontentment, it, is, certain, so, many, overthrown, estates, so, many, votes, for, troubles, lucan, noteth, well, the, state, of, rome, before, the, civil, war, —, “hinc, usura, vorax, rapidumque, in, tempore, fœnus, hinc, concussa, fides, et, multis, utile, bellum, ”[165], this, same, “multis, utile, bellum, ”[166], is, an, assured, and, infallible, sign, of, a, state, disposed, to, seditions, and, troubles, and, if, this, poverty, and, broken, estate, in, the, better, sort, be, joined, with, a, want, and, necessity, in, the, mean, people, the, danger, is, imminent, and, great, for, the, rebellions, of, the, belly, are, the, worst, as, for, discontentments, they, are, in, the, politic, body, like, to, humors, in, the, natural, which, are, apt, to, gather, a, preternatural, heat, and, to, inflame, and, let, no, prince, measure, the, danger, of, them, by, this, whether, they, be, just, or, unjust, for, that, were, to, imagine, people, to, be, too, reasonable, who, do, often, spurn, at, their, own, good, nor, yet, by, this, whether, the, griefs, whereupon, they, rise, be, in, fact, great, or, small, for, they, are, the, most, dangerous, discontentments, where, the, fear, is, greater, than, the, feeling, “dolendi, modus, timendi, non, item, ”[167], besides, in, great, oppressions, the, same, things, that, provoke, the, patience, do, withal, mate[168], the, courage, but, in, fears, it, is, not, so, neither, let, any, prince, or, state, be, secure, concerning, discontentments, because, they, have, been, often, or, have, been, long, and, yet, no, peril, hath, ensued, for, as, it, is, true, that, every, vapor, or, fume, doth, not, turn, into, a, storm, so, it, is, nevertheless, true, that, storms, though, they, blow, over, divers, times, yet, may, fall, at, last, and, as, the, spanish, proverb, noteth, well, “the, cord, breaketh, at, the, last, by, the, weakest, pull, ”[169], the, causes, and, motives, of, seditions, are, innovation, in, religion, taxes, alteration, of, laws, and, customs, breaking, of, privileges, general, oppression, advancement, of, unworthy, persons, strangers, dearths, disbanded, soldiers, factions, grown, desperate, and, whatsoever, in, offending, people, joineth, and, knitteth, them, in, a, common, cause, for, the, remedies, there, may, be, some, general, preservatives, whereof, we, will, speak, as, for, the, just, cure, it, must, answer, to, the, particular, disease, and, so, be, left, to, counsel, rather, than, rule, the, first, remedy, or, prevention, is, to, remove, by, all, means, possible, that, material, cause, of, sedition, whereof, we, spake, which, is, want, and, poverty, in, the, estate, [170], to, which, purpose, serveth, the, opening, and, well-balancing, of, trade, the, cherishing, of, manufactures, the, banishing, of, idleness, the, repressing, of, waste, and, excess, by, sumptuary, laws, [171], the, improvement, and, husbanding, of, the, soil, the, regulating, of, prices, of, things, vendible, the, moderating, of, taxes, and, tributes, and, the, like, generally, it, is, to, be, foreseen, that, the, population, of, a, kingdom, (especially, if, it, be, not, mown, down, by, wars), do, not, exceed, the, stock, of, the, kingdom, which, should, maintain, them, neither, is, the, population, to, be, reckoned, only, by, number, for, a, smaller, number, that, spend, more, and, earn, less, do, wear, out, an, estate, sooner, than, a, greater, number, that, live, lower, and, gather, more, therefore, the, multiplying, of, nobility, and, other, degrees, of, quality, in, an, over-proportion, to, the, common, people, doth, speedily, bring, a, state, to, necessity, and, so, doth, likewise, an, overgrown, clergy, for, they, bring, nothing, to, the, stock, [172], and, in, like, manner, when, more, are, bred, scholars, than, preferments, can, take, off, it, is, likewise, to, be, remembered, that, forasmuch, as, the, increase, of, any, estate, must, be, upon, the, foreigner[173], (for, whatsoever, is, somewhere, gotten, is, somewhere, lost), there, be, but, three, things, which, one, nation, selleth, unto, another, the, commodity, as, nature, yieldeth, it, the, manufacture, and, the, vecture, or, carriage, so, that, if, these, three, wheels, go, wealth, will, flow, as, in, a, spring, tide, and, it, cometh, many, times, to, pass, that, “materiam, superabit, opus, ”[174], that, the, work, and, carriage, is, more, worth, than, the, material, and, enricheth, a, state, more, as, is, notably, seen, in, the, low, countrymen, who, have, the, best, mines[175], above, ground, in, the, world, above, all, things, good, policy, is, to, be, used, that, the, treasure, and, moneys, in, a, state, be, not, gathered, into, few, hands, for, otherwise, a, state, may, have, a, great, stock, and, yet, starve, and, money, is, like, muck, [176], not, good, except, it, be, spread, this, is, done, chiefly, by, suppressing, or, at, the, least, keeping, a, strait, hand, upon, the, devouring, trades, of, usury, engrossing[177], great, pasturages, and, the, like, for, removing, discontentments, or, at, least, the, danger, of, them, there, is, in, every, state, (as, we, know), two, portions, of, subjects, the, nobles, and, the, commonalty, when, one, of, these, is, discontent, the, danger, is, not, great, for, common, people, are, of, slow, motion, if, they, be, not, excited, by, the, greater, sort, and, the, greater, sort, are, of, small, strength, except, the, multitude, be, apt, and, ready, to, move, of, themselves, then, is, the, danger, when, the, greater, sort, do, but, wait, for, the, troubling, of, the, waters, amongst, the, meaner, that, then, they, may, declare, themselves, the, poets, feign, that, the, rest, of, the, gods, would, have, bound, jupiter, which, he, hearing, of, by, the, counsel, of, pallas, sent, for, briareus, with, his, hundred, hands, to, come, in, to, his, aid, an, emblem, no, doubt, to, show, how, safe, it, is, for, monarchs, to, make, sure, of, the, good-will, of, common, people, to, give, moderate, liberty, for, griefs, and, discontentments, to, evaporate, (so, it, be, without, too, great, insolency, or, bravery), is, a, safe, way, for, he, that, turneth, the, humors, back, and, maketh, the, wound, bleed, inwards, endangereth, malign, ulcers, and, pernicious, imposthumations, the, part, of, epimetheus[178], might, well, become, prometheus, in, the, case, of, discontentments, for, there, is, not, a, better, provision, against, them, epimetheus, when, griefs, and, evils, flew, abroad, at, last, shut, the, lid, and, kept, hope, in, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, certainly, the, politic, and, artificial, nourishing, and, entertaining, of, hopes, and, carrying, men, from, hopes, to, hopes, is, one, of, the, best, antidotes, against, the, poison, of, discontentments, and, it, is, a, certain, sign, of, a, wise, government, and, proceeding, when, it, can, hold, men’s, hearts, by, hopes, when, it, cannot, by, satisfaction, and, when, it, can, handle, things, in, such, manner, as, no, evil, shall, appear, so, peremptory, but, that, it, hath, some, outlet, of, hope, which, is, the, less, hard, to, do, because, both, particular, persons, and, factions, are, apt, enough, to, flatter, themselves, or, at, least, to, brave, that, which, they, believe, not, also, the, foresight, and, prevention, that, there, be, no, likely, or, fit, head, whereunto, discontented, persons, may, resort, and, under, whom, they, may, join, is, a, known, but, an, excellent, point, of, caution, understand, a, fit, head, to, be, one, that, hath, greatness, and, reputation, that, hath, confidence, with, the, discontented, party, and, upon, whom, they, turn, their, eyes, and, that, is, thought, discontented, in, his, own, particular, which, kind, of, persons, are, either, to, be, won, and, reconciled, to, the, state, and, that, in, a, fast, and, true, manner, or, to, be, fronted, with, some, other, of, the, same, party, that, may, oppose, them, and, so, divide, the, reputation, generally, the, dividing, and, breaking, of, all, factions, and, combinations, that, are, adverse, to, the, state, and, setting, them, at, distance, or, at, least, distrust, amongst, themselves, is, not, one, of, the, worst, remedies, for, it, is, a, desperate, case, if, those, that, hold, with, the, proceeding, of, the, state, be, full, of, discord, and, faction, and, those, that, are, against, it, be, entire, and, united, have, noted, that, some, witty, and, sharp, speeches, which, have, fallen, from, princes, have, given, fire, to, seditions, cæsar, did, himself, infinite, hurt, in, that, speech—“sylla, nescivit, literas, non, potuit, dictare, ”[179], for, it, did, utterly, cut, off, that, hope, which, men, had, entertained, that, he, would, at, one, time, or, other, give, over, his, dictatorship, galba, undid, himself, by, that, speech, “legi, a, se, militem, non, emi, ”[180], for, it, put, the, soldiers, out, of, hope, of, the, donative, probus, likewise, by, that, speech, “si, vixero, non, opus, erit, amplius, romano, imperio, militibus, ”[181], a, speech, of, great, despair, for, the, soldiers, and, many, the, like, surely, princes, had, need, in, tender, matters, and, ticklish, times, to, beware, what, they, say, especially, in, these, short, speeches, which, fly, abroad, like, darts, and, are, thought, to, be, shot, out, of, their, secret, intentions, for, as, for, large, discourses, they, are, flat, things, and, not, so, much, noted, lastly, let, princes, against, all, events, not, be, without, some, great, person, one, or, rather, more, of, military, valor, near, unto, them, for, the, repressing, of, seditions, in, their, beginnings, for, without, that, there, useth, to, be, more, trepidation, in, court, upon, the, first, breaking, out, of, troubles, than, were, fit, and, the, state, runneth, the, danger, of, that, which, tacitus, saith, “atque, is, habitus, animorum, fuit, ut, pessimum, facinus, auderent, pauci, plures, vellent, omnes, paterentur, ”[182], but, let, such, military, persons, be, assured, and, well, reputed, of, rather, than, factious, and, popular, holding, also, good, correspondence, with, the, other, great, men, in, the, state, or, else, the, remedy, is, worse, than, the, disease, had, rather, believe, all, the, fables, in, the, legends, [183], and, the, talmud, [184], and, the, alcoran, than, that, this, universal, frame, is, without, a, mind, and, therefore, god, never, wrought, miracle, to, convince, atheism, because, his, ordinary, works, convince, it, it, is, true, that, a, little, philosophy[185], inclineth, man’s, mind, to, atheism, but, depth, in, philosophy, bringeth, men’s, minds, about, to, religion, for, while, the, mind, of, man, looketh, upon, second, causes, scattered, it, may, sometimes, rest, in, them, and, go, no, further, but, when, it, beholdeth, the, chain, of, them, confederate, and, linked, together, it, must, needs, fly, to, providence, and, deity, nay, even, that, school, which, is, most, accused, of, atheism, doth, most, demonstrate, religion, that, is, the, school, of, leucippus, [186], and, democritus, [187], and, epicurus, for, it, is, a, thousand, times, more, credible, that, four, mutable, elements, and, one, immutable, fifth, essence, [188], duly, and, eternally, placed, need, no, god, than, that, an, army, of, infinite, small, portions, or, seeds, unplaced, should, have, produced, this, order, and, beauty, without, a, divine, marshal, the, scripture, saith, “the, fool, hath, said, in, his, heart, there, is, no, god, ”[189], it, is, not, said, “the, fool, hath, thought, in, his, heart, ”, so, as, he, rather, saith, it, by, rote, to, himself, as, that, he, would, have, than, that, he, can, thoroughly, believe, it, or, be, persuaded, of, it, for, none, deny, there, is, a, god, but, those, for, whom, it, maketh[190], that, there, were, no, god, it, appeareth, in, nothing, more, that, atheism, is, rather, in, the, lip, than, in, the, heart, of, man, than, by, this, that, atheists, will, ever, be, talking, of, that, their, opinion, as, if, they, fainted, in, it, within, themselves, and, would, be, glad, to, be, strengthened, by, the, consent, of, others, nay, more, you, shall, have, atheists, strive, to, get, disciples, as, it, fareth, with, other, sects, and, which, is, most, of, all, you, shall, have, of, them, that, will, suffer, for, atheism, and, not, recant, whereas, if, they, did, truly, think, that, there, were, no, such, thing, as, god, why, should, they, trouble, themselves, epicurus, is, charged, that, he, did, but, dissemble, for, his, credit’s, sake, when, he, affirmed, there, were, blessed, natures, but, such, as, enjoyed, themselves, without, having, respect, to, the, government, of, the, world, wherein, they, say, he, did, temporize, though, in, secret, he, thought, there, was, no, god, but, certainly, he, is, traduced, for, his, words, are, noble, and, divine, “non, deos, vulgi, negare, profanum, sed, vulgi, opiniones, diis, applicare, profanum, ”[191], plato, could, have, said, no, more, and, although, he, had, the, confidence, to, deny, the, administration, he, had, not, the, power, to, deny, the, nature, the, indians[192], of, the, west, have, names, for, their, particular, gods, though, they, have, no, name, for, god, as, if, the, heathens, should, have, had, the, names, jupiter, apollo, mars, &c, but, not, the, word, deus, which, shows, that, even, those, barbarous, people, have, the, notion, though, they, have, not, the, latitude, and, extent, of, it, so, that, against, atheists, the, very, savages, take, part, with, the, very, subtlest, philosophers, the, contemplative, atheist, is, rare, a, diagoras, [193], a, bion, [194], a, lucian, [195], perhaps, and, some, others, and, yet, they, seem, to, be, more, than, they, are, for, that, all, that, impugn, a, received, religion, or, superstition, are, by, the, adverse, part, branded, with, the, name, of, atheists, but, the, great, atheists, indeed, are, hypocrites, which, are, ever, handling, holy, things, but, without, feeling, so, as, they, must, needs, be, cauterized, in, the, end, the, causes, of, atheism, are, divisions, in, religion, if, they, be, many, for, any, one, main, division, addeth, zeal, to, both, sides, but, many, divisions, introduce, atheism, another, is, scandal, of, priests, when, it, is, come, to, that, which, st, bernard, saith, “non, est, jam, dicere, ut, populus, sic, sacerdos, quia, nec, sic, populus, ut, sacerdos, ”[196], third, is, custom, of, profane, scoffing, in, holy, matters, which, doth, by, little, and, little, deface, the, reverence, of, religion, and, lastly, learned, times, specially, with, peace, and, prosperity, for, troubles, and, adversities, do, more, bow, men’s, minds, to, religion, they, that, deny, a, god, destroy, a, man’s, nobility, for, certainly, man, is, of, kin, to, the, beasts, by, his, body, and, if, he, be, not, of, kin, to, god, by, his, spirit, he, is, a, base, and, ignoble, creature, it, destroys, likewise, magnanimity, and, the, raising, of, human, nature, for, take, an, example, of, a, dog, and, mark, what, a, generosity, and, courage, he, will, put, on, when, he, finds, himself, maintained, by, a, man, who, to, him, is, instead, of, a, god, or, “melior, natura, ”[197], which, courage, is, manifestly, such, as, that, creature, without, that, confidence, of, a, better, nature, than, his, own, could, never, attain, so, man, when, he, resteth, and, assureth, himself, upon, divine, protection, and, favor, gathereth, a, force, and, faith, which, human, nature, in, itself, could, not, obtain, therefore, as, atheism, is, in, all, respects, hateful, so, in, this, that, it, depriveth, human, nature, of, the, means, to, exalt, itself, above, human, frailty, as, it, is, in, particular, persons, so, it, is, in, nations, never, was, there, such, a, state, for, magnanimity, as, rome, of, this, state, hear, what, cicero, saith, “quam, volumus, licet, patres, conscripti, nos, amemus, tamen, nec, numero, hispanos, nec, robore, gallos, nec, calliditate, pœnos, nec, artibus, græcos, nec, denique, hoc, ipso, hujus, gentis, et, terræ, domestico, nativoque, sensu, italos, ipsos, et, latinos, sed, pietate, ac, religione, atque, hâc, unâ, sapientiâ, quod, deorum, immortalium, numine, omnia, regi, gubernarique, perspeximus, omnes, gentes, nationesque, superavimus, ”[198], it, were, better, to, have, no, opinion, of, god, at, all, than, such, an, opinion, as, is, unworthy, of, him, for, the, one, is, unbelief, the, other, is, contumely, [199], and, certainly, superstition, is, the, reproach, of, the, deity, plutarch, saith, well, to, that, purpose, “surely, ”, saith, he, had, rather, a, great, deal, men, should, say, there, was, no, such, man, at, all, as, plutarch, than, that, they, should, say, that, there, was, one, plutarch, that, would, eat, his, children[200], as, soon, as, they, were, born, ”, as, the, poets, speak, of, saturn, and, as, the, contumely, is, greater, towards, god, so, the, danger, is, greater, towards, men, atheism, leaves, a, man, to, sense, to, philosophy, to, natural, piety, to, laws, to, reputation, all, which, may, be, guides, to, an, outward, moral, virtue, though, religion, were, not, but, superstition, dismounts, all, these, and, erecteth, an, absolute, monarchy, in, the, minds, of, men, therefore, atheism, did, never, perturb, states, for, it, makes, men, wary, of, themselves, as, looking, no, further, and, we, see, the, times, inclined, to, atheism, (as, the, time, of, augustus, cæsar), were, civil, times, but, superstition, hath, been, the, confusion, of, many, states, and, bringeth, in, a, new, _primum, mobile_, [201], that, ravisheth, all, the, spheres, of, government, the, master, of, superstition, is, the, people, and, in, all, superstition, wise, men, follow, fools, and, arguments, are, fitted, to, practice, in, a, reversed, order, it, was, gravely, said, by, some, of, the, prelates, in, the, council, of, trent, [202], where, the, doctrine, of, the, schoolmen, bare, great, sway, that, the, schoolmen, were, like, astronomers, which, did, feign, eccentrics[203], and, epicycles, [204], and, such, engines, of, orbs, to, save[205], the, phenomena, though, they, knew, there, were, no, such, things, and, in, like, manner, that, the, schoolmen, had, framed, a, number, of, subtle, and, intricate, axioms, and, theorems, to, save, the, practice, of, the, church, the, causes, of, superstition, are, pleasing, and, sensual, rites, and, ceremonies, excess, of, outward, and, pharisaical, holiness, over-great, reverence, of, traditions, which, cannot, but, load, the, church, the, stratagems, of, prelates, for, their, own, ambition, and, lucre, the, favoring, too, much, of, good, intentions, which, openeth, the, gate, to, conceits, and, novelties, the, taking, an, aim, at, divine, matters, by, human, which, cannot, but, breed, mixture, of, imaginations, and, lastly, barbarous, times, especially, joined, with, calamities, and, disasters, superstition, without, a, veil, is, a, deformed, thing, for, as, it, addeth, deformity, to, an, ape, to, be, so, like, a, man, so, the, similitude, of, superstition, to, religion, makes, it, the, more, deformed, and, as, wholesome, meat, corrupteth, to, little, worms, so, good, forms, and, orders, corrupt, into, a, number, of, petty, observances, there, is, a, superstition, in, avoiding, superstition, when, men, think, to, do, best, if, they, go, furthest, from, the, superstition, formerly, received, therefore, care, would, be, had, that, (as, it, fareth, in, ill, purgings), the, good, be, not, taken, away, with, the, bad, which, commonly, is, done, when, the, people, is, the, reformer, travel, in, the, younger, sort, is, a, part, of, education, in, the, elder, a, part, of, experience, he, that, travelleth, into, a, country, before, he, hath, some, entrance, into, the, language, goeth, to, school, and, not, to, travel, that, young, men, travel, under, some, tutor, or, grave, servant, allow, well, so, that, he, be, such, a, one, that, hath, the, language, and, hath, been, in, the, country, before, whereby, he, may, be, able, to, tell, them, what, things, are, worthy, to, be, seen, in, the, country, where, they, go, what, acquaintances, they, are, to, seek, what, exercises, or, discipline, the, place, yieldeth, for, else, young, men, shall, go, hooded, and, look, abroad, little, it, is, a, strange, thing, that, in, sea, voyages, where, there, is, nothing, to, be, seen, but, sky, and, sea, men, should, make, diaries, but, in, land, travel, wherein, so, much, is, to, be, observed, for, the, most, part, they, omit, it, as, if, chance, were, fitter, to, be, registered, than, observation, let, diaries, therefore, be, brought, in, use, the, things, to, be, seen, and, observed, are, the, courts, of, princes, especially, when, they, give, audience, to, ambassadors, the, courts, of, justice, while, they, sit, and, hear, causes, and, so, of, consistories[206], ecclesiastic, the, churches, and, monasteries, with, the, monuments, which, are, therein, extant, the, walls, and, fortifications, of, cities, and, towns, and, so, the, havens, and, harbors, antiquities, and, ruins, libraries, colleges, disputations, and, lectures, where, any, are, shipping, and, navies, houses, and, gardens, of, state, and, pleasure, near, great, cities, armories, arsenals, magazines, exchanges, burses, warehouses, exercises, of, horsemanship, fencing, training, of, soldiers, and, the, like, comedies, such, whereunto, the, better, sort, of, persons, do, resort, treasuries, of, jewels, and, robes, cabinets, and, rarities, and, to, conclude, whatsoever, is, memorable, in, the, places, where, they, go, after, all, which, the, tutors, or, servants, ought, to, make, diligent, inquiry, as, for, triumphs, masks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital, executions, and, such, shows, men, need, not, to, be, put, in, mind, of, them, yet, they, are, not, to, be, neglected, if, you, will, have, a, young, man, to, put, his, travel, into, a, little, room, and, in, short, time, to, gather, much, this, you, must, do, first, as, was, said, he, must, have, some, entrance, into, the, language, before, he, goeth, then, he, must, have, such, a, servant, or, tutor, as, knoweth, the, country, as, was, likewise, said, let, him, carry, with, him, also, some, card, or, book, describing, the, country, where, he, travelleth, which, will, be, a, good, key, to, his, inquiry, let, him, keep, also, a, diary, let, him, not, stay, long, in, one, city, or, town, more, or, less, as, the, place, deserveth, but, not, long, nay, when, he, stayeth, in, one, city, or, town, let, him, change, his, lodging, from, one, end, and, part, of, the, town, to, another, which, is, a, great, adamant, of, acquaintance, let, him, sequester, himself, from, the, company, of, his, countrymen, and, diet, in, such, places, where, there, is, good, company, of, the, nation, where, he, travelleth, let, him, upon, his, removes, from, one, place, to, another, procure, recommendation, to, some, person, of, quality, residing, in, the, place, whither, he, removeth, that, he, may, use, his, favor, in, those, things, he, desireth, to, see, or, know, thus, he, may, abridge, his, travel, with, much, profit, as, for, the, acquaintance, which, is, to, be, sought, in, travel, that, which, is, most, of, all, profitable, is, acquaintance, with, the, secretaries, and, employed, men[207], of, ambassadors, for, so, in, travelling, in, one, country, he, shall, suck, the, experience, of, many, let, him, also, see, and, visit, eminent, persons, in, all, kinds, which, are, of, great, name, abroad, that, he, may, be, able, to, tell, how, the, life, agreeth, with, the, fame, for, quarrels, they, are, with, care, and, discretion, to, be, avoided, they, are, commonly, for, mistresses, healths, [208], place, and, words, and, let, a, man, beware, how, he, keepeth, company, with, choleric, and, quarrelsome, persons, for, they, will, engage, him, into, their, own, quarrels, when, a, traveller, returneth, home, let, him, not, leave, the, countries, where, he, hath, travelled, altogether, behind, him, but, maintain, a, correspondence, by, letters, with, those, of, his, acquaintance, which, are, of, most, worth, and, let, his, travel, appear, rather, in, his, discourse, than, in, his, apparel, or, gesture, and, in, his, discourse, let, him, be, rather, advised, in, his, answers, than, forward, to, tell, stories, and, let, it, appear, that, he, doth, not, change, his, country, manners, for, those, of, foreign, parts, but, only, prick, in, some, flowers, of, that, he, hath, learned, abroad, into, the, customs, of, his, own, country, it, is, a, miserable, state, of, mind, to, have, few, things, to, desire, and, many, things, to, fear, and, yet, that, commonly, is, the, case, of, kings, who, being, at, the, highest, want, matter, of, desire, [209], which, makes, their, minds, more, languishing, and, have, many, representations, of, perils, and, shadows, which, makes, their, minds, the, less, clear, and, this, is, one, reason, also, of, that, effect, which, the, scripture, speaketh, of, “that, the, king’s, heart, is, inscrutable, ”[210], for, multitude, of, jealousies, and, lack, of, some, predominant, desire, that, should, marshal, and, put, in, order, all, the, rest, maketh, any, man’s, heart, hard, to, find, or, sound, hence, it, comes, likewise, that, princes, many, times, make, themselves, desires, and, set, their, hearts, upon, toys, sometimes, upon, a, building, sometimes, upon, erecting, of, an, order, sometimes, upon, the, advancing, of, a, person, sometimes, upon, obtaining, excellency, in, some, art, or, feat, of, the, hand, —as, nero, for, playing, on, the, harp, domitian, for, certainty, of, the, hand, with, the, arrow, commodus, for, playing, at, fence, [211], caracalla, for, driving, chariots, and, the, like, this, seemeth, incredible, unto, those, that, know, not, the, principle, that, the, mind, of, man, is, more, cheered, and, refreshed, by, profiting, in, small, things, than, by, standing, at, a, stay[212], in, great, we, see, also, that, kings, that, have, been, fortunate, conquerors, in, their, first, years, it, being, not, possible, for, them, to, go, forward, infinitely, but, that, they, must, have, some, check, or, arrest, in, their, fortunes, turn, in, their, latter, years, to, be, superstitious, and, melancholy, as, did, alexander, the, great, diocletian, [213], and, in, our, memory, charles, the, fifth, [214], and, others, for, he, that, is, used, to, go, forward, and, findeth, a, stop, falleth, out, of, his, own, favor, and, is, not, the, thing, he, was, to, speak, now, of, the, true, temper, of, empire, it, is, a, thing, rare, and, hard, to, keep, for, both, temper, and, distemper, consist, of, contraries, but, it, is, one, thing, to, mingle, contraries, another, to, interchange, them, the, answer, of, apollonius, to, vespasian, is, full, of, excellent, instruction, vespasian, asked, him, “what, was, nero’s, overthrow, ”, he, answered, “nero, could, touch, and, tune, the, harp, well, but, in, government, sometimes, he, used, to, wind, the, pins, too, high, sometimes, to, let, them, down, too, low, ”[215], and, certain, it, is, that, nothing, destroyeth, authority, so, much, as, the, unequal, and, untimely, interchange, of, power, pressed, too, far, and, relaxed, too, much, this, is, true, that, the, wisdom, of, all, these, latter, times, in, princes’, affairs, is, rather, fine, deliveries, and, shiftings, of, dangers, and, mischiefs, when, they, are, near, than, solid, and, grounded, courses, to, keep, them, aloof, but, this, is, but, to, try, masteries, with, fortune, and, let, men, beware, how, they, neglect, and, suffer, matter, of, trouble, to, be, prepared, for, no, man, can, forbid, the, spark, nor, tell, whence, it, may, come, the, difficulties, in, princes’, business, are, many, and, great, but, the, greatest, difficulty, is, often, in, their, own, mind, for, it, is, common, with, princes, (saith, tacitus), to, will, contradictories, “sunt, plerumque, regum, voluntates, vehementes, et, inter, se, contrariæ, ”[216], for, it, is, the, solecism, of, power, to, think, to, command, the, end, and, yet, not, to, endure, the, mean, kings, have, to, deal, with, their, neighbors, their, wives, their, children, their, prelates, or, clergy, their, nobles, their, second, nobles, or, gentlemen, their, merchants, their, commons, and, their, men, of, war, and, from, all, these, arise, dangers, if, care, and, circumspection, be, not, used, first, for, their, neighbors, there, can, no, general, rule, be, given, (the, occasions, are, so, variable), save, one, which, ever, holdeth, which, is, that, princes, do, keep, due, sentinel, that, none, of, their, neighbors, do, overgrow, so, (by, increase, of, territory, by, embracing, of, trade, by, approaches, or, the, like), as, they, become, more, able, to, annoy, them, than, they, were, and, this, is, generally, the, work, of, standing, counsels, to, foresee, and, to, hinder, it, during, that, triumvirate, of, kings, king, henry, the, eighth, of, england, francis, the, first, king, of, france, [217], and, charles, the, fifth, emperor, there, was, such, a, watch, kept, that, none, of, the, three, could, win, a, palm, of, ground, but, the, other, two, would, straightways, balance, it, either, by, confederation, or, if, need, were, by, a, war, and, would, not, in, any, wise, take, up, peace, at, interest, and, the, like, was, done, by, that, league, (which, guicciardini[218], saith, was, the, security, of, italy), made, between, ferdinando, king, of, naples, lorenzius, medicis, and, ludovicus, sforza, potentates, the, one, of, florence, the, other, of, milan, neither, is, the, opinion, of, some, of, the, schoolmen, to, be, received, that, a, war, cannot, justly, be, made, but, upon, a, precedent, injury, or, provocation, for, there, is, no, question, but, a, just, fear, of, an, imminent, danger, though, there, be, no, blow, given, is, a, lawful, cause, of, a, war, for, their, wives, there, are, cruel, examples, of, them, livia, is, infamed[219], for, the, poisoning, of, her, husband, roxolana, solyman’s, wife, [220], was, the, destruction, of, that, renowned, prince, sultan, mustapha, and, otherwise, troubled, his, house, and, succession, edward, the, second, of, england’s, queen[221], had, the, principal, hand, in, the, deposing, and, murder, of, her, husband, this, kind, of, danger, is, then, to, be, feared, chiefly, when, the, wives, have, plots, for, the, raising, of, their, own, children, or, else, that, they, be, advoutresses, [222], for, their, children, the, tragedies, likewise, of, dangers, from, them, have, been, many, and, generally, the, entering, of, fathers, into, suspicion, of, their, children, hath, been, ever, unfortunate, the, destruction, of, mustapha, (that, we, named, before), was, so, fatal, to, solyman’s, line, as, the, succession, of, the, turks, from, solyman, until, this, day, is, suspected, to, be, untrue, and, of, strange, blood, for, that, selymus, the, second, was, thought, to, be, supposititious, [223], the, destruction, of, crispus, a, young, prince, of, rare, towardness, by, constantinus, the, great, his, father, was, in, like, manner, fatal, to, his, house, for, both, constantinus, and, constance, his, sons, died, violent, deaths, and, constantius, his, other, son, did, little, better, who, died, indeed, of, sickness, but, after, that, julianus, had, taken, arms, against, him, the, destruction, of, demetrius, [224], son, to, philip, the, second, of, macedon, turned, upon, the, father, who, died, of, repentance, and, many, like, examples, there, are, but, few, or, none, where, the, fathers, had, good, by, such, distrust, except, it, were, where, the, sons, were, up, in, open, arms, against, them, as, was, selymus, the, first, against, bajazet, and, the, three, sons, of, henry, the, second, king, of, england, for, their, prelates, when, they, are, proud, and, great, there, is, also, danger, from, them, as, it, was, in, the, times, of, anselmus[225], and, thomas, becket, archbishops, of, canterbury, who, with, their, crosiers, did, almost, try, it, with, the, king’s, sword, and, yet, they, had, to, deal, with, stout, and, haughty, kings, william, rufus, henry, the, first, and, henry, the, second, the, danger, is, not, from, that, state, but, where, it, hath, a, dependence, of, foreign, authority, or, where, the, churchmen, come, in, and, are, elected, not, by, the, collation, of, the, king, or, particular, patrons, but, by, the, people, for, their, nobles, to, keep, them, at, a, distance, it, is, not, amiss, but, to, depress, them, may, make, a, king, more, absolute, but, less, safe, and, less, able, to, perform, anything, that, he, desires, have, noted, it, in, my, history, of, king, henry, the, seventh, of, england, who, depressed, his, nobility, whereupon, it, came, to, pass, that, his, times, were, full, of, difficulties, and, troubles, for, the, nobility, though, they, continued, loyal, unto, him, yet, did, they, not, coöperate, with, him, in, his, business, so, that, in, effect, he, was, fain, to, do, all, things, himself, for, their, second, nobles, there, is, not, much, danger, from, them, being, a, body, dispersed, they, may, sometimes, discourse, high, but, that, doth, little, hurt, besides, they, are, a, counterpoise, to, the, higher, nobility, that, they, grow, not, too, potent, and, lastly, being, the, most, immediate, in, authority, with, the, common, people, they, do, best, temper, popular, commotions, for, their, merchants, they, are, “vena, porta, ”[226], and, if, they, flourish, not, a, kingdom, may, have, good, limbs, but, will, have, empty, veins, and, nourish, little, taxes, and, imposts, upon, them, do, seldom, good, to, the, king’s, revenue, for, that, which, he, wins[227], in, the, hundred[228], he, loseth, in, the, shire, the, particular, rates, being, increased, but, the, total, bulk, of, trading, rather, decreased, for, their, commons, there, is, little, danger, from, them, except, it, be, where, they, have, great, and, potent, heads, or, where, you, meddle, with, the, point, of, religion, or, their, customs, or, means, of, life, for, their, men, of, war, it, is, a, dangerous, state, where, they, live, and, remain, in, a, body, and, are, used, to, donatives, whereof, we, see, examples, in, the, janizaries[229], and, prætorian, bands, of, rome, but, trainings, of, men, and, arming, them, in, several, places, and, under, several, commanders, and, without, donatives, are, things, of, defence, and, no, danger, princes, are, like, to, heavenly, bodies, which, cause, good, or, evil, times, and, which, have, much, veneration, but, no, rest, all, precepts, concerning, kings, are, in, effect, comprehended, in, those, two, remembrances, “memento, quod, es, homo, ”[230], and, “memento, quod, es, deus, ”[231], or, “vice, dei, ”[232], the, one, bridleth, their, power, and, the, other, their, will, the, greatest, trust, between, man, and, man, is, the, trust, of, giving, counsel, for, in, other, confidences, men, commit, the, parts, of, life, their, lands, their, goods, their, children, their, credit, some, particular, affair, but, to, such, as, they, make, their, counsellors, they, commit, the, whole, by, how, much, the, more, they, are, obliged, to, all, faith, and, integrity, the, wisest, princes, need, not, think, it, any, diminution, to, their, greatness, or, derogation, to, their, sufficiency, to, rely, upon, counsel, god, himself, is, not, without, but, hath, made, it, one, of, the, great, names, of, his, blessed, son, “the, counsellor, ”[233], solomon, hath, pronounced, that, “in, counsel, is, stability, ”[234], things, will, have, their, first, or, second, agitation, if, they, be, not, tossed, upon, the, arguments, of, counsel, they, will, be, tossed, upon, the, waves, of, fortune, and, be, full, of, inconstancy, doing, and, undoing, like, the, reeling, of, a, drunken, man, solomon’s, son[235], found, the, force, of, counsel, as, his, father, saw, the, necessity, of, it, for, the, beloved, kingdom, of, god, was, first, rent, and, broken, by, ill, counsel, upon, which, counsel, there, are, set, for, our, instruction, the, two, marks, whereby, bad, counsel, is, forever, best, discerned, that, it, was, young, counsel, for, the, persons, and, violent, counsel, for, the, matter, the, ancient, times, do, set, forth, in, figure, both, the, incorporation, and, inseparable, conjunction, of, counsel, with, kings, and, the, wise, and, politic, use, of, counsel, by, kings, the, one, in, that, they, say, jupiter, did, marry, metis, which, signifieth, counsel, whereby, they, intend, that, sovereignty, is, married, to, counsel, the, other, in, that, which, followeth, which, was, thus, they, say, after, jupiter, was, married, to, metis, she, conceived, by, him, and, was, with, child, but, jupiter, suffered, her, not, to, stay, till, she, brought, forth, but, eat, her, up, whereby, he, became, himself, with, child, and, was, delivered, of, pallas, armed, out, of, his, head, [236], which, monstrous, fable, containeth, a, secret, of, empire, how, kings, are, to, make, use, of, their, council, of, state, that, first, they, ought, to, refer, matters, unto, them, which, is, the, first, begetting, or, impregnation, but, when, they, are, elaborate, moulded, and, shaped, in, the, womb, of, their, counsel, and, grow, ripe, and, ready, to, be, brought, forth, that, then, they, suffer, not, their, council, to, go, through, with, the, resolution, and, direction, as, if, it, depended, on, them, but, take, the, matter, back, into, their, own, hands, and, make, it, appear, to, the, world, that, the, decrees, and, final, directions, (which, because, they, come, forth, with, prudence, and, power, are, resembled, to, pallas, armed), proceeded, from, themselves, and, not, only, from, their, authority, but, (the, more, to, add, reputation, to, themselves), from, their, head, and, device, let, us, now, speak, of, the, inconveniences, of, counsel, and, of, the, remedies, the, inconveniences, that, have, been, noted, in, calling, and, using, counsel, are, three, first, the, revealing, of, affairs, whereby, they, become, less, secret, secondly, the, weakening, of, the, authority, of, princes, as, if, they, were, less, of, themselves, thirdly, the, danger, of, being, unfaithfully, counselled, and, more, for, the, good, of, them, that, counsel, than, of, him, that, is, counselled, for, which, inconveniences, the, doctrine, of, italy, and, practice, of, france, in, some, kings’, times, hath, introduced, cabinet, councils, a, remedy, worse, than, the, disease, [237], as, to, secrecy, princes, are, not, bound, to, communicate, all, matters, with, all, counsellors, but, may, extract, and, select, neither, is, it, necessary, that, he, that, consulteth, what, he, should, do, should, declare, what, he, will, do, but, let, princes, beware, that, the, unsecreting, of, their, affairs, comes, not, from, themselves, and, as, for, cabinet, councils, it, may, be, their, motto, “plenus, rimarum, sum, ”[238], one, futile, person, that, maketh, it, his, glory, to, tell, will, do, more, hurt, than, many, that, know, it, their, duty, to, conceal, it, is, true, there, be, some, affairs, which, require, extreme, secrecy, which, will, hardly, go, beyond, one, or, two, persons, besides, the, king, neither, are, those, counsels, unprosperous, for, besides, the, secrecy, they, commonly, go, on, constantly, in, one, spirit, of, direction, without, distraction, but, then, it, must, be, a, prudent, king, such, as, is, able, to, grind, with, a, hand-mill, [239], and, those, inward, counsellors, had, need, also, to, be, wise, men, and, especially, true, and, trusty, to, the, king’s, ends, as, it, was, with, king, henry, the, seventh, of, england, who, in, his, greatest, business, imparted, himself, to, none, except, it, were, to, morton[240], and, fox, [241], for, weakening, of, authority, the, fable[242], showeth, the, remedy, nay, the, majesty, of, kings, is, rather, exalted, than, diminished, when, they, are, in, the, chair, of, council, neither, was, there, ever, prince, bereaved, of, his, dependencies, by, his, council, except, where, there, hath, been, either, an, over-greatness, in, one, counsellor, or, an, over-strict, combination, in, divers, which, are, things, soon, found, and, holpen, [243], for, the, last, inconvenience, that, men, will, counsel, with, an, eye, to, themselves, certainly, “non, inveniet, fidem, super, terram, ”[244], is, meant, of, the, nature, of, times, [245], and, not, of, all, particular, persons, there, be, that, are, in, nature, faithful, and, sincere, and, plain, and, direct, not, crafty, and, involved, let, princes, above, all, draw, to, themselves, such, natures, besides, counsellors, are, not, commonly, so, united, but, that, one, counsellor, keepeth, sentinel, over, another, so, that, if, any, do, counsel, out, of, faction, or, private, ends, it, commonly, comes, to, the, king’s, ear, but, the, best, remedy, is, if, princes, know, their, counsellors, as, well, as, their, counsellors, know, them, —, “principis, est, virtus, maxima, nosse, suos, ”[246], and, on, the, other, side, counsellors, should, not, be, too, speculative, into, their, sovereign’s, person, the, true, composition, of, a, counsellor, is, rather, to, be, skilful, in, their, master’s, business, than, in, his, nature, [247], for, then, he, is, like, to, advise, him, and, not, to, feed, his, humor, it, is, of, singular, use, to, princes, if, they, take, the, opinions, of, their, council, both, separately, and, together, for, private, opinion, is, more, free, but, opinion, before, others, is, more, reverend, in, private, men, are, more, bold, in, their, own, humors, and, in, consort, men, are, more, obnoxious[248], to, others’, humors, therefore, it, is, good, to, take, both, and, of, the, inferior, sort, rather, in, private, to, preserve, freedom, of, the, greater, rather, in, consort, to, preserve, respect, it, is, in, vain, for, princes, to, take, counsel, concerning, matters, if, they, take, no, counsel, likewise, concerning, persons, for, all, matters, are, as, dead, images, and, the, life, of, the, execution, of, affairs, resteth, in, the, good, choice, of, persons, neither, is, it, enough, to, consult, concerning, persons, “secundum, genera, ”[249], as, in, an, idea, or, mathematical, description, what, the, kind, and, character, of, the, person, should, be, for, the, greatest, errors, are, committed, and, the, most, judgment, is, shown, in, the, choice, of, individuals, it, was, truly, said, “optimi, consiliarii, mortui, ”[250], “books, will, speak, plain, when, counsellors, blanch, ”[251], therefore, it, is, good, to, be, conversant, in, them, specially, the, books, of, such, as, themselves, have, been, actors, upon, the, stage, the, councils, at, this, day, in, most, places, are, but, familiar, meetings, where, matters, are, rather, talked, on, than, debated, and, they, run, too, swift, to, the, order, or, act, of, council, it, were, better, that, in, causes, of, weight, the, matter, were, propounded, one, day, and, not, spoken, to, till, the, next, day, “in, nocte, consilium, ”[252], so, was, it, done, in, the, commission, of, union[253], between, england, and, scotland, which, was, a, grave, and, orderly, assembly, commend, set, days, for, petitions, for, both, it, gives, the, suitors, more, certainty, for, their, attendance, and, it, frees, the, meetings, for, matters, of, estate, that, they, may, “hoc, agere, ”[254], in, choice, of, committees, for, ripening, business, for, the, council, it, is, better, to, choose, indifferent, persons, than, to, make, an, indifferency, by, putting, in, those, that, are, strong, on, both, sides, commend, also, standing, commissions, as, for, trade, for, treasure, for, war, for, suits, for, some, provinces, for, where, there, be, divers, particular, councils, and, but, one, council, of, estate, (as, it, is, in, spain), they, are, in, effect, no, more, than, standing, commissions, save, that, they, have, greater, authority, let, such, as, are, to, inform, councils, out, of, their, particular, professions, (as, lawyers, seamen, mintmen, and, the, like), be, first, heard, before, committees, and, then, as, occasion, serves, before, the, council, and, let, them, not, come, in, multitudes, or, in, a, tribunitious[255], manner, for, that, is, to, clamor, councils, not, to, inform, them, long, table, and, a, square, table, or, seats, about, the, walls, seem, things, of, form, but, are, things, of, substance, for, at, a, long, table, a, few, at, the, upper, end, in, effect, sway, all, the, business, but, in, the, other, form, there, is, more, use, of, the, counsellors’, opinions, that, sit, lower, king, when, he, presides, in, council, let, him, beware, how, he, opens, his, own, inclination, too, much, in, that, which, he, propoundeth, for, else, counsellors, will, but, take, the, wind, of, him, and, instead, of, giving, free, counsel, will, sing, him, a, song, of, “placebo, ”[256], fortune, is, like, the, market, where, many, times, if, you, can, stay, a, little, the, price, will, fall, and, again, it, is, sometimes, like, sibylla’s, offer, [257], which, at, first, offereth, the, commodity, at, full, then, consumeth, part, and, part, and, still, holdeth, up, the, price, for, occasion, (as, it, is, in, the, common, verse), “turneth, a, bald, noddle, [258], after, she, hath, presented, her, locks, in, front, and, no, hold, taken, ”, or, at, least, turneth, the, handle, of, the, bottle, first, to, be, received, and, after, the, belly, which, is, hard, to, clasp, [259], there, is, surely, no, greater, wisdom, than, well, to, time, the, beginnings, and, onsets, of, things, dangers, are, no, more, light, if, they, once, seem, light, and, more, dangers, have, deceived, men, than, forced, them, nay, it, were, better, to, meet, some, dangers, half-way, though, they, come, nothing, near, than, to, keep, too, long, a, watch, upon, their, approaches, for, if, a, man, watch, too, long, it, is, odds, he, will, fall, asleep, on, the, other, side, to, be, deceived, with, too, long, shadows, (as, some, have, been, when, the, moon, was, low, and, shone, on, their, enemies’, back), and, so, to, shoot, off, before, the, time, or, to, teach, dangers, to, come, on, by, over, early, buckling, towards, them, is, another, extreme, the, ripeness, or, unripeness, of, the, occasion, (as, we, said), must, ever, be, well, weighed, and, generally, it, is, good, to, commit, the, beginnings, of, all, great, actions, to, argus, with, his, hundred, eyes, and, the, ends, to, briareus, with, his, hundred, hands, first, to, watch, and, then, to, speed, for, the, helmet, of, pluto, [260], which, maketh, the, politic, man, go, invisible, is, secrecy, in, the, council, and, celerity, in, the, execution, for, when, things, are, once, come, to, the, execution, there, is, no, secrecy, comparable, to, celerity, like, the, motion, of, a, bullet, in, the, air, which, flieth, so, swift, as, it, outruns, the, eye, we, take, cunning, for, a, sinister, or, crooked, wisdom, and, certainly, there, is, great, difference, between, a, cunning, man, and, a, wise, man, not, only, in, point, of, honesty, but, in, point, of, ability, there, be, that, can, pack, the, cards, [261], and, yet, cannot, play, well, so, there, are, some, that, are, good, in, canvasses, and, factions, that, are, otherwise, weak, men, again, it, is, one, thing, to, understand, persons, and, another, thing, to, understand, matters, for, many, are, perfect, in, men’s, humors, that, are, not, greatly, capable, of, the, real, part, of, business, which, is, the, constitution, of, one, that, hath, studied, men, more, than, books, such, men, are, fitter, for, practice, than, for, counsel, and, they, are, good, but, in, their, own, alley, turn, them, to, new, men, and, they, have, lost, their, aim, so, as, the, old, rule, to, know, a, fool, from, a, wise, man, “mitte, ambos, nudos, ad, ignotos, et, videbis, ”[262], doth, scarce, hold, for, them, and, because, these, cunning, men, are, like, haberdashers[263], of, small, wares, it, is, not, amiss, to, set, forth, their, shop, it, is, a, point, of, cunning, to, wait, upon[264], him, with, whom, you, speak, with, your, eye, as, the, jesuits, give, it, in, precept, for, there, be, many, wise, men, that, have, secret, hearts, and, transparent, countenances, yet, this, would, be, done, with, a, demure, abasing, of, your, eye, sometimes, as, the, jesuits, also, do, use, another, is, that, when, you, have, any, thing, to, obtain, of, present, dispatch, you, entertain, and, amuse, the, party, with, whom, you, deal, with, some, other, discourse, that, he, be, not, too, much, awake, to, make, objections, knew, a, counsellor, and, secretary, that, never, came, to, queen, elizabeth, of, england, with, bills, to, sign, but, he, would, always, first, put, her, into, some, discourse, of, estate, [265], that, she, might, the, less, mind, the, bills, the, like, surprise, may, be, made, by, moving, things[266], when, the, party, is, in, haste, and, cannot, stay, to, consider, advisedly, of, that, is, moved, if, a, man, would, cross, a, business, that, he, doubts, some, other, would, handsomely, and, effectually, move, let, him, pretend, to, wish, it, well, and, move, it, himself, in, such, sort, as, may, foil, it, the, breaking, off, in, the, midst, of, that, one, was, about, to, say, as, if, he, took, himself, up, breeds, a, greater, appetite, in, him, with, whom, you, confer, to, know, more, and, because, it, works, better, when, any, thing, seemeth, to, be, gotten, from, you, by, question, than, if, you, offer, it, of, yourself, you, may, lay, a, bait, for, a, question, by, showing, another, visage, and, countenance, than, you, are, wont, to, the, end, to, give, occasion, for, the, party, to, ask, what, the, matter, is, of, the, change, as, nehemiah[267], did, “and, had, not, before, that, time, been, sad, before, the, king, ”, in, things, that, are, tender, and, unpleasing, it, is, good, to, break, the, ice, by, some, whose, words, are, of, less, weight, and, to, reserve, the, more, weighty, voice, to, come, in, as, by, chance, so, that, he, may, be, asked, the, question, upon, the, other’s, speech, as, narcissus, did, in, relating, to, claudius, the, marriage[268], of, messalina, and, silius, in, things, that, a, man, would, not, be, seen, in, himself, it, is, a, point, of, cunning, to, borrow, the, name, of, the, world, as, to, say, “the, world, says, ”, or, “there, is, a, speech, abroad, ”, knew, one, that, when, he, wrote, a, letter, he, would, put, that, which, was, most, material, in, a, postscript, as, if, it, had, been, a, by-matter, knew, another, that, when, he, came, to, have, speech, [269], he, would, pass, over, that, that, he, intended, most, and, go, forth, and, come, back, again, and, speak, of, it, as, a, thing, that, he, had, almost, forgot, some, procure, themselves, to, be, surprised, at, such, times, as, it, is, like, the, party, that, they, work, upon, will, suddenly, come, upon, them, and, to, be, found, with, a, letter, in, their, hand, or, doing, somewhat, which, they, are, not, accustomed, to, the, end, they, may, be, apposed, of[270], those, things, which, of, themselves, they, are, desirous, to, utter, it, is, a, point, of, cunning, to, let, fall, those, words, in, a, man’s, own, name, which, he, would, have, another, man, learn, and, use, and, thereupon, take, advantage, knew, two, that, were, competitors, for, the, secretary’s, place, in, queen, elizabeth’s, time, and, yet, kept, good, quarter[271], between, themselves, and, would, confer, one, with, another, upon, the, business, and, the, one, of, them, said, that, to, be, a, secretary, in, the, declination, of, a, monarchy, was, a, ticklish, thing, and, that, he, did, not, affect, it, [272], the, other, straight, caught, up, those, words, and, discoursed, with, divers, of, his, friends, that, he, had, no, reason, to, desire, to, be, secretary, in, the, declination, of, a, monarchy, the, first, man, took, hold, of, it, and, found, means, it, was, told, the, queen, who, hearing, of, a, declination, of, a, monarchy, took, it, so, ill, as, she, would, never, after, hear, of, the, other’s, suit, there, is, a, cunning, which, we, in, england, call, “the, turning, of, the, cat, in, the, pan, ”, which, is, when, that, which, a, man, says, to, another, he, lays, it, as, if, another, had, said, it, to, him, and, to, say, truth, it, is, not, easy, when, such, a, matter, passed, between, two, to, make, it, appear, from, which, of, them, it, first, moved, and, began, it, is, a, way, that, some, men, have, to, glance, and, dart, at, others, by, justifying, themselves, by, negatives, as, to, say, “this, do, not, ”, as, tigellinus, did, towards, burrhus, “se, non, diversas, spes, sed, incolumitatem, imperatoris, simpliciter, spectare, ”[273], some, have, in, readiness, so, many, tales, and, stories, as, there, is, nothing, they, would, insinuate, but, they, can, wrap, it, into, a, tale, [274], which, serveth, both, to, keep, themselves, more, in, guard, and, to, make, others, carry, it, with, more, pleasure, it, is, a, good, point, of, cunning, for, a, man, to, shape, the, answer, he, would, have, in, his, own, words, and, propositions, for, it, makes, the, other, party, stick, the, less, it, is, strange, how, long, some, men, will, lie, in, wait, to, speak, somewhat, they, desire, to, say, and, how, far, about, they, will, fetch, [275], and, how, many, other, matters, they, will, beat, over, to, come, near, it, it, is, a, thing, of, great, patience, but, yet, of, much, use, sudden, bold, and, unexpected, question, doth, many, times, surprise, a, man, and, lay, him, open, like, to, him, that, having, changed, his, name, and, walking, in, paul’s, [276], another, suddenly, came, behind, him, and, called, him, by, his, true, name, whereat, straightways, he, looked, back, but, these, small, wares, and, petty, points, of, cunning, are, infinite, and, it, were, a, good, deed, to, make, a, list, of, them, for, that, nothing, doth, more, hurt, in, a, state, than, that, cunning, men, pass, for, wise, but, certainly, some, there, are, that, know, the, resorts[277], and, falls[278], of, business, that, cannot, sink, into, the, main, of, it, [279], like, a, house, that, hath, convenient, stairs, and, entries, but, never, a, fair, room, therefore, you, shall, see, them, find, out, pretty, looses[280], in, the, conclusion, but, are, noways, able, to, examine, or, debate, matters, and, yet, commonly, they, take, advantage, of, their, inability, and, would, be, thought, wits, of, direction, some, build, rather, upon, the, abusing, of, others, and, (as, we, now, say), putting, tricks, upon, them, than, upon, soundness, of, their, own, proceedings, but, solomon, saith, “prudens, advertit, ad, gressus, suos, stultus, divertit, ad, dolos, ”[281], an, ant, is, a, wise, creature, for, itself, but, it, is, a, shrewd[282], thing, in, an, orchard, or, garden, and, certainly, men, that, are, great, lovers, of, themselves, waste, the, public, divide, with, reason, between, self-love, and, society, and, be, so, true, to, thyself, as, thou, be, not, false, to, others, specially, to, thy, king, and, country, it, is, a, poor, centre, of, a, man’s, actions, himself, it, is, right, earth, for, that, only, stands, fast, upon, his, own, centre, [283], whereas, all, things, that, have, affinity, with, the, heavens, move, upon, the, centre, of, another, which, they, benefit, the, referring, of, all, to, a, man’s, self, is, more, tolerable, in, a, sovereign, prince, because, themselves, are, not, only, themselves, but, their, good, and, evil, is, at, the, peril, of, the, public, fortune, but, it, is, a, desperate, evil, in, a, servant, to, a, prince, or, a, citizen, in, a, republic, for, whatsoever, affairs, pass, such, a, man’s, hands, he, crooketh, them, to, his, own, ends, which, must, needs, be, often, eccentric, to, the, ends, of, his, master, or, state, therefore, let, princes, or, states, choose, such, servants, as, have, not, this, mark, except, they, mean, their, service, should, be, made, but, the, accessary, that, which, maketh, the, effect, more, pernicious, is, that, all, proportion, is, lost, it, were, disproportion, enough, for, the, servant’s, good, to, be, preferred, before, the, master’s, but, yet, it, is, a, greater, extreme, when, a, little, good, of, the, servant, shall, carry, things, against, a, great, good, of, the, master, and, yet, that, is, the, case, of, bad, officers, treasurers, ambassadors, generals, and, other, false, and, corrupt, servants, which, set, a, bias, upon, their, bowl, of, their, own, petty, ends, and, envies, to, the, overthrow, of, their, master’s, great, and, important, affairs, and, for, the, most, part, the, good, such, servants, receive, is, after, the, model, of, their, own, fortune, but, the, hurt, they, sell, for, that, good, is, after, the, model, of, their, master’s, fortune, and, certainly, it, is, the, nature, of, extreme, self-lovers, as, they, will, set, a, house, on, fire, an, it, were, but, to, roast, their, eggs, and, yet, these, men, many, times, hold, credit, with, their, masters, because, their, study, is, but, to, please, them, and, profit, themselves, and, for, either, respect, they, will, abandon, the, good, of, their, affairs, wisdom, for, a, man’s, self, is, in, many, branches, thereof, a, depraved, thing, it, is, the, wisdom, of, rats, that, will, be, sure, to, leave, a, house, somewhat, before, it, fall, it, is, the, wisdom, of, the, fox, that, thrusts, out, the, badger, who, digged, and, made, room, for, him, it, is, the, wisdom, of, crocodiles, that, shed, tears, when, they, would, devour, but, that, which, is, specially, to, be, noted, is, that, those, which, (as, cicero, says, of, pompey), are, “sui, amantes, sine, rivali, ”[284], are, many, times, unfortunate, and, whereas, they, have, all, their, times, sacrificed, to, themselves, they, become, in, the, end, themselves, sacrifices, to, the, inconstancy, of, fortune, whose, wings, they, thought, by, their, self-wisdom, to, have, pinioned, as, the, births, of, living, creatures, at, first, are, ill-shapen, so, are, all, innovations, which, are, the, births, of, time, yet, notwithstanding, as, those, that, first, bring, honor, into, their, family, are, commonly, more, worthy, than, most, that, succeed, so, the, first, precedent, (if, it, be, good), is, seldom, attained, by, imitation, for, ill, to, man’s, nature, as, it, stands, perverted, hath, a, natural, motion, strongest, in, continuance, but, good, as, a, forced, motion, strongest, at, first, surely, every, medicine[285], is, an, innovation, and, he, that, will, not, apply, new, remedies, must, expect, new, evils, for, time, is, the, greatest, innovator, and, if, time, of, course, alter, things, to, the, worse, and, wisdom, and, counsel, shall, not, alter, them, to, the, better, what, shall, be, the, end, it, is, true, that, what, is, settled, by, custom, though, it, be, not, good, yet, at, least, it, is, fit, and, those, things, which, have, long, gone, together, are, as, it, were, confederate, within, themselves, [286], whereas, new, things, piece, not, so, well, but, though, they, help, by, their, utility, yet, they, trouble, by, their, inconformity, besides, they, are, like, strangers, more, admired, and, less, favored, all, this, is, true, if, time, stood, still, which, contrariwise, moveth, so, round, that, a, froward, retention, of, custom, is, as, turbulent, a, thing, as, an, innovation, and, they, that, reverence, too, much, old, times, are, but, a, scorn, to, the, new, it, were, good, therefore, that, men, in, their, innovations, would, follow, the, example, of, time, itself, which, indeed, innovateth, greatly, but, quietly, and, by, degrees, scarce, to, be, perceived, for, otherwise, whatsoever, is, new, is, unlooked, for, and, ever, it, mends, some, and, pairs[287], other, and, he, that, is, holpen, takes, it, for, a, fortune, and, thanks, the, time, and, he, that, is, hurt, for, a, wrong, and, imputeth, it, to, the, author, it, is, good, also, not, to, try, experiments, in, states, except, the, necessity, be, urgent, or, the, utility, evident, and, well, to, beware, that, it, be, the, reformation, that, draweth, on, the, change, and, not, the, desire, of, change, that, pretendeth, the, reformation, and, lastly, that, the, novelty, though, it, be, not, rejected, yet, be, held, for, a, suspect, [288], and, as, the, scripture, saith, “that, we, make, a, stand, upon, the, ancient, way, and, then, look, about, us, and, discover, what, is, the, straight, and, right, way, and, so, to, walk, in, it, ”[289], affected, dispatch, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, things, to, business, that, can, be, it, is, like, that, which, the, physicians, call, predigestion, or, hasty, digestion, which, is, sure, to, fill, the, body, full, of, crudities, and, secret, seeds, of, diseases, therefore, measure, not, dispatch, by, the, times, of, sitting, but, by, the, advancement, of, the, business, and, as, in, races, it, is, not, the, large, stride, or, high, lift, that, makes, the, speed, so, in, business, the, keeping, close, to, the, matter, and, not, taking, of, it, too, much, at, once, procureth, dispatch, it, is, the, care, of, some, only, to, come, off, speedily, for, the, time, or, to, contrive, some, false, periods, of, business, because, they, may, seem, men, of, dispatch, but, it, is, one, thing, to, abbreviate, by, contracting, [290], another, by, cutting, off, and, business, so, handled, at, several, sittings, or, meetings, goeth, commonly, backward, and, forward, in, an, unsteady, manner, knew, a, wise, man[291], that, had, it, for, a, byword, when, he, saw, men, hasten, to, a, conclusion, “stay, a, little, that, we, may, make, an, end, the, sooner, ”, on, the, other, side, true, dispatch, is, a, rich, thing, for, time, is, the, measure, of, business, as, money, is, of, wares, and, business, is, bought, at, a, dear, hand, where, there, is, small, dispatch, the, spartans, and, spaniards, have, been, noted, to, be, of, small, dispatch, “mi, venga, la, muerte, de, spagna, ”, “let, my, death, come, from, spain, ”, for, then, it, will, be, sure, to, be, long, in, coming, give, good, hearing, to, those, that, give, the, first, information, in, business, and, rather, direct, them, in, the, beginning, than, interrupt, them, in, the, continuance, of, their, speeches, for, he, that, is, put, out, of, his, own, order, will, go, forward, and, backward, and, be, more, tedious, while, he, waits, upon, his, memory, than, he, could, have, been, if, he, had, gone, on, in, his, own, course, but, sometimes, it, is, seen, that, the, moderator, is, more, troublesome, than, the, actor, iterations, are, commonly, loss, of, time, but, there, is, no, such, gain, of, time, as, to, iterate, often, the, state, of, the, question, for, it, chaseth, away, many, a, frivolous, speech, as, it, is, coming, forth, long, and, curious, speeches, are, as, fit, for, dispatch, as, a, robe, or, mantle, with, a, long, train, is, for, a, race, prefaces, and, passages, [292], and, excusations, [293], and, other, speeches, of, reference, to, the, person, are, great, wastes, of, time, and, though, they, seem, to, proceed, of, modesty, they, are, bravery, [294], yet, beware, of, being, too, material, when, there, is, any, impediment, or, obstruction, in, men’s, wills, for, preoccupation, of, mind[295], ever, requireth, preface, of, speech, like, a, fomentation, to, make, the, unguent, enter, above, all, things, order, and, distribution, and, singling, out, of, parts, is, the, life, of, dispatch, so, as, the, distribution, be, not, too, subtile, for, he, that, doth, not, divide, will, never, enter, well, into, business, and, he, that, divideth, too, much, will, never, come, out, of, it, clearly, to, choose, time, is, to, save, time, and, an, unseasonable, motion, is, but, beating, the, air, there, be, three, parts, of, business, —the, preparation, the, debate, or, examination, and, the, perfection, whereof, if, you, look, for, dispatch, let, the, middle, only, be, the, work, of, many, and, the, first, and, last, the, work, of, few, the, proceeding, upon, somewhat, conceived, in, writing, doth, for, the, most, part, facilitate, dispatch, for, though, it, should, be, wholly, rejected, yet, that, negative, is, more, pregnant, of, direction, than, an, indefinite, as, ashes, are, more, generative, than, dust, it, hath, been, an, opinion, that, the, french, are, wiser, than, they, seem, and, the, spaniards, seem, wiser, than, they, are, but, howsoever, it, be, between, nations, certainly, it, is, so, between, man, and, man, for, as, the, apostle, saith, of, godliness, “having, a, show, of, godliness, but, denying, the, power, thereof, ”[296], so, certainly, there, are, in, points, of, wisdom, and, sufficiency, that, do, nothing, or, little, very, solemnly, —“magno, conatu, nugas, ”[297], it, is, a, ridiculous, thing, and, fit, for, a, satire, to, persons, of, judgment, to, see, what, shifts, these, formalists, have, and, what, prospectives, to, make, superficies, to, seem, body, that, hath, depth, and, bulk, some, are, so, close, and, reserved, as, they, will, not, show, their, wares, but, by, a, dark, light, and, seem, always, to, keep, back, somewhat, and, when, they, know, within, themselves, they, speak, of, that, they, do, not, well, know, would, nevertheless, seem, to, others, to, know, of, that, which, they, may, not, well, speak, some, help, themselves, with, countenance, and, gesture, and, are, wise, by, signs, as, cicero, saith, of, piso, that, when, he, answered, him, he, fetched, one, of, his, brows, up, to, his, forehead, and, bent, the, other, down, to, his, chin, “respondes, altero, ad, frontem, sublato, altero, ad, mentum, depresso, supercilio, crudelitatem, tibi, non, placere, ”[298], some, think, to, bear, it, by, speaking, a, great, word, and, being, peremptory, and, go, on, and, take, by, admittance, that, which, they, cannot, make, good, some, whatsoever, is, beyond, their, reach, will, seem, to, despise, or, make, light, of, it, as, impertinent, or, curious, and, so, would, have, their, ignorance, seem, judgment, some, are, never, without, a, difference, and, commonly, by, amusing, men, with, a, subtilty, blanch, the, matter, of, whom, gellius, saith, “hominem, delirum, qui, verborum, minutiis, rerum, frangit, pondera, ”[299], of, which, kind, also, plato, in, his, protagoras, bringeth, in, prodicus, in, scorn, and, maketh, him, make, a, speech, that, consisteth, of, distinctions, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, [300], generally, such, men, in, all, deliberations, find, ease, to, be[301], of, the, negative, side, and, affect, a, credit, to, object, and, foretell, difficulties, for, when, propositions, are, denied, there, is, an, end, of, them, but, if, they, be, allowed, it, requireth, a, new, work, which, false, point, of, wisdom, is, the, bane, of, business, to, conclude, there, is, no, decaying, merchant, or, inward, beggar, [302], hath, so, many, tricks, to, uphold, the, credit, of, their, wealth, as, these, empty, persons, have, to, maintain, the, credit, of, their, sufficiency, seeming, wise, men, may, make, shift, to, get, opinion, but, let, no, man, choose, them, for, employment, for, certainly, you, were, better, take, for, business, a, man, somewhat, absurd, than, over-formal, it, had, been, hard, for, him, that, spake, it, to, have, put, more, truth, and, untruth, together, in, few, words, than, in, that, speech, “whosoever, is, delighted, in, solitude, is, either, a, wild, beast, or, a, god, ”[303], for, it, is, most, true, that, a, natural, and, secret, hatred, and, aversion, towards, society, in, any, man, hath, somewhat, of, the, savage, beast, but, it, is, most, untrue, that, it, should, have, any, character, at, all, of, the, divine, nature, except, it, proceed, not, out, of, a, pleasure, in, solitude, but, out, of, a, love, and, desire, to, sequester, a, man’s, self, for, a, higher, conversation, such, as, is, found, to, have, been, falsely, and, feignedly, in, some, of, the, heathen, as, epimenides, [304], the, candian, numa, the, roman, empedocles, the, sicilian, and, apollonius, of, tyana, and, truly, and, really, in, divers, of, the, ancient, hermits, and, holy, fathers, of, the, church, but, little, do, men, perceive, what, solitude, is, and, how, far, it, extendeth, for, a, crowd, is, not, company, and, faces, are, but, a, gallery, of, pictures, and, talk, but, a, tinkling, cymbal, where, there, is, no, love, the, latin, adage, meeteth, with, it, a, little, “magna, civitas, magna, solitudo, ”[305], because, in, a, great, town, friends, are, scattered, so, that, there, is, not, that, fellowship, for, the, most, part, which, is, in, less, neighborhoods, but, we, may, go, further, and, affirm, most, truly, that, it, is, a, mere, and, miserable, solitude, to, want, true, friends, without, which, the, world, is, but, a, wilderness, and, even, in, this, sense, also, of, solitude, whosoever, in, the, frame, of, his, nature, and, affections, is, unfit, for, friendship, he, taketh, it, of, the, beasts, and, not, from, humanity, principal, fruit, of, friendship, is, the, ease, and, discharge, of, the, fulness, and, swellings, of, the, heart, which, passions, of, all, kinds, do, cause, and, induce, we, know, diseases, of, stoppings, and, suffocations, are, the, most, dangerous, in, the, body, and, it, is, not, much, otherwise, in, the, mind, you, may, take, sarza[306], to, open, the, liver, steel, to, open, the, spleen, flower, of, sulphur, for, the, lungs, castoreum[307], for, the, brain, but, no, receipt, openeth, the, heart, but, a, true, friend, to, whom, you, may, impart, griefs, joys, fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and, whatsoever, lieth, upon, the, heart, to, oppress, it, in, a, kind, of, civil, shrift, or, confession, it, is, a, strange, thing, to, observe, how, high, a, rate, great, kings, and, monarchs, do, set, upon, this, fruit, of, friendship, whereof, we, speak, so, great, as, they, purchase, it, many, times, at, the, hazard, of, their, own, safety, and, greatness, for, princes, in, regard, of, the, distance, of, their, fortune, from, that, of, their, subjects, and, servants, cannot, gather, this, fruit, except, (to, make, themselves, capable, thereof), they, raise, some, persons, to, be, as, it, were, companions, and, almost, equals, to, themselves, which, many, times, sorteth, to, inconvenience, the, modern, languages, give, unto, such, persons, the, name, of, favorites, or, privadoes, as, if, it, were, matter, of, grace, or, conversation, but, the, roman, name, attaineth, the, true, use, and, cause, thereof, naming, them, “participes, curarum, ”[308], for, it, is, that, which, tieth, the, knot, and, we, see, plainly, that, this, hath, been, done, not, by, weak, and, passionate, princes, only, but, by, the, wisest, and, most, politic, that, ever, reigned, who, have, oftentimes, joined, to, themselves, some, of, their, servants, whom, both, themselves, have, called, friends, and, allowed, others, likewise, to, call, them, in, the, same, manner, using, the, word, which, is, received, between, private, men, sylla, when, he, commanded, rome, raised, pompey, (after, surnamed, the, great), to, that, height, that, pompey, vaunted, himself, for, sylla’s, overmatch, for, when, he, had, carried, the, consulship, for, a, friend, of, his, against, the, pursuit, of, sylla, and, that, sylla, did, a, little, resent, thereat, and, began, to, speak, great, pompey, turned, upon, him, again, and, in, effect, bade, him, be, quiet, for, that, more, men, adored, the, sun, rising, than, the, sun, setting, [309], with, julius, cæsar, decimus, brutus, had, obtained, that, interest, as, he, set, him, down, in, his, testament, for, heir, in, remainder, after, his, nephew, and, this, was, the, man, that, had, power, with, him, to, draw, him, forth, to, his, death, for, when, cæsar, would, have, discharged, the, senate, in, regard, of, some, ill, presages, and, specially, a, dream, of, calphurnia, this, man, lifted, him, gently, by, the, arm, out, of, his, chair, telling, him, he, hoped, he, would, not, dismiss, the, senate, till, his, wife, had, dreamt, a, better, dream, [310], and, it, seemeth, his, favor, was, so, great, as, antonius, in, a, letter, which, is, recited, verbatim, in, one, of, cicero’s, philippics, calleth, him, _venefica_, “witch, ”, as, if, he, had, enchanted, cæsar, [311], augustus, raised, agrippa, (though, of, mean, birth), to, that, height, as, when, he, consulted, with, mæcenas, about, the, marriage, of, his, daughter, julia, mæcenas, took, the, liberty, to, tell, him, that, he, must, either, marry, his, daughter, to, agrippa, or, take, away, his, life, there, was, no, third, way, he, had, made, him, so, great, with, tiberius, cæsar, sejanus, had, ascended, to, that, height, as, they, two, were, termed, and, reckoned, as, a, pair, of, friends, tiberius, in, a, letter, to, him, saith, “hæc, pro, amicitiâ, nostrâ, non, occultavi, ”[312], and, the, whole, senate, dedicated, an, altar, to, friendship, as, to, a, goddess, in, respect, of, the, great, dearness, of, friendship, between, them, two, the, like, or, more, was, between, septimius, severus, and, plautianus, for, he, forced, his, eldest, son, to, marry, the, daughter, of, plautianus, and, would, often, maintain, plautianus, in, doing, affronts, to, his, son, and, did, write, also, in, a, letter, to, the, senate, by, these, words, love, the, man, so, well, as, wish, he, may, over-live, me, ”[313], now, if, these, princes, had, been, as, a, trajan, or, a, marcus, aurelius, a, man, might, have, thought, that, this, had, proceeded, of, an, abundant, goodness, of, nature, but, being, men, so, wise, [314], of, such, strength, and, severity, of, mind, and, so, extreme, lovers, of, themselves, as, all, these, were, it, proveth, most, plainly, that, they, found, their, own, felicity, (though, as, great, as, ever, happened, to, mortal, men), but, as, an, half-piece, except, they, might, have, a, friend, to, make, it, entire, and, yet, which, is, more, they, were, princes, that, had, wives, sons, nephews, and, yet, all, these, could, not, supply, the, comfort, of, friendship, it, is, not, to, be, forgotten, what, comineus[315], observeth, of, his, first, master, duke, charles, the, hardy, [316], namely, that, he, would, communicate, his, secrets, with, none, and, least, of, all, those, secrets, which, troubled, him, most, whereupon, he, goeth, on, and, saith, that, towards, his, latter, time, that, closeness, did, impair, and, a, little, perish, his, understanding, surely, comineus, might, have, made, the, same, judgment, also, if, it, had, pleased, him, of, his, second, master, louis, the, eleventh, whose, closeness, was, indeed, his, tormentor, the, parable, of, pythagoras, is, dark, but, true, “cor, ne, edito, ”, “eat, not, the, heart, ”[317], certainly, if, a, man, would, give, it, a, hard, phrase, those, that, want, friends, to, open, themselves, unto, are, cannibals, of, their, own, hearts, but, one, thing, is, most, admirable, (wherewith, will, conclude, this, first, fruit, of, friendship), which, is, that, this, communicating, of, a, man’s, self, to, his, friend, works, two, contrary, effects, for, it, redoubleth, joys, and, cutteth, griefs, in, halves, for, there, is, no, man, that, imparteth, his, joys, to, his, friend, but, he, joyeth, the, more, and, no, man, that, imparteth, his, griefs, to, his, friend, but, he, grieveth, the, less, so, that, it, is, in, truth, of, operation, upon, a, man’s, mind, of, like, virtue, as, the, alchemists, used, to, attribute, to, their, stone, for, man’s, body, that, it, worketh, all, contrary, effects, but, still, to, the, good, and, benefit, of, nature, but, yet, without, praying, in, aid, of, alchemists, there, is, a, manifest, image, of, this, in, the, ordinary, course, of, nature, for, in, bodies, union, strengtheneth, and, cherisheth, any, natural, action, and, on, the, other, side, weakeneth, and, dulleth, any, violent, impression, and, even, so, it, is, of, minds, the, second, fruit, of, friendship, is, healthful, and, sovereign, for, the, understanding, as, the, first, is, for, the, affections, for, friendship, maketh, indeed, a, fair, day, in, the, affections, from, storm, and, tempests, but, it, maketh, daylight, in, the, understanding, out, of, darkness, and, confusion, of, thoughts, neither, is, this, to, be, understood, only, of, faithful, counsel, which, a, man, receiveth, from, his, friend, but, before, you, come, to, that, certain, it, is, that, whosoever, hath, his, mind, fraught, with, many, thoughts, his, wits, and, understanding, do, clarify, and, break, up, in, the, communicating, and, discoursing, with, another, he, tosseth, his, thoughts, more, easily, he, marshalleth, them, more, orderly, he, seeth, how, they, look, when, they, are, turned, into, words, finally, he, waxeth, wiser, than, himself, and, that, more, by, an, hour’s, discourse, than, by, a, day’s, meditation, it, was, well, said, by, themistocles, to, the, king, of, persia, “that, speech, was, like, cloth, of, arras, [318], opened, and, put, abroad, whereby, the, imagery, doth, appear, in, figure, whereas, in, thoughts, they, lie, but, as, in, packs, ”[319], neither, is, this, second, fruit, of, friendship, in, opening, the, understanding, restrained, only, to, such, friends, as, are, able, to, give, a, man, counsel, (they, indeed, are, best), but, even, without, that, a, man, learneth, of, himself, and, bringeth, his, own, thoughts, to, light, and, whetteth, his, wits, as, against, a, stone, which, itself, cuts, not, in, a, word, a, man, were, better, relate, himself, to, a, statue, or, picture, than, to, suffer, his, thoughts, to, pass, in, smother, add, now, to, make, this, second, fruit, of, friendship, complete, that, other, point, which, lieth, more, open, and, falleth, within, vulgar, observation, which, is, faithful, counsel, from, a, friend, heraclitus, saith, well, in, one, of, his, enigmas, “dry, light, is, ever, the, best, ”[320], and, certain, it, is, that, the, light, that, a, man, receiveth, by, counsel, from, another, is, drier, and, purer, than, that, which, cometh, from, his, own, understanding, and, judgment, which, is, ever, infused, and, drenched, in, his, affections, and, customs, so, as, there, is, as, much, difference, between, the, counsel, that, a, friend, giveth, and, that, a, man, giveth, himself, as, there, is, between, the, counsel, of, a, friend, and, of, a, flatterer, for, there, is, no, such, flatterer, as, is, a, man’s, self, and, there, is, no, such, remedy, against, flattery, of, a, man’s, self, as, the, liberty, of, a, friend, counsel, is, of, two, sorts, —the, one, concerning, manners, the, other, concerning, business, for, the, first, the, best, preservative, to, keep, the, mind, in, health, is, the, faithful, admonition, of, a, friend, the, calling, of, a, man’s, self, to, a, strict, account, is, a, medicine, sometimes, too, piercing, and, corrosive, reading, good, books, of, morality, is, a, little, flat, and, dead, observing, our, faults, in, others, is, sometimes, improper, for, our, case, but, the, best, receipt, (best, say, to, work, and, best, to, take), is, the, admonition, of, a, friend, it, is, a, strange, thing, to, behold, what, gross, errors, and, extreme, absurdities, many, (especially, of, the, greater, sort), do, commit, for, want, of, a, friend, to, tell, them, of, them, to, the, great, damage, both, of, their, fame, and, fortune, for, as, st, james, saith, they, are, as, men, “that, look, sometimes, into, a, glass, and, presently, forget, their, own, shape, and, favor, ”[321], as, for, business, a, man, may, think, if, he, will, that, two, eyes, see, no, more, than, one, or, that, a, gamester, seeth, always, more, than, a, looker-on, or, that, a, man, in, anger, is, as, wise, as, he, that, has, said, over, the, four, and, twenty, letters, [322], or, that, a, musket, may, be, shot, off, as, well, upon, the, arm, as, upon, a, rest, [323], and, such, other, fond, and, high, imaginations, to, think, himself, all, in, all, but, when, all, is, done, the, help, of, good, counsel, is, that, which, setteth, business, straight, and, if, any, man, think, that, he, will, take, counsel, but, it, shall, be, by, pieces, asking, counsel, in, one, business, of, one, man, and, in, another, business, of, another, man, it, is, well, (that, is, to, say, better, perhaps, than, if, he, asked, none, at, all), but, he, runneth, two, dangers, —one, that, he, shall, not, be, faithfully, counselled, for, it, is, a, rare, thing, except, it, be, from, a, perfect, and, entire, friend, to, have, counsel, given, but, such, as, shall, be, bowed, and, crooked, to, some, ends, which, he, hath, that, giveth, it, the, other, that, he, shall, have, counsel, given, hurtful, and, unsafe, (though, with, good, meaning), and, mixed, partly, of, mischief, and, partly, of, remedy, even, as, if, you, would, call, a, physician, that, is, thought, good, for, the, cure, of, the, disease, you, complain, of, but, is, unacquainted, with, your, body, and, therefore, may, put, you, in, a, way, for, a, present, cure, but, overthroweth, your, health, in, some, other, kind, and, so, cure, the, disease, and, kill, the, patient, but, a, friend, that, is, wholly, acquainted, with, a, man’s, estate, will, beware, by, furthering, any, present, business, how, he, dasheth, upon, other, inconvenience, and, therefore, rest, not, upon, scattered, counsels, they, will, rather, distract, and, mislead, than, settle, and, direct, after, these, two, noble, fruits, of, friendship, (peace, in, the, affections, and, support, of, the, judgment), followeth, the, last, fruit, which, is, like, the, pomegranate, full, of, many, kernels, mean, aid, and, bearing, a, part, in, all, actions, and, occasions, here, the, best, way, to, represent, to, life, the, manifold, use, of, friendship, is, to, cast, and, see, how, many, things, there, are, which, a, man, cannot, do, himself, and, then, it, will, appear, that, it, was, a, sparing, speech, of, the, ancients, to, say, “that, a, friend, is, another, himself, ”, for, that, a, friend, is, far, more, than, himself, men, have, their, time, and, die, many, times, in, desire, of, some, things, which, they, principally, take, to, heart, the, bestowing, of, a, child, the, finishing, of, a, work, or, the, like, if, a, man, have, a, true, friend, he, may, rest, almost, secure, that, the, care, of, those, things, will, continue, after, him, so, that, a, man, hath, as, it, were, two, lives, in, his, desires, man, hath, a, body, and, that, body, is, confined, to, a, place, but, where, friendship, is, all, offices, of, life, are, as, it, were, granted, to, him, and, his, deputy, for, he, may, exercise, them, by, his, friend, how, many, things, are, there, which, a, man, cannot, with, any, face, or, comeliness, say, or, do, himself, man, can, scarce, allege, his, own, merits, with, modesty, much, less, extol, them, a, man, cannot, sometimes, brook, to, supplicate, or, beg, and, a, number, of, the, like, but, all, these, things, are, graceful, in, a, friend’s, mouth, which, are, blushing, in, a, man’s, own, so, again, a, man’s, person, hath, many, proper, relations, which, he, cannot, put, off, man, cannot, speak, to, his, son, but, as, a, father, to, his, wife, but, as, a, husband, to, his, enemy, but, upon, terms, whereas, a, friend, may, speak, as, the, case, requires, and, not, as, it, sorteth, with, the, person, but, to, enumerate, these, things, were, endless, have, given, the, rule, where, a, man, cannot, fitly, play, his, own, part, if, he, have, not, a, friend, he, may, quit, the, stage, riches, are, for, spending, and, spending, for, honor, and, good, actions, therefore, extraordinary, expense, must, be, limited, by, the, worth, of, the, occasion, for, voluntary, undoing, may, be, as, well, for, a, man’s, country, as, for, the, kingdom, of, heaven, but, ordinary, expense, ought, to, be, limited, by, a, man’s, estate, and, governed, with, such, regard, as, it, be, within, his, compass, and, not, subject, to, deceit, and, abuse, of, servants, and, ordered, to, the, best, show, that, the, bills, may, be, less, than, the, estimation, abroad, certainly, if, a, man, will, keep, but, of, even, hand, his, ordinary, expenses, ought, to, be, but, to, the, half, of, his, receipts, and, if, he, think, to, wax, rich, but, to, the, third, part, it, is, no, baseness, for, the, greatest, to, descend, and, look, into, their, own, estate, some, forbear, it, not, upon, negligence, alone, but, doubting, to, bring, themselves, into, melancholy, in, respect, they, shall, find, it, broken, but, wounds, cannot, be, cured, without, searching, he, that, cannot, look, into, his, own, estate, at, all, had, need, both, choose, well, those, whom, he, employeth, and, change, them, often, for, new, are, more, timorous, and, less, subtle, he, that, can, look, into, his, estate, but, seldom, it, behooveth, him, to, turn, all, to, certainties, man, had, need, if, he, be, plentiful, in, some, kind, of, expense, to, be, as, saving, again, in, some, other, as, if, he, be, plentiful, in, diet, to, be, saving, in, apparel, if, he, be, plentiful, in, the, hall, to, be, saving, in, the, stable, and, the, like, for, he, that, is, plentiful, in, expenses, of, all, kinds, will, hardly, be, preserved, from, decay, in, clearing[324], of, a, man’s, estate, he, may, as, well, hurt, himself, in, being, too, sudden, as, in, letting, it, run, on, too, long, for, hasty, selling, is, commonly, as, disadvantageable, as, interest, besides, he, that, clears, at, once, will, relapse, for, finding, himself, out, of, straits, he, will, revert, to, his, customs, but, he, that, cleareth, by, degrees, induceth, a, habit, of, frugality, and, gaineth, as, well, upon, his, mind, as, upon, his, estate, certainly, who, hath, a, state, to, repair, may, not, despise, small, things, and, commonly, it, is, less, dishonorable, to, abridge, petty, charges, than, to, stoop, to, petty, gettings, man, ought, warily, to, begin, charges, which, once, begun, will, continue, but, in, matters, that, return, not, he, may, be, more, magnificent, the, speech, of, themistocles, the, athenian, which, was, haughty, and, arrogant, in, taking, so, much, to, himself, had, been, a, grave, and, wise, observation, and, censure, applied, at, large, to, others, desired, at, a, feast, to, touch, a, lute, he, said, “he, could, not, fiddle, but, yet, he, could, make, a, small, town, a, great, city, ”[325], these, words, (holpen, a, little, with, a, metaphor), may, express, two, different, abilities, in, those, that, deal, in, business, of, estate, for, if, a, true, survey, be, taken, of, counsellors, and, statesmen, there, may, be, found, (though, rarely), those, which, can, make, a, small, state, great, and, yet, cannot, fiddle, as, on, the, other, side, there, will, be, found, a, great, many, that, can, fiddle, very, cunningly, but, yet, are, so, far, from, being, able, to, make, a, small, state, great, as, their, gift, lieth, the, other, way, —to, bring, a, great, and, flourishing, estate, to, ruin, and, decay, and, certainly, those, degenerate, arts, and, shifts, whereby, many, counsellors, and, governors, gain, both, favor, with, their, masters, and, estimation, with, the, vulgar, deserve, no, better, name, than, fiddling, being, things, rather, pleasing, for, the, time, and, graceful, to, themselves, only, than, tending, to, the, weal, and, advancement, of, the, state, which, they, serve, there, are, also, (no, doubt), counsellors, and, governors, which, may, be, held, sufficient, “negotiis, pares, ”[326], able, to, manage, affairs, and, to, keep, them, from, precipices, and, manifest, inconveniences, which, nevertheless, are, far, from, the, ability, to, raise, and, amplify, an, estate, in, power, means, and, fortune, but, be, the, workmen, what, they, may, be, let, us, speak, of, the, work, that, is, the, true, greatness, of, kingdoms, and, estates, and, the, means, thereof, an, argument, fit, for, great, and, mighty, princes, to, have, in, their, hand, to, the, end, that, neither, by, overmeasuring, their, forces, they, lose, themselves, in, vain, enterprises, nor, on, the, other, side, by, undervaluing, them, they, descend, to, fearful, and, pusillanimous, counsels, the, greatness, of, an, estate, in, bulk, and, territory, doth, fall, under, measure, and, the, greatness, of, finances, and, revenue, doth, fall, under, computation, the, population, may, appear, by, musters, and, the, number, and, greatness, of, cities, and, towns, by, cards, and, maps, but, yet, there, is, not, anything, amongst, civil, affairs, more, subject, to, error, than, the, right, valuation, and, true, judgment, concerning, the, power, and, forces, of, an, estate, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, compared, not, to, any, great, kernel, or, nut, but, to, a, grain, of, mustard-seed, [327], which, is, one, of, the, least, grains, but, hath, in, it, a, property, and, spirit, hastily, to, get, up, and, spread, so, are, there, states, great, in, territory, and, yet, not, apt, to, enlarge, or, command, and, some, that, have, but, a, small, dimension, of, stem, and, yet, apt, to, be, the, foundations, of, great, monarchies, walled, towns, stored, arsenals, and, armories, goodly, races, of, horse, chariots, of, war, elephants, ordnance, artillery, and, the, like, all, this, is, but, a, sheep, in, a, lion’s, skin, except, the, breed, and, disposition, of, the, people, be, stout, and, warlike, nay, number, itself, in, armies, importeth, not, much, where, the, people, is, of, weak, courage, for, as, virgil, saith, “it, never, troubles, a, wolf, how, many, the, sheep, be, ”[328], the, army, of, the, persians, in, the, plains, of, arbela, was, such, a, vast, sea, of, people, as, it, did, somewhat, astonish, the, commanders, in, alexander’s, army, who, came, to, him, therefore, and, wished, him, to, set, upon, them, by, night, but, he, answered, “he, would, not, pilfer, the, victory, ”, and, the, defeat, was, easy, [329]—when, tigranes, [330], the, armenian, being, encamped, upon, a, hill, with, four, hundred, thousand, men, discovered, the, army, of, the, romans, being, not, above, fourteen, thousand, marching, towards, him, he, made, himself, merry, with, it, and, said, “yonder, men, are, too, many, for, an, ambassage, and, too, few, for, a, fight, ”, but, before, the, sun, set, he, found, them, enow, to, give, him, the, chase, with, infinite, slaughter, many, are, the, examples, of, the, great, odds, between, number, and, courage, so, that, a, man, may, truly, make, a, judgment, that, the, principal, point, of, greatness, in, any, state, is, to, have, a, race, of, military, men, neither, is, money, the, sinews, of, war, (as, it, is, trivially, said), where, the, sinews, of, men’s, arms, in, base, and, effeminate, people, are, failing, for, solon, said, well, to, crœsus, (when, in, ostentation, he, showed, him, his, gold), “sir, if, any, other, come, that, hath, better, iron, than, you, he, will, be, master, of, all, this, gold, ”, therefore, let, any, prince, or, state, think, soberly, of, his, forces, except, his, militia, of, natives, be, of, good, and, valiant, soldiers, and, let, princes, on, the, other, side, that, have, subjects, of, martial, disposition, know, their, own, strength, unless, they, be, otherwise, wanting, unto, themselves, as, for, mercenary, forces, (which, is, the, help, in, this, case), all, examples, show, that, whatsoever, estate, or, prince, doth, rest, upon, them, he, may, spread, his, feathers, for, a, time, but, he, will, mew, them, soon, after, the, blessing, of, judah, and, issachar[331], will, never, meet, that, the, same, people, or, nation, should, be, both, the, lion’s, whelp, and, the, ass, between, burdens, neither, will, it, be, that, a, people, overlaid, with, taxes, should, ever, become, valiant, and, martial, it, is, true, that, taxes, levied, by, consent, of, the, estate, do, abate, men’s, courage, less, as, it, hath, been, seen, notably, in, the, excises, of, the, low, countries, and, in, some, degree, in, the, subsidies[332], of, england, for, you, must, note, that, we, speak, now, of, the, heart, and, not, of, the, purse, so, that, although, the, same, tribute, and, tax, laid, by, consent, or, by, imposing, be, all, one, to, the, purse, yet, it, works, diversely, upon, the, courage, so, that, you, may, conclude, that, no, people, overcharged, with, tribute, is, fit, for, empire, let, states, that, aim, at, greatness, take, heed, how, their, nobility, and, gentlemen, do, multiply, too, fast, for, that, maketh, the, common, subject, grow, to, be, a, peasant, and, base, swain, driven, out, of, heart, and, in, effect, but, the, gentleman’s, laborer, even, as, you, may, see, in, coppice, woods, if, you, leave, your, staddles[333], too, thick, you, shall, never, have, clean, underwood, but, shrubs, and, bushes, so, in, countries, if, the, gentlemen, be, too, many, the, commons, will, be, base, and, you, will, bring, it, to, that, that, not, the, hundred, poll, will, be, fit, for, a, helmet, especially, as, to, the, infantry, which, is, the, nerve, of, an, army, and, so, there, will, be, great, population, and, little, strength, this, which, speak, of, hath, been, nowhere, better, seen, than, by, comparing, of, england, and, france, whereof, england, though, far, less, in, territory, and, population, hath, been, nevertheless, an, overmatch, in, regard, the, middle, people, of, england, make, good, soldiers, which, the, peasants, of, france, do, not, and, herein, the, device, of, king, henry, the, seventh, (whereof, have, spoken, largely, in, the, history, of, his, life), was, profound, and, admirable, in, making, farms, and, houses, of, husbandry, of, a, standard, that, is, maintained, with, such, a, proportion, of, land, unto, them, as, may, breed, a, subject, to, live, in, convenient, plenty, and, no, servile, condition, and, to, keep, the, plough, in, the, hands, of, the, owners, and, not, mere, hirelings, and, thus, indeed, you, shall, attain, to, virgil’s, character, which, he, gives, to, ancient, italy, —, “terra, potens, armis, atque, ubere, glebæ, ”[334], neither, is, that, state, (which, for, anything, know, is, almost, peculiar, to, england, and, hardly, to, be, found, anywhere, else, except, it, be, perhaps, in, poland), to, be, passed, over, mean, the, state, of, free, servants, and, attendants, upon, noblemen, and, gentlemen, which, are, noways, inferior, unto, the, yeomanry, for, arms, and, therefore, out, of, all, question, the, splendor, and, magnificence, and, great, retinues, and, hospitality, of, noblemen, and, gentlemen, received, into, custom, do, much, conduce, unto, martial, greatness, whereas, contrariwise, the, close, and, reserved, living, of, noblemen, and, gentlemen, causeth, a, penury, of, military, forces, by, all, means, it, is, to, be, procured, that, the, trunk, of, nebuchadnezzar’s, tree, of, monarchy[335], be, great, enough, to, bear, the, branches, and, the, boughs, that, is, that, the, natural, subjects, of, the, crown, or, state, bear, a, sufficient, proportion, to, the, stranger, subjects, that, they, govern, therefore, all, states, that, are, liberal, of, naturalization, towards, strangers, are, fit, for, empire, for, to, think, that, a, handful, of, people, can, with, the, greatest, courage, and, policy, in, the, world, embrace, too, large, extent, of, dominion, it, may, hold, for, a, time, but, it, will, fail, suddenly, the, spartans, were, a, nice, people, in, point, of, naturalization, whereby, while, they, kept, their, compass, they, stood, firm, but, when, they, did, spread, and, their, boughs, were, becoming, too, great, for, their, stem, they, became, a, windfall, upon, the, sudden, never, any, state, was, in, this, point, so, open, to, receive, strangers, into, their, body, as, were, the, romans, therefore, it, sorted, with, them, accordingly, for, they, grew, to, the, greatest, monarchy, their, manner, was, to, grant, naturalization, (which, they, called, “jus, civitatis”), [336], and, to, grant, it, in, the, highest, degree, that, is, not, only, “jus, commercii, ”[337], “jus, connubii, ”[338], “jus, hæreditatis, ”[339], but, also, “jus, suffragii, ”[340], and, “jus, honorum, ”[341], and, this, not, to, singular, persons, alone, but, likewise, to, whole, families, yea, to, cities, and, sometimes, to, nations, add, to, this, their, custom, of, plantation, of, colonies, whereby, the, roman, plant, was, removed, into, the, soil, of, other, nations, and, putting, both, constitutions, together, you, will, say, that, it, was, not, the, romans, that, spread, upon, the, world, but, it, was, the, world, that, spread, upon, the, romans, and, that, was, the, sure, way, of, greatness, have, marvelled, sometimes, at, spain, how, they, clasp, and, contain, so, large, dominions, with, so, few, natural, spaniards, [342], but, sure, the, whole, compass, of, spain, is, a, very, great, body, of, a, tree, far, above, rome, and, sparta, at, the, first, and, besides, though, they, have, not, had, that, usage, to, naturalize, liberally, yet, they, have, that, which, is, next, to, it, that, is, to, employ, almost, indifferently, all, nations, in, their, militia, of, ordinary, soldiers, yea, and, sometimes, in, their, highest, commands, nay, it, seemeth, at, this, instant, they, are, sensible, of, this, want, of, natives, as, by, the, pragmatical, sanction, [343], now, published, appeareth, it, is, certain, that, sedentary, and, within-door, arts, and, delicate, manufactures, (that, require, rather, the, finger, than, the, arm), have, in, their, nature, a, contrariety, to, a, military, disposition, and, generally, all, warlike, people, are, a, little, idle, and, love, danger, better, than, travail, neither, must, they, be, too, much, broken, of, it, if, they, shall, be, preserved, in, vigor, therefore, it, was, great, advantage, in, the, ancient, states, of, sparta, athens, rome, and, others, that, they, had, the, use, of, slaves, which, commonly, did, rid, those, manufactures, but, that, is, abolished, in, greatest, part, by, the, christian, law, that, which, cometh, nearest, to, it, is, to, leave, those, arts, chiefly, to, strangers, (which, for, that, purpose, are, the, more, easily, to, be, received), and, to, contain, the, principal, bulk, of, the, vulgar, natives, within, those, three, kinds, tillers, of, the, ground, free, servants, and, handicraftsmen, of, strong, and, manly, arts, as, smiths, masons, carpenters, &c, not, reckoning, professed, soldiers, but, above, all, for, empire, and, greatness, it, importeth, most, that, a, nation, do, profess, arms, as, their, principal, honor, study, and, occupation, for, the, things, which, we, formerly, have, spoken, of, are, but, habilitations[344], towards, arms, and, what, is, habilitation, without, intention, and, act, romulus, after, his, death, (as, they, report, or, feign), sent, a, present, to, the, romans, that, above, all, they, should, intend[345], arms, and, then, they, should, prove, the, greatest, empire, of, the, world, the, fabric, of, the, state, of, sparta, was, wholly, (though, not, wisely), framed, and, composed, to, that, scope, and, end, the, persians, and, macedonians, had, it, for, a, flash, [346], the, gauls, germans, goths, saxons, normans, and, others, had, it, for, a, time, the, turks, have, it, at, this, day, though, in, great, declination, of, christian, europe, they, that, have, it, are, in, effect, only, the, spaniards, but, it, is, so, plain, that, every, man, profiteth, in, that, he, most, intendeth, that, it, needeth, not, to, be, stood, upon, it, is, enough, to, point, at, it, that, no, nation, which, doth, not, directly, profess, arms, may, look, to, have, greatness, fall, into, their, mouths, and, on, the, other, side, it, is, a, most, certain, oracle, of, time, that, those, states, that, continue, long, in, that, profession, (as, the, romans, and, turks, principally, have, done), do, wonders, and, those, that, have, professed, arms, but, for, an, age, have, notwithstanding, commonly, attained, that, greatness, in, that, age, which, maintained, them, long, after, when, their, profession, and, exercise, of, arms, had, grown, to, decay, incident, to, this, point, is, for, a, state, to, have, those, laws, or, customs, which, may, reach, forth, unto, them, just, occasions, (as, may, be, pretended), of, war, for, there, is, that, justice, imprinted, in, the, nature, of, men, that, they, enter, not, upon, wars, (whereof, so, many, calamities, do, ensue), but, upon, some, at, the, least, specious, grounds, and, quarrels, the, turk, hath, at, hand, for, cause, of, war, the, propagation, of, his, law, or, sect, a, quarrel, that, he, may, always, command, the, romans, though, they, esteemed, the, extending, the, limits, of, their, empire, to, be, great, honor, to, their, generals, when, it, was, done, yet, they, never, rested, upon, that, alone, to, begin, a, war, first, therefore, let, nations, that, pretend, to, greatness, have, this, that, they, be, sensible, of, wrongs, either, upon, borderers, merchants, or, politic, ministers, and, that, they, sit, not, too, long, upon, a, provocation, secondly, let, them, be, pressed, [347], and, ready, to, give, aids, and, succors, to, their, confederates, as, it, ever, was, with, the, romans, insomuch, as, if, the, confederate, had, leagues, defensive, with, divers, other, states, and, upon, invasion, offered, did, implore, their, aids, severally, yet, the, romans, would, ever, be, the, foremost, and, leave, it, to, none, other, to, have, the, honor, as, for, the, wars, which, were, anciently, made, on, the, behalf, of, a, kind, of, party, or, tacit, conformity, of, estate, do, not, see, how, they, may, be, well, justified, as, when, the, romans, made, a, war, for, the, liberty, of, græcia, or, when, the, lacedæmonians, and, athenians, made, wars, to, set, up, or, pull, down, democracies, and, oligarchies, or, when, wars, were, made, by, foreigners, under, the, pretence, of, justice, or, protection, to, deliver, the, subjects, of, others, from, tyranny, and, oppression, and, the, like, let, it, suffice, that, no, estate, expect, to, be, great, that, is, not, awake, upon, any, just, occasion, of, arming, nobody, can, be, healthful, without, exercise, neither, natural, body, nor, politic, and, certainly, to, a, kingdom, or, estate, a, just, and, honorable, war, is, the, true, exercise, civil, war, indeed, is, like, the, heat, of, a, fever, but, a, foreign, war, is, like, the, heat, of, exercise, and, serveth, to, keep, the, body, in, health, for, in, a, slothful, peace, both, courages, will, effeminate, and, manners, corrupt, but, howsoever, it, be, for, happiness, without, all, question, for, greatness, it, maketh, to, be, still, for, the, most, part, in, arms, and, the, strength, of, a, veteran, army, (though, it, be, a, chargeable, business), always, on, foot, is, that, which, commonly, giveth, the, law, or, at, least, the, reputation, amongst, all, neighbor, states, as, may, well, be, seen, in, spain, [348], which, hath, had, in, one, part, or, other, a, veteran, army, almost, continually, now, by, the, space, of, sixscore, years, to, be, master, of, the, sea, is, an, abridgment, of, a, monarchy, cicero, writing, to, atticus, of, pompey’s, preparation, against, cæsar, saith, “consilium, pompeii, plane, themistocleum, est, putat, enim, qui, mari, potitur, eum, rerum, potiri, [349], and, without, doubt, pompey, had, tired, out, cæsar, if, upon, vain, confidence, he, had, not, left, that, way, we, see, the, great, effects, of, battles, by, sea, the, battle, of, actium, decided, the, empire, of, the, world, the, battle, of, lepanto, arrested, the, greatness, of, the, turk, there, be, many, examples, where, sea-fights, have, been, final, to, the, war, but, this, is, when, princes, or, states, have, set, up, their, rest, upon, the, battles, but, thus, much, is, certain, that, he, that, commands, the, sea, is, at, great, liberty, and, may, take, as, much, and, as, little, of, the, war, as, he, will, whereas, those, that, be, strongest, by, land, are, many, times, nevertheless, in, great, straits, surely, at, this, day, with, us, of, europe, the, vantage, of, strength, at, sea, (which, is, one, of, the, principal, dowries, of, this, kingdom, of, great, britain), is, great, both, because, most, of, the, kingdoms, of, europe, are, not, merely, inland, but, girt, with, the, sea, most, part, of, their, compass, and, because, the, wealth, of, both, indies, seems, in, great, part, but, an, accessary, to, the, command, of, the, seas, the, wars, of, latter, ages, seem, to, be, made, in, the, dark, in, respect, of, the, glory, and, honor, which, reflected, upon, men, from, the, wars, in, ancient, time, there, be, now, for, martial, encouragement, some, degrees, and, orders, of, chivalry, which, nevertheless, are, conferred, promiscuously, upon, soldiers, and, no, soldiers, and, some, remembrance, perhaps, upon, the, escutcheon, and, some, hospitals, for, maimed, soldiers, and, such, like, things, but, in, ancient, times, the, trophies, erected, upon, the, place, of, the, victory, the, funeral, laudatives, [350], and, monuments, for, those, that, died, in, the, wars, the, crowns, and, garlands, personal, the, style, of, emperor, which, the, great, kings, of, the, world, after, borrowed, the, triumphs, of, the, generals, upon, their, return, the, great, donatives, and, largesses, upon, the, disbanding, of, the, armies, were, things, able, to, inflame, all, men’s, courages, but, above, all, that, of, the, triumph, amongst, the, romans, was, not, pageants, or, gaudery, but, one, of, the, wisest, and, noblest, institutions, that, ever, was, for, it, contained, three, things, honor, to, the, general, riches, to, the, treasury, out, of, the, spoils, and, donatives, to, the, army, but, that, honor, perhaps, were, not, fit, for, monarchies, except, it, be, in, the, person, of, the, monarch, himself, or, his, sons, as, it, came, to, pass, in, the, times, of, the, roman, emperors, who, did, impropriate, the, actual, triumphs, to, themselves, and, their, sons, for, such, wars, as, they, did, achieve, in, person, and, left, only, for, wars, achieved, by, subjects, some, triumphal, garments, and, ensigns, to, the, general, to, conclude, no, man, can, by, care-taking, (as, the, scripture, saith), “add, a, cubit, to, his, stature, ”[351], in, this, little, model, of, a, man’s, body, but, in, the, great, frame, of, kingdoms, and, commonwealths, it, is, in, the, power, of, princes, or, estates, to, add, amplitude, and, greatness, to, their, kingdom, for, by, introducing, such, ordinances, constitutions, and, customs, as, we, have, now, touched, they, may, sow, greatness, to, their, posterity, and, succession, but, these, things, are, commonly, not, observed, but, left, to, take, their, chance, there, is, a, wisdom, in, this, beyond, the, rules, of, physic, man’s, own, observation, what, he, finds, good, of, and, what, he, finds, hurt, of, is, the, best, physic, to, preserve, health, but, it, is, a, safer, conclusion, to, say, “this, agreeth, not, well, with, me, therefore, will, not, continue, it, ”, than, this, find, no, offence, of, this, therefore, may, use, it, ”, for, strength, of, nature, in, youth, passeth, over, many, excesses, which, are, owing[352], a, man, till, his, age, discern, of, the, coming, on, of, years, and, think, not, to, do, the, same, things, still, for, age, will, not, be, defied, beware, of, sudden, change, in, any, great, point, of, diet, and, if, necessity, enforce, it, fit, the, rest, to, it, for, it, is, a, secret, both, in, nature, and, state, that, it, is, safer, to, change, many, things, than, one, examine, thy, customs, of, diet, sleep, exercise, apparel, and, the, like, and, try, in, any, thing, thou, shalt, judge, hurtful, to, discontinue, it, by, little, and, little, but, so, as, if, thou, dost, find, any, inconvenience, by, the, change, thou, come, back, to, it, again, for, it, is, hard, to, distinguish, that, which, is, generally, held, good, and, wholesome, from, that, which, is, good, particularly, [353], and, fit, for, thine, own, body, to, be, free-minded, and, cheerfully, disposed, at, hours, of, meat, and, of, sleep, and, of, exercise, is, one, of, the, best, precepts, of, long, lasting, as, for, the, passions, and, studies, of, the, mind, avoid, envy, anxious, fears, anger, fretting, inwards, subtle, and, knotty, inquisitions, joys, and, exhilarations, in, excess, sadness, not, communicated, entertain, hopes, mirth, rather, than, joy, variety, of, delights, rather, than, surfeit, of, them, wonder, and, admiration, and, therefore, novelties, studies, that, fill, the, mind, with, splendid, and, illustrious, objects, as, histories, fables, and, contemplations, of, nature, if, you, fly, physic, in, health, altogether, it, will, be, too, strange, for, your, body, when, you, shall, need, it, if, you, make, it, too, familiar, it, will, work, no, extraordinary, effect, when, sickness, cometh, commend, rather, some, diet, for, certain, seasons, than, frequent, use, of, physic, except, it, be, grown, into, a, custom, for, those, diets, alter, the, body, more, and, trouble, it, less, despise, no, new, accident[354], in, your, body, but, ask, opinion[355], of, it, in, sickness, respect, health, principally, and, in, health, action, for, those, that, put, their, bodies, to, endure, in, health, may, in, most, sicknesses, which, are, not, very, sharp, be, cured, only, with, diet, and, tendering, celsus, could, never, have, spoken, it, as, a, physician, had, he, not, been, a, wise, man, withal, when, he, giveth, it, for, one, of, the, great, precepts, of, health, and, lasting, that, a, man, do, vary, and, interchange, contraries, but, with, an, inclination, to, the, more, benign, extreme, use, fasting, and, full, eating, but, rather, full, eating, [356], watching, and, sleep, but, rather, sleep, sitting, and, exercise, but, rather, exercise, and, the, like, so, shall, nature, be, cherished, and, yet, taught, masteries, [357], physicians, are, some, of, them, so, pleasing, and, conformable, to, the, humor, of, the, patient, as, they, press, not, the, true, cure, of, the, disease, and, some, other, are, so, regular, in, proceeding, according, to, art, for, the, disease, as, they, respect, not, sufficiently, the, condition, of, the, patient, take, one, of, a, middle, temper, or, if, it, may, not, be, found, in, one, man, combine, two, of, either, sort, and, forget, not, to, call, as, well, the, best, acquainted, with, your, body, as, the, best, reputed, of, for, his, faculty, suspicions, amongst, thoughts, are, like, bats, amongst, birds, they, ever, fly, by, twilight, certainly, they, are, to, be, repressed, or, at, the, least, well, guarded, for, they, cloud, the, mind, they, lose, friends, and, they, check, with, business, whereby, business, cannot, go, on, currently, and, constantly, they, dispose, kings, to, tyranny, husbands, to, jealousy, wise, men, to, irresolution, and, melancholy, they, are, defects, not, in, the, heart, but, in, the, brain, for, they, take, place, in, the, stoutest, natures, as, in, the, example, of, henry, the, seventh, of, england, there, was, not, a, more, suspicious, man, nor, a, more, stout, and, in, such, a, composition, they, do, small, hurt, for, commonly, they, are, not, admitted, but, with, examination, whether, they, be, likely, or, no, but, in, fearful, natures, they, gain, ground, too, fast, there, is, nothing, makes, a, man, suspect, much, more, than, to, know, little, and, therefore, men, should, remedy, suspicion, by, procuring, to, know, more, and, not, to, keep, their, suspicions, in, smother, what, would, men, have, do, they, think, those, they, employ, and, deal, with, are, saints, do, they, not, think, they, will, have, their, own, ends, and, be, truer, to, themselves, than, to, them, therefore, there, is, no, better, way, to, moderate, suspicions, than, to, account, upon, such, suspicions, as, true, and, yet, to, bridle, them, as, false, [358], for, so, far, a, man, ought, to, make, use, of, suspicions, as, to, provide, as, if, that, should, be, true, that, he, suspects, yet, it, may, do, him, no, hurt, suspicions, that, the, mind, of, itself, gathers, are, but, buzzes, but, suspicions, that, are, artificially, nourished, and, put, into, men’s, heads, by, the, tales, and, whisperings, of, others, have, stings, certainly, the, best, mean, to, clear, the, way, in, this, same, wood, of, suspicions, is, frankly, to, communicate, them, with, the, party, that, he, suspects, for, thereby, he, shall, be, sure, to, know, more, of, the, truth, of, them, than, he, did, before, and, withal, shall, make, that, party, more, circumspect, not, to, give, further, cause, of, suspicion, but, this, would, not, be, done, to, men, of, base, natures, for, they, if, they, find, themselves, once, suspected, will, never, be, true, the, italian, says, “sospetto, licentia, fede, ”[359], as, if, suspicion, did, give, a, passport, to, faith, but, it, ought, rather, to, kindle, it, to, discharge, itself, some, in, their, discourse, desire, rather, commendation, of, wit, in, being, able, to, hold, all, arguments, [360], than, of, judgment, in, discerning, what, is, true, as, if, it, were, a, praise, to, know, what, might, be, said, and, not, what, should, be, thought, some, have, certain, commonplaces, and, themes, wherein, they, are, good, and, want, variety, which, kind, of, poverty, is, for, the, most, part, tedious, and, when, it, is, once, perceived, ridiculous, the, honorablest, part, of, talk, is, to, give, the, occasion, [361], and, again, to, moderate, and, pass, to, somewhat, else, for, then, a, man, leads, the, dance, it, is, good, in, discourse, and, speech, of, conversation, to, vary, and, intermingle, speech, of, the, present, occasion, with, arguments, tales, with, reasons, asking, of, questions, with, telling, of, opinions, and, jest, with, earnest, for, it, is, a, dull, thing, to, tire, and, as, we, say, now, to, jade, any, thing, too, far, as, for, jest, there, be, certain, things, which, ought, to, be, privileged, from, it, namely, religion, matters, of, state, great, persons, any, man’s, present, business, of, importance, and, any, case, that, deserveth, pity, yet, there, be, some, that, think, their, wits, have, been, asleep, except, they, dart, out, somewhat, that, is, piquant, and, to, the, quick, that, is, a, vein, which, would, be, bridled, [362]—, “parce, puer, stimulis, et, fortius, utere, loris, ”[363], and, generally, men, ought, to, find, the, difference, between, saltness, and, bitterness, certainly, he, that, hath, a, satirical, vein, as, he, maketh, others, afraid, of, his, wit, so, he, had, need, be, afraid, of, others’, memory, he, that, questioneth, much, shall, learn, much, and, content, much, but, especially, if, he, apply, his, questions, to, the, skill, of, the, persons, whom, he, asketh, for, he, shall, give, them, occasion, to, please, themselves, in, speaking, and, himself, shall, continually, gather, knowledge, but, let, his, questions, not, be, troublesome, for, that, is, fit, for, a, poser, [364], and, let, him, be, sure, to, leave, other, men, their, turns, to, speak, nay, if, there, be, any, that, would, reign, and, take, up, all, the, time, let, him, find, means, to, take, them, off, and, to, bring, others, on, as, musicians, used, to, do, with, those, that, dance, too, long, galliards, [365], if, you, dissemble, sometimes, your, knowledge, of, that, you, are, thought, to, know, you, shall, be, thought, another, time, to, know, that, you, know, not, speech, of, a, man’s, self, ought, to, be, seldom, and, well, chosen, knew, one, was, wont, to, say, in, scorn, “he, must, needs, be, a, wise, man, he, speaks, so, much, of, himself, ”, and, there, is, but, one, case, wherein, a, man, may, commend, himself, with, good, grace, and, that, is, in, commending, virtue, in, another, especially, if, it, be, such, a, virtue, whereunto, himself, pretendeth, speech, of, touch[366], towards, others, should, be, sparingly, used, for, discourse, ought, to, be, as, a, field, without, coming, home, to, any, man, knew, two, noblemen, of, the, west, part, of, england, whereof, the, one, was, given, to, scoff, but, kept, ever, royal, cheer, in, his, house, the, other, would, ask, of, those, that, had, been, at, the, other’s, table, “tell, truly, was, there, never, a, flout[367], or, dry, blow[368], given, ”, to, which, the, guest, would, answer, “such, and, such, a, thing, passed, ”, the, lord, would, say, thought, he, would, mar, a, good, dinner, ”, discretion, of, speech, is, more, than, eloquence, and, to, speak, agreeably, to, him, with, whom, we, deal, is, more, than, to, speak, in, good, words, or, in, good, order, good, continued, speech, without, a, good, speech, of, interlocution, shows, slowness, and, a, good, reply, or, second, speech, without, a, good, settled, speech, showeth, shallowness, and, weakness, as, we, see, in, beasts, that, those, that, are, weakest, in, the, course, are, yet, nimblest, in, the, turn, as, it, is, betwixt, the, greyhound, and, the, hare, to, use, too, many, circumstances, ere, one, come, to, the, matter, is, wearisome, to, use, none, at, all, is, blunt, [369], plantations, are, amongst, ancient, primitive, and, heroical, works, when, the, world, was, young, it, begat, more, children, but, now, it, is, old, it, begets, fewer, for, may, justly, account, new, plantations, to, be, the, children, of, former, kingdoms, like, a, plantation, in, a, pure, soil, that, is, where, people, are, not, displanted, [370], to, the, end, to, plant, in, others, for, else, it, is, rather, an, extirpation, than, a, plantation, planting, of, countries, is, like, planting, of, woods, for, you, must, make, account, to, lose, almost, twenty, years’, profit, and, expect, your, recompense, in, the, end, for, the, principal, thing, that, hath, been, the, destruction, of, most, plantations, hath, been, the, base, and, hasty, drawing, of, profit, in, the, first, years, it, is, true, speedy, profit, is, not, to, be, neglected, as, far, as, may, stand, with, the, good, of, the, plantation, but, no, further, it, is, a, shameful, and, unblessed, thing[371], to, take, the, scum, of, people, and, wicked, condemned, men, to, be, the, people, with, whom, you, plant, and, not, only, so, but, it, spoileth, the, plantation, for, they, will, ever, live, like, rogues, and, not, fall, to, work, but, be, lazy, and, do, mischief, and, spend, victuals, and, be, quickly, weary, and, then, certify, over, to, their, country, to, the, discredit, of, the, plantation, the, people, wherewith, you, plant, ought, to, be, gardeners, ploughmen, laborers, smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers, with, some, few, apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and, bakers, in, a, country, of, plantations, first, look, about, what, kind, of, victual, the, country, yields, of, itself, to, hand, as, chestnuts, walnuts, pine-apples, olives, dates, plums, cherries, wild, honey, and, the, like, and, make, use, of, them, then, consider, what, victual, or, esculent, things, there, are, which, grow, speedily, and, within, the, year, as, parsnips, carrots, turnips, onions, radish, artichokes, of, jerusalem, maize, and, the, like, for, wheat, barley, and, oats, they, ask, too, much, labor, but, with, pease, and, beans, you, may, begin, both, because, they, ask, less, labor, and, because, they, serve, for, meat, as, well, as, for, bread, and, of, rice, likewise, cometh, a, great, increase, and, it, is, a, kind, of, meat, above, all, there, ought, to, be, brought, store, of, biscuit, oatmeal, flour, meal, and, the, like, in, the, beginning, till, bread, may, be, had, for, beasts, or, birds, take, chiefly, such, as, are, least, subject, to, diseases, and, multiply, fastest, as, swine, goats, cocks, hens, turkeys, geese, house-doves, and, the, like, the, victual, in, plantations, ought, to, be, expended, almost, as, in, a, besieged, town, that, is, with, certain, allowance, and, let, the, main, part, of, the, ground, employed, to, gardens, or, corn, be, to, a, common, stock, and, to, be, laid, in, and, stored, up, and, then, delivered, out, in, proportion, besides, some, spots, of, ground, that, any, particular, person, will, manure, for, his, own, private, use, consider, likewise, what, commodities, the, soil, where, the, plantation, is, doth, naturally, yield, that, they, may, some, way, help, to, defray, the, charge, of, the, plantation, so, it, be, not, as, was, said, to, the, untimely, prejudice, of, the, main, business, as, it, hath, fared, with, tobacco, in, virginia, [372], wood, commonly, aboundeth, but, too, much, and, therefore, timber, is, fit, to, be, one, if, there, be, iron, ore, and, streams, whereupon, to, set, the, mills, iron, is, a, brave, commodity, where, wood, aboundeth, making, of, bay-salt, if, the, climate, be, proper, for, it, would, be, put, in, experience, growing, silk, likewise, if, any, be, is, a, likely, commodity, pitch, and, tar, where, store, of, firs, and, pines, are, will, not, fail, so, drugs, and, sweet, woods, where, they, are, cannot, but, yield, great, profit, soap-ashes, likewise, and, other, things, that, may, be, thought, of, but, moil[373], not, too, much, under, ground, for, the, hope, of, mines, is, very, uncertain, and, useth, to, make, the, planters, lazy, in, other, things, for, government, let, it, be, in, the, hands, of, one, assisted, with, some, counsel, and, let, them, have, commission, to, exercise, martial, laws, with, some, limitation, and, above, all, let, men, make, that, profit, of, being, in, the, wilderness, as, they, have, god, always, and, his, service, before, their, eyes, let, not, the, government, of, the, plantation, depend, upon, too, many, counsellors, and, undertakers, in, the, country, that, planteth, but, upon, a, temperate, number, and, let, those, be, rather, noblemen, and, gentlemen, than, merchants, for, they, look, ever, to, the, present, gain, let, there, be, freedoms, from, custom, till, the, plantation, be, of, strength, and, not, only, freedom, from, custom, but, freedom, to, carry, their, commodities, where, they, may, make, their, best, of, them, except, there, be, some, special, cause, of, caution, cram, not, in, people, by, sending, too, fast, company, after, company, but, rather, hearken, how, they, waste, and, send, supplies, proportionably, but, so, as, the, number, may, live, well, in, the, plantation, and, not, by, surcharge, be, in, penury, it, hath, been, a, great, endangering, to, the, health, of, some, plantations, that, they, have, built, along, the, sea, and, rivers, in, marish[374], and, unwholesome, grounds, therefore, though, you, begin, there, to, avoid, carriage, and, other, like, discommodities, yet, build, still, rather, upwards, from, the, streams, than, along, it, concerneth, likewise, the, health, of, the, plantation, that, they, have, good, store, of, salt, with, them, that, they, may, use, it, in, their, victuals, when, it, shall, be, necessary, if, you, plant, where, savages, are, do, not, only, entertain, them, with, trifles, and, gingles, [375], but, use, them, justly, and, graciously, with, sufficient, guard, nevertheless, and, do, not, win, their, favor, by, helping, them, to, invade, their, enemies, but, for, their, defence, it, is, not, amiss, and, send, oft, of, them, over, to, the, country, that, plants, that, they, may, see, a, better, condition, than, their, own, and, commend, it, when, they, return, when, the, plantation, grows, to, strength, then, it, is, time, to, plant, with, women, as, well, as, with, men, that, the, plantation, may, spread, into, generations, and, not, be, ever, pieced, from, without, it, is, the, sinfullest, thing, in, the, world, to, forsake, or, destitute, a, plantation, once, in, forwardness, for, besides, the, dishonor, it, is, the, guiltiness, of, blood, of, many, commiserable, persons, cannot, call, riches, better, than, the, baggage, of, virtue, the, roman, word, is, better, “impedimenta, ”, for, as, the, baggage, is, to, an, army, so, is, riches, to, virtue, it, cannot, be, spared, nor, left, behind, but, it, hindereth, the, march, yea, and, the, care, of, it, sometimes, loseth, or, disturbeth, the, victory, of, great, riches, there, is, no, real, use, except, it, be, in, the, distribution, the, rest, is, but, conceit, so, saith, solomon, “where, much, is, there, are, many, to, consume, it, and, what, hath, the, owner, but, the, sight, of, it, with, his, eyes, ”[376], the, personal, fruition, in, any, man, cannot, reach, to, feel, great, riches, there, is, a, custody, of, them, or, a, power, of, dole, and, donative, of, them, or, a, fame, of, them, but, no, solid, use, to, the, owner, do, you, not, see, what, feigned, prices, are, set, upon, little, stones, and, rarities, and, what, works, of, ostentation, are, undertaken, because, there, might, seem, to, be, some, use, of, great, riches, but, then, you, will, say, they, may, be, of, use, to, buy, men, out, of, dangers, or, troubles, as, solomon, saith, “riches, are, as, a, strong-hold, in, the, imagination, of, the, rich, man, ”[377], but, this, is, excellently, expressed, that, it, is, in, imagination, and, not, always, in, fact, for, certainly, great, riches, have, sold, more, men, than, they, have, bought, out, seek, not, proud, riches, but, such, as, thou, mayest, get, justly, use, soberly, distribute, cheerfully, and, leave, contentedly, yet, have, no, abstract, nor, friarly, contempt, of, them, but, distinguish, as, cicero, saith, well, of, rabirius, posthumus, “in, studio, rei, amplificandæ, apparebat, non, avaritiæ, prædam, sed, instrumentum, bonitati, quæri, ”[378], hearken, also, to, solomon, and, beware, of, hasty, gathering, of, riches, “qui, festinat, ad, divitias, non, erit, insons, ”[379], the, poets, feign, that, when, plutus, (which, is, riches), is, sent, from, jupiter, he, limps, and, goes, slowly, but, when, he, is, sent, from, pluto, he, runs, and, is, swift, of, foot, meaning, that, riches, gotten, by, good, means, and, just, labor, pace, slowly, but, when, they, come, by, the, death, of, others[380], (as, by, the, course, of, inheritance, testaments, and, the, like), they, come, tumbling, upon, a, man, but, it, might, be, applied, likewise, to, pluto, taking, him, for, the, devil, for, when, riches, come, from, the, devil, (as, by, fraud, and, oppression, and, unjust, means), they, come, upon, speed, the, ways, to, enrich, are, many, and, most, of, them, foul, parsimony, is, one, of, the, best, and, yet, is, not, innocent, for, it, withholdeth, men, from, works, of, liberality, and, charity, the, improvement, of, the, ground, is, the, most, natural, obtaining, of, riches, for, it, is, our, great, mother’s, blessing, the, earth’s, but, it, is, slow, and, yet, where, men, of, great, wealth, do, stoop, to, husbandry, it, multiplieth, riches, exceedingly, knew, a, nobleman, in, england, that, had, the, greatest, audits[381], of, any, man, in, my, time, a, great, grazier, a, great, sheep-master, a, great, timber-man, a, great, collier, a, great, corn-master, a, great, lead-man, and, so, of, iron, and, a, number, of, the, like, points, of, husbandry, so, as, the, earth, seemed, a, sea, to, him, in, respect, of, the, perpetual, importation, it, was, truly, observed, by, one, “that, himself, came, very, hardly, to, a, little, riches, and, very, easily, to, great, riches, ”, for, when, a, man’s, stock, is, come, to, that, that, he, can, expect, the, prime, of, markets, [382], and, overcome, those, bargains, which, for, their, greatness, are, few, men’s, money, and, be, partner, in, the, industries, of, younger, men, he, cannot, but, increase, mainly, the, gains, of, ordinary, trades, and, vocations, are, honest, and, furthered, by, two, things, chiefly, by, diligence, and, by, a, good, name, for, good, and, fair, dealing, but, the, gains, of, bargains, are, of, a, more, doubtful, nature, when, men, shall, wait, upon, others’, necessity, broke, by, servants, and, instruments, to, draw, them, on, put, off, others, cunningly, that, would, be, better, chapmen, and, the, like, practices, which, are, crafty, and, naught, as, for, the, chopping, of, bargains, when, a, man, buys, not, to, hold, but, to, sell, over, again, that, commonly, grindeth, double, both, upon, the, seller, and, upon, the, buyer, sharings, do, greatly, enrich, if, the, hands, be, well, chosen, that, are, trusted, usury, is, the, certainest, means, of, gain, though, one, of, the, worst, as, that, whereby, a, man, doth, eat, his, bread, “in, sudore, vultûs, alieni, ”[383], and, besides, doth, plough, upon, sundays, but, yet, certain, though, it, be, it, hath, flaws, for, that, the, scriveners, and, brokers, do, value, unsound, men, to, serve, their, own, turn, the, fortune, in, being, the, first, in, an, invention, or, in, a, privilege, doth, cause, sometimes, a, wonderful, overgrowth, in, riches, as, it, was, with, the, first, sugar-man[384], in, the, canaries, therefore, if, a, man, can, play, the, true, logician, to, have, as, well, judgment, as, invention, he, may, do, great, matters, especially, if, the, times, be, fit, he, that, resteth, upon, gains, certain, shall, hardly, grow, to, great, riches, and, he, that, puts, all, upon, adventures, doth, oftentimes, break, and, come, to, poverty, it, is, good, therefore, to, guard, adventures, with, certainties, that, may, uphold, losses, monopolies, and, coemption, of, wares, for, resale, where, they, are, not, restrained, are, great, means, to, enrich, especially, if, the, party, have, intelligence, what, things, are, like, to, come, into, request, and, so, store, himself, beforehand, riches, gotten, by, service, though, it, be, of, the, best, rise, yet, when, they, are, gotten, by, flattery, feeding, humors, and, other, servile, conditions, they, may, be, placed, amongst, the, worst, as, for, fishing, for, testaments, and, executorships, (as, tacitus, saith, of, seneca, “testamenta, et, orbos, tanquam, indagine, capi”), [385], it, is, yet, worse, by, how, much, men, submit, themselves, to, meaner, persons, than, in, service, believe, not, much, them, that, seem, to, despise, riches, for, they, despise, them, that, despair, of, them, and, none, worse, when, they, come, to, them, be, not, penny-wise, riches, have, wings, and, sometimes, they, fly, away, of, themselves, sometimes, they, must, be, set, flying, to, bring, in, more, men, leave, their, riches, either, to, their, kindred, or, to, the, public, and, moderate, portions, prosper, best, in, both, great, state, left, to, an, heir, is, as, a, lure, to, all, the, birds, of, prey, round, about, to, seize, on, him, if, he, be, not, the, better, stablished, in, years, and, judgment, likewise, glorious, gifts, and, foundations, are, like, sacrifices, without, salt, and, but, the, painted, sepulchres, of, alms, which, soon, will, putrefy, and, corrupt, inwardly, therefore, measure, not, thine, advancements, by, quantity, but, frame, them, by, measure, and, defer, not, charities, till, death, for, certainly, if, a, man, weigh, it, rightly, he, that, doth, so, is, rather, liberal, of, another, man’s, than, of, his, own, mean, not, to, speak, of, divine, prophecies, nor, of, heathen, oracles, nor, of, natural, predictions, but, only, of, prophecies, that, have, been, of, certain, memory, and, from, hidden, causes, saith, the, pythonissa[386], to, saul, “to-morrow, thou, and, thy, sons, shall, be, with, me, ”, virgil, hath, these, verses, from, homer, —, “hic, domus, æneæ, cunctis, dominabitur, oris, et, nati, natorum, et, qui, nascentur, ab, illis, ”[387], prophecy, as, it, seems, of, the, roman, empire, seneca, the, tragedian, hath, these, verses, —, “venient, annis, sæcula, seris, quibus, oceanus, vincula, rerum, laxet, et, ingens, pateat, tellus, tiphysque, novos, detegat, orbes, nec, sit, terris, ultima, thule, ”[388], prophecy, of, the, discovery, of, america, the, daughter, of, polycrates[389], dreamed, that, jupiter, bathed, her, father, and, apollo, anointed, him, and, it, came, to, pass, that, he, was, crucified, in, an, open, place, where, the, sun, made, his, body, run, with, sweat, and, the, rain, washed, it, philip, of, macedon, dreamed, he, sealed, up, his, wife’s, belly, whereby, he, did, expound, it, that, his, wife, should, be, barren, but, aristander, the, soothsayer, told, him, his, wife, was, with, child, because, men, do, not, use, to, seal, vessels, that, are, empty, [390], phantasm, that, appeared, to, brutus, in, his, tent, said, to, him, “philippis, iterum, me,

slain, that, a, golden, head, was, growing, out, of, the, nape, of, his, neck, [394], and, indeed, the, succession, that, followed, him, for, many, years, made, golden, times, henry, the, sixth, of, england, said, of, henry, the, seventh, when, he, was, a, lad, and, gave, him, water, “this, is, the, lad, that, shall, enjoy, the, crown, for, which, we, strive, ”, when, was, in, france, heard, from, one, dr, pena, that, the, queen, mother, [395], who, was, given, to, curious, arts, caused, the, king, her, husband’s, nativity, to, be, calculated, under, a, false, name, and, the, astrologer, gave, a, judgment, that, he, should, be, killed, in, a, duel, at, which, the, queen, laughed, thinking, her, husband, to, be, above, challenges, and, duels, but, he, was, slain, upon, a, course, at,

years, was, “when, hempe, is, spunne, england’s, done, ”, whereby, it, was, generally, conceived, that, after, the, princes, had, reigned, which, had, the, principal, letters, of, that, word, hempe, (which, were, henry, edward, mary, philip, and, elizabeth), england, should, come, to, utter, confusion, which, thanks, be, to, god, is, verified, only, in, the, change, of, the, name, for, that, the, king’s, style, is, now, no, more, of, england, but, of, britain, [396], there, was, also, another, prophecy, before, the, year, of, eighty-eight, which, do, not, well, understand, “there, shall, be, seen, upon, a, day, between, the, baugh, and, the, may, the, black, fleet, of, norway, when, that, that, is, come, and, gone, england, build, houses, of, lime, and, stone, for, after, wars, you, shall, have, none, ”, it, was, generally, conceived, to, be, meant, of, the, spanish, fleet, that, came, in, eighty-eight, for, that, the, king, of, spain’s, surname, as, they, say, is, norway, the, prediction, of, regiomontanus, “octogesimus, octavus, mirabilis, annus, ”[397], was, thought, likewise, accomplished, in, the, sending, of, that, great, fleet, being, the, greatest, in, strength, though, not, in, number, of, all, that, ever, swam, upon, the, sea, as, for, cleon’s, dream, [398], think, it, was, a, jest, it, was, that, he, was, devoured, of, a, long, dragon, and, it, was, expounded, of, a, maker, of, sausages, that, troubled, him, exceedingly, there, are, numbers, of, the, like, kind, especially, if, you, include, dreams, and, predictions, of, astrology, but, have, set, down, these, few, only, of, certain, credit, for, example, my, judgment, is, that, they, ought, all, to, be, despised, and, ought, to, serve, but, for, winter, talk, by, the, fireside, though, when, say, despised, mean, it, as, for, belief, for, otherwise, the, spreading, or, publishing, of, them, is, in, no, sort, to, be, despised, for, they, have, done, much, mischief, and, see, many, severe, laws, made, to, suppress, them, that, that, hath, given, them, grace, and, some, credit, consisteth, in, three, things, first, that, men, mark, when, they, hit, and, never, mark, when, they, miss, [399], as, they, do, generally, also, of, dreams, the, second, is, that, probable, conjectures, or, obscure, traditions, many, times, turn, themselves, into, prophecies, while, the, nature, of, man, which, coveteth, divination, thinks, it, no, peril, to, foretell, that, which, indeed, they, do, but, collect, as, that, of, seneca’s, verse, for, so, much, was, then, subject, to, demonstration, that, the, globe, of, the, earth, had, great, parts, beyond, the, atlantic, which, might, be, probably, conceived, not, to, be, all, sea, and, adding, thereto, the, tradition, in, plato’s, timæus, and, his, atlanticus, [400], it, might, encourage, one, to, turn, it, to, a, prediction, the, third, and, last, (which, is, the, great, one), is, that, almost, all, of, them, being, infinite, in, number, have, been, impostures, and, by, idle, and, crafty, brains, merely, contrived, and, feigned, after, the, event, past, ambition, is, like, choler, which, is, a, humor, that, maketh, men, active, earnest, full, of, alacrity, and, stirring, if, it, be, not, stopped, but, if, it, be, stopped, and, cannot, have, its, way, it, becometh, adust, [401], and, thereby, malign, and, venomous, so, ambitious, men, if, they, find, the, way, open, for, their, rising, and, still, get, forward, they, are, rather, busy, than, dangerous, but, if, they, be, checked, in, their, desires, they, become, secretly, discontent, and, look, upon, men, and, matters, with, an, evil, eye, and, are, best, pleased, when, things, go, backward, which, is, the, worst, property, in, a, servant, of, a, prince, or, state, therefore, it, is, good, for, princes, if, they, use, ambitious, men, to, handle, it, so, as, they, be, still, progressive, and, not, retrograde, which, because, it, cannot, be, without, inconvenience, it, is, good, not, to, use, such, natures, at, all, for, if, they, rise, not, with, their, service, they, will, take, order, to, make, their, service, fall, with, them, but, since, we, have, said, it, were, good, not, to, use, men, of, ambitious, natures, except, it, be, upon, necessity, it, is, fit, we, speak, in, what, cases, they, are, of, necessity, good, commanders, in, the, wars, must, be, taken, be, they, never, so, ambitious, for, the, use, of, their, service, dispenseth, with, the, rest, and, to, take, a, soldier, without, ambition, is, to, pull, off, his, spurs, there, is, also, great, use, of, ambitious, men, in, being, screens, to, princes, in, matters, of, danger, and, envy, for, no, man, will, take, that, part, except, he, be, like, a, seeled[402], dove, that, mounts, and, mounts, because, he, cannot, see, about, him, there, is, use, also, of, ambitious, men, in, pulling, down, the, greatness, of, any, subject, that, overtops, as, tiberius, used, macro[403], in, the, pulling, down, of, sejanus, since, therefore, they, must, be, used, in, such, cases, there, resteth, to, speak, how, they, are, to, be, bridled, that, they, may, be, less, dangerous, there, is, less, danger, of, them, if, they, be, of, mean, birth, than, if, they, be, noble, and, if, they, be, rather, harsh, of, nature, than, gracious, and, popular, and, if, they, be, rather, new, raised, than, grown, cunning, and, fortified, in, their, greatness, it, is, counted, by, some, a, weakness, in, princes, to, have, favorites, but, it, is, of, all, others, the, best, remedy, against, ambitious, great, ones, for, when, the, way, of, pleasuring, and, displeasuring, lieth, by, the, favorite, it, is, impossible, any, other, should, be, over-great, another, means, to, curb, them, is, to, balance, them, by, others, as, proud, as, they, but, then, there, must, be, some, middle, counsellors, to, keep, things, steady, for, without, that, ballast, the, ship, will, roll, too, much, at, the, least, a, prince, may, animate, and, inure, some, meaner, persons, to, be, as, it, were, scourges, to, ambitious, men, as, for, the, having, of, them, obnoxious, to[404], ruin, if, they, be, of, fearful, natures, it, may, do, well, but, if, they, be, stout, and, daring, it, may, precipitate, their, designs, and, prove, dangerous, as, for, the, pulling, of, them, down, if, the, affairs, require, it, and, that, it, may, not, be, done, with, safety, suddenly, the, only, way, is, the, interchange, continually, of, favors, and, disgraces, whereby, they, may, not, know, what, to, expect, and, be, as, it, were, in, a, wood, of, ambitions, it, is, less, harmful, the, ambition, to, prevail, in, great, things, than, that, other, to, appear, in, every, thing, for, that, breeds, confusion, and, mars, business, but, yet, it, is, less, danger, to, have, an, ambitious, man, stirring, in, business, than, great, in, dependencies, he, that, seeketh, to, be, eminent, amongst, able, men, hath, a, great, task, but, that, is, ever, good, for, the, public, but, he, that, plots, to, be, the, only, figure, amongst, ciphers, is, the, decay, of, a, whole, age, honor, hath, three, things, in, it, the, vantage-ground, to, do, good, the, approach, to, kings, and, principal, persons, and, the, raising, of, a, man’s, own, fortunes, he, that, hath, the, best, of, these, intentions, when, he, aspireth, is, an, honest, man, and, that, prince, that, can, discern, of, these, intentions, in, another, that, aspireth, is, a, wise, prince, generally, let, princes, and, states, choose, such, ministers, as, are, more, sensible, of, duty, than, of, rising, and, such, as, love, business, rather, upon, conscience, than, upon, bravery, and, let, them, discern, a, busy, nature, from, a, willing, mind, these, things, are, but, toys, to, come, amongst, such, serious, observations, but, yet, since, princes, will, have, such, things, it, is, better, they, should, be, graced, with, elegancy, than, daubed, with, cost, dancing, to, song, is, a, thing, of, great, state, and, pleasure, understand, it, that, the, song, be, in, choir, placed, aloft, and, accompanied, with, some, broken, music, and, the, ditty, fitted, to, the, device, acting, in, song, especially, in, dialogues, hath, an, extreme, good, grace, say, acting, not, dancing, (for, that, is, a, mean, and, vulgar, thing), and, the, voices, of, the, dialogue, would, be, strong, and, manly, (a, base, and, a, tenor, no, treble), and, the, ditty, high, and, tragical, not, nice, or, dainty, several, choirs, placed, one, over, against, another, and, taking, the, voices, by, catches, anthem-wise, give, great, pleasure, turning, dances, into, figure, is, a, childish, curiosity, and, generally, let, it, be, noted, that, those, things, which, here, set, down, are, such, as, do, naturally, take, the, sense, and, not, respect, petty, wonderments, it, is, true, the, alterations, of, scenes, so, it, be, quietly, and, without, noise, are, things, of, great, beauty, and, pleasure, for, they, feed, and, relieve, the, eye, before, it, be, full, of, the, same, object, let, the, scenes, abound, with, light, specially, colored, and, varied, and, let, the, masquers, or, any, other, that, are, to, come, down, from, the, scene, have, some, motions, upon, the, scene, itself, before, their, coming, down, for, it, draws, the, eye, strangely, and, makes, it, with, great, pleasure, to, desire, to, see, that, it, cannot, perfectly, discern, let, the, songs, be, loud, and, cheerful, and, not, chirpings, or, pulings, [405], let, the, music, likewise, be, sharp, and, loud, and, well, placed, the, colors, that, show, best, by, candlelight, are, white, carnation, and, a, kind, of, sea-water, green, and, ouches, [406], or, spangs, [407], as, they, are, of, no, great, cost, so, they, are, of, most, glory, as, for, rich, embroidery, it, is, lost, and, not, discerned, let, the, suits, of, the, masquers, be, graceful, and, such, as, become, the, person, when, the, vizors, are, off, not, after, examples, of, known, attires, turks, soldiers, mariners, and, the, like, let, anti-masques[408], not, be, long, they, have, been, commonly, of, fools, satyrs, baboons, wild, men, antics, beasts, sprites, witches, ethiopes, pigmies, turquets, [409], nymphs, rustics, cupids, statues, moving, and, the, like, as, for, angels, it, is, not, comical, enough, to, put, them, in, anti-masques, and, any, thing, that, is, hideous, as, devils, giants, is, on, the, other, side, as, unfit, but, chiefly, let, the, music, of, them, be, recreative, and, with, some, strange, changes, some, sweet, odors, suddenly, coming, forth, without, any, drops, falling, are, in, such, a, company, as, there, is, steam, and, heat, things, of, great, pleasure, and, refreshment, double, masques, one, of, men, another, of, ladies, addeth, state, and, variety, but, all, is, nothing, except, the, room, be, kept, clear, and, neat, for, justs, and, tourneys, and, barriers, the, glories, of, them, are, chiefly, in, the, chariots, wherein, the, challengers, make, their, entry, especially, if, they, be, drawn, with, strange, beasts, as, lions, bears, camels, and, the, like, or, in, the, devices, of, their, entrance, or, in, the, bravery, of, their, liveries, or, in, the, goodly, furniture, of, their, horses, and, armor, but, enough, of, these, toys, nature, is, often, hidden, sometimes, overcome, seldom, extinguished, force, maketh, nature, more, violent, in, the, return, doctrine, and, discourse, maketh, nature, less, importune, but, custom, only, doth, alter, and, subdue, nature, he, that, seeketh, victory, over, his, nature, let, him, not, set, himself, too, great, nor, too, small, tasks, for, the, first, will, make, him, dejected, by, often, failings, and, the, second, will, make, him, a, small, proceeder, though, by, often, prevailings, and, at, the, first, let, him, practise, with, helps, as, swimmers, do, with, bladders, or, rushes, but, after, a, time, let, him, practise, with, disadvantages, as, dancers, do, with, thick, shoes, for, it, breeds, great, perfection, if, the, practice, be, harder, than, the, use, where, nature, is, mighty, and, therefore, the, victory, hard, the, degrees, had, need, be, first, to, stay, and, arrest, nature, in, time, like, to, him, that, would, say, over, the, four, and, twenty, letters, when, he, was, angry, then, to, go, less, in, quantity, as, if, one, should, in, forbearing, wine, come, from, drinking, healths, to, a, draught, at, a, meal, and, lastly, to, discontinue, altogether, but, if, a, man, have, the, fortitude, and, resolution, to, enfranchise, himself, at, once, that, is, the, best, —, “optimus, ille, animi, vindex, lædentia, pectus, vincula, qui, rupit, dedoluitque, semel, ”[410], neither, is, the, ancient, rule, amiss, to, bend, nature, as, a, wand, to, a, contrary, extreme, whereby, to, set, it, right, understanding, it, where, the, contrary, extreme, is, no, vice, let, not, a, man, force, a, habit, upon, himself, with, a, perpetual, continuance, but, with, some, intermission, for, both, the, pause, reinforceth, the, new, onset, and, if, a, man, that, is, not, perfect, be, ever, in, practice, he, shall, as, well, practise, his, errors, as, his, abilities, and, induce, one, habit, of, both, and, there, is, no, means, to, help, this, but, by, seasonable, intermissions, but, let, not, a, man, trust, his, victory, over, his, nature, too, far, for, nature, will, lie, buried, a, great, time, and, yet, revive, upon, the, occasion, or, temptation, like, as, it, was, with, æsop’s, damsel, turned, from, a, cat, to, a, woman, who, sat, very, demurely, at, the, board’s, end, till, a, mouse, ran, before, her, therefore, let, a, man, either, avoid, the, occasion, altogether, or, put, himself, often, to, it, that, he, may, be, little, moved, with, it, man’s, nature, is, best, perceived, in, privateness, for, there, is, no, affectation, in, passion, for, that, putteth, a, man, out, of, his, precepts, and, in, a, new, case, or, experiment, for, there, custom, leaveth, him, they, are, happy, men, whose, natures, sort, with, their, vocations, otherwise, they, may, say, “multum, incola, fuit, anima, mea, ”[411], when, they, converse, in, those, things, they, do, not, affect, in, studies, whatsoever, a, man, commandeth, upon, himself, let, him, set, hours, for, it, but, whatsoever, is, agreeable, to, his, nature, let, him, take, no, care, for, any, set, times, for, his, thoughts, will, fly, to, it, of, themselves, so, as, the, spaces, of, other, business, or, studies, will, suffice, man’s, nature, runs, either, to, herbs, or, weeds, therefore, let, him, seasonably, water, the, one, and, destroy, the, other, men’s, thoughts, are, much, according, to, their, inclination, [412], their, discourse, and, speeches, according, to, their, learning, and, infused, opinions, but, their, deeds, are, after, as, they, have, been, accustomed, and, therefore, as, machiavel, well, noteth, (though, in, an, evil-favored, instance), there, is, no, trusting, to, the, force, of, nature, nor, to, the, bravery, of, words, except, it, be, corroborate, by, custom, [413], his, instance, is, that, for, the, achieving, of, a, desperate, conspiracy, a, man, should, not, rest, upon, the, fierceness, of, any, man’s, nature, or, his, resolute, undertakings, but, take, such, a, one, as, hath, had, his, hands, formerly, in, blood, but, machiavel, knew, not, of, a, friar, clement, [414], nor, a, ravaillac, [415], nor, a, jaureguy, [416], nor, a, baltazar, gerard, [417], yet, his, rule, holdeth, still, that, nature, nor, the, engagement, of, words, are, not, so, forcible, as, custom, only, superstition, is, now, so, well, advanced, that, men, of, the, first, blood, are, as, firm, as, butchers, by, occupation, and, votary[418], resolution, is, made, equipollent, to, custom, even, in, matter, of, blood, in, other, things, the, predominancy, of, custom, is, everywhere, visible, insomuch, as, a, man, would, wonder, to, hear, men, profess, protest, engage, give, great, words, and, then, do, just, as, they, have, done, before, as, if, they, were, dead, images, and, engines, moved, only, by, the, wheels, of, custom, we, see, also, the, reign, or, tyranny, of, custom, what, it, is, the, indians[419], mean, the, sect, of, their, wise, men), lay, themselves, quietly, upon, a, stack, of, wood, and, so, sacrifice, themselves, by, fire, nay, the, wives, strive, to, be, burned, with, the, corpses, of, their, husbands, the, lads, of, sparta, of, ancient, time, were, wont, to, be, scourged, upon, the, altar, of, diana, without, so, much, as, quecking, [420], remember, in, the, beginning, of, queen, elizabeth’s, time, of, england, an, irish, rebel, condemned, put, up, a, petition, to, the, deputy, that, he, might, be, hanged, in, a, withe, and, not, in, a, halter, because, it, had, been, so, used, with, former, rebels, there, be, monks, in, russia, for, penance, that, will, sit, a, whole, night, in, a, vessel, of, water, till, they, be, engaged, with, hard, ice, many, examples, may, be, put, of, the, force, of, custom, both, upon, mind, and, body, therefore, since, custom, is, the, principal, magistrate, of, man’s, life, let, men, by, all, means, endeavor, to, obtain, good, customs, certainly, custom, is, most, perfect, when, it, beginneth, in, young, years, this, we, call, education, which, is, in, effect, but, an, early, custom, so, we, see, in, languages, the, tongue, is, more, pliant, to, all, expressions, and, sounds, the, joints, are, more, supple, to, all, feats, of, activity, and, motions, in, youth, than, afterwards, for, it, is, true, that, late, learners, cannot, so, well, take, the, ply, except, it, be, in, some, minds, that, have, not, suffered, themselves, to, fix, but, have, kept, themselves, open, and, prepared, to, receive, continual, amendment, which, is, exceeding, rare, but, if, the, force, of, custom, simple, and, separate, be, great, the, force, of, custom, copulate, and, conjoined, and, collegiate, is, far, greater, for, there, example, teacheth, company, comforteth, emulation, quickeneth, glory, raiseth, so, as, in, such, places, the, force, of, custom, is, in, his, exaltation, certainly, the, great, multiplication, of, virtues, upon, human, nature, resteth, upon, societies, well, ordained, and, disciplined, for, commonwealths, and, good, governments, do, nourish, virtue, grown, but, do, not, much, mend, the, seeds, but, the, misery, is, that, the, most, effectual, means, are, now, applied, to, the, ends, least, to, be, desired, it, cannot, be, denied, but, outward, accidents, conduce, much, to, fortune, favor, opportunity, death, of, others, occasion, fitting, virtue, but, chiefly, the, mould, of, a, man’s, fortune, is, in, his, own, hands, “faber, quisque, fortunæ, suæ, ”[421], saith, the, poet, and, the, most, frequent, of, external, causes, is, that, the, folly, of, one, man, is, the, fortune, of, another, for, no, man, prospers, so, suddenly, as, by, others’, errors, “serpens, nisi, serpentem, comederit, non, fit, draco, ”[422], overt, and, apparent, virtues, bring, forth, praise, but, there, be, secret, and, hidden, virtues, that, bring, forth, fortune, certain, deliveries, of, a, man’s, self, which, have, no, name, the, spanish, name, “disemboltura, ”[423], partly, expresseth, them, when, there, be, not, stonds[424], nor, restiveness, in, a, man’s, nature, but, that, the, wheels, of, his, mind, keep, way, with, the, wheels, of, his, fortune, for, so, livy, (after, he, had, described, cato, major, in, these, words, “in, illo, viro, tantum, robur, corporis, et, animi, fuit, ut, quocunque, loco, natus, esset, fortunam, sibi, facturus, videretur, ”)[425], falleth, upon, that, that, he, had, “versatile, ingenium, ”[426], therefore, if, a, man, look, sharply, and, attentively, he, shall, see, fortune, for, though, she, be, blind, yet, she, is, not, invisible, the, way, of, fortune, is, like, the, milky, way, in, the, sky, which, is, a, meeting, or, knot, of, a, number, of, small, stars, not, seen, asunder, but, giving, light, together, so, are, there, a, number, of, little, and, scarce, discerned, virtues, or, rather, faculties, and, customs, that, make, men, fortunate, the, italians, note, some, of, them, such, as, a, man, would, little, think, when, they, speak, of, one, that, cannot, do, amiss, they, will, throw, in, into, his, other, conditions, that, he, hath, “poco, di, matto, ”[427], and, certainly, there, be, not, two, more, fortunate, properties, than, to, have, a, little, of, the, fool, and, not, too, much, of, the, honest, therefore, extreme, lovers, of, their, country, or, masters, were, never, fortunate, neither, can, they, be, for, when, a, man, placeth, his, thoughts, without, himself, he, goeth, not, his, own, way, hasty, fortune, maketh, an, enterpriser, and, remover, (the, french, hath, it, better, “entreprenant, ”, or, “remuant”), but, the, exercised, fortune, maketh, the, able, man, fortune, is, to, be, honored, and, respected, and, it, be, but, for, her, daughters, confidence, and, reputation, for, those, two, felicity, breedeth, the, first, within, a, man’s, self, the, latter, in, others, towards, him, all, wise, men, to, decline, the, envy, of, their, own, virtues, use, to, ascribe, them, to, providence, and, fortune, for, so, they, may, the, better, assume, them, and, besides, it, is, greatness, in, a, man, to, be, the, care, of, the, higher, powers, so, cæsar, said, to, the, pilot, in, the, tempest, “cæsarem, portas, et, fortunam, ejus, ”[428], so, sylla, chose, the, name, of, “felix, ”[429], and, not, of, “magnus, ”[430], and, it, hath, been, noted, that, those, who, ascribe, openly, too, much, to, their, own, wisdom, and, policy, end, unfortunate, it, is, written, that, timotheus[431], the, athenian, after, he, had, in, the, account, he, gave, to, the, state, of, his, government, often, interlaced, his, speech, “and, in, this, fortune, had, no, part, ”, never, prospered, in, any, thing, he, undertook, afterwards, certainly, there, be, whose, fortunes, are, like, homer’s, verses, that, have, a, slide[432], and, easiness, more, than, the, verses, of, other, poets, as, plutarch, saith, of, timoleon’s, fortune, in, respect, of, that, of, agesilaus, or, epaminondas, and, that, this, should, be, no, doubt, it, is, much, in, a, man’s, self, [433], many, have, made, witty, invectives, against, usury, they, say, that, it, is, pity, the, devil, should, have, god’s, part, which, is, the, tithe, that, the, usurer, is, the, greatest, sabbath-breaker, because, his, plough, goeth, every, sunday, that, the, usurer, is, the, drone, that, virgil, speaketh, of, —, “ignavum, fucos, pecus, a, præsepibus, arcent, ”[434], that, the, usurer, breaketh, the, first, law, that, was, made, for, mankind, after, the, fall, which, was, “in, sudore, vultûs, tui, comedes, panem, tuum, ”[435], not, “in, sudore, vultûs, alieni, ”[436], that, usurers, should, have, orange-tawny[437], bonnets, because, they, do, judaize, that, it, is, against, nature, for, money, to, beget, money, and, the, like, say, this, only, that, usury, is, a, “concessum, propter, duritiem, cordis, ”[438], for, since, there, must, be, borrowing, and, lending, and, men, are, so, hard, of, heart, as, they, will, not, lend, freely, usury, must, be, permitted, some, others, have, made, suspicious, and, cunning, propositions, of, banks, discovery, of, men’s, estates, and, other, inventions, but, few, have, spoken, of, usury, usefully, it, is, good, to, set, before, us, the, incommodities, and, commodities, of, usury, that, the, good, may, be, either, weighed, out, or, culled, out, and, warily, to, provide, that, while, we, make, forth, to, that, which, is, better, we, meet, not, with, that, which, is, worse, the, discommodities, of, usury, are, first, that, it, makes, fewer, merchants, for, were, it, not, for, this, lazy, trade, of, usury, money, would, not, lie, still, but, would, in, great, part, be, employed, upon, merchandising, which, is, the, “vena, porta”[439], of, wealth, in, a, state, the, second, that, it, makes, poor, merchants, for, as, a, farmer, cannot, husband, his, ground, so, well, if, he, sit, at, a, great, rent, so, the, merchant, cannot, drive, his, trade, so, well, if, he, sit[440], at, great, usury, the, third, is, incident, to, the, other, two, and, that, is, the, decay, of, customs, of, kings, or, states, which, ebb, or, flow, with, merchandising, the, fourth, that, it, bringeth, the, treasure, of, a, realm, or, state, into, a, few, hands, for, the, usurer, being, at, certainties, and, others, at, uncertainties, at, the, end, of, the, game, most, of, the, money, will, be, in, the, box, and, ever, a, state, flourisheth, when, wealth, is, more, equally, spread, the, fifth, that, it, beats, down, the, price, of, land, for, the, employment, of, money, is, chiefly, either, merchandising, or, purchasing, and, usury, waylays, both, the, sixth, that, it, doth, dull, and, damp, all, industries, improvements, and, new, inventions, wherein, money, would, be, stirring, if, it, were, not, for, this, slug, the, last, that, it, is, the, canker, and, ruin, of, many, men’s, estates, which, in, process, of, time, breeds, a, public, poverty, on, the, other, side, the, commodities, of, usury, are, first, that, howsoever, usury, in, some, respect, hindereth, merchandising, yet, in, some, other, it, advanceth, it, for, it, is, certain, that, the, greatest, part, of, trade, is, driven, by, young, merchants, upon, borrowing, at, interest, so, as, if, the, usurer, either, call, in, or, keep, back, his, money, there, will, ensue, presently, a, great, stand, of, trade, the, second, is, that, were, it, not, for, this, easy, borrowing, upon, interest, men’s, necessities, would, draw, upon, them, a, most, sudden, undoing, in, that, they, would, be, forced, to, sell, their, means, (be, it, lands, or, goods), far, under, foot, and, so, whereas, usury, doth, but, gnaw, upon, them, bad, markets, would, swallow, them, quite, up, as, for, mortgaging, or, pawning, it, will, little, mend, the, matter, for, either, men, will, not, take, pawns, without, use, or, if, they, do, they, will, look, precisely, for, the, forfeiture, remember, a, cruel, moneyed, man, in, the, country, that, would, say, “the, devil, take, this, usury, it, keeps, us, from, forfeitures, of, mortgages, and, bonds, ”, the, third, and, last, is, that, it, is, a, vanity, to, conceive, that, there, would, be, ordinary, borrowing, without, profit, and, it, is, impossible, to, conceive, the, number, of, inconveniences, that, will, ensue, if, borrowing, be, cramped, therefore, to, speak, of, the, abolishing, of, usury, is, idle, all, states, have, ever, had, it, in, one, kind, or, rate, or, other, so, as, that, opinion, must, be, sent, to, utopia, [441], to, speak, now, of, the, reformation, and, reglement[442], of, usury, how, the, discommodities, of, it, may, be, best, avoided, and, the, commodities, retained, it, appears, by, the, balance, of, commodities, and, discommodities, of, usury, two, things, are, to, be, reconciled, the, one, that, the, tooth, of, usury, be, grinded, that, it, bite, not, too, much, the, other, that, there, be, left, open, a, means, to, invite, moneyed, men, to, lend, to, the, merchants, for, the, continuing, and, quickening, of, trade, this, cannot, be, done, except, you, introduce, two, several, sorts, of, usury, a, less, and, a, greater, for, if, you, reduce, usury, to, one, low, rate, it, will, ease, the, common, borrower, but, the, merchant, will, be, to, seek, for, money, and, it, is, to, be, noted, that, the, trade, of, merchandise, being, the, most, lucrative, may, bear, usury, at, a, good, rate, other, contracts, not, so, to, serve, both, intentions, the, way, would, be, briefly, thus, that, there, be, two, rates, of, usury, the, one, free, and, general, for, all, the, other, under, license, only, to, certain, persons, and, in, certain, places, of, merchandising, first, therefore, let, usury, in, general, be, reduced, to, five, in, the, hundred, and, let, that, rate, be, proclaimed, to, be, free, and, current, and, let, the, state, shut, itself, out, to, take, any, penalty, for, the, same, this, will, preserve, borrowing, from, any, general, stop, or, dryness, this, will, ease, infinite, borrowers, in, the, country, this, will, in, good, part, raise, the, price, of, land, because, land, purchased, at, sixteen, years’, purchase, will, yield, six, in, the, hundred, and, somewhat, more, whereas, this, rate, of, interest, yields, but, five, this, by, like, reason, will, encourage, and, edge, industrious, and, profitable, improvements, because, many, will, rather, venture, in, that, kind, than, take, five, in, the, hundred, especially, having, been, used, to, greater, profit, secondly, let, there, be, certain, persons, licensed, to, lend, to, known, merchants, upon, usury, at, a, higher, rate, and, let, it, be, with, the, cautions, following, let, the, rate, be, even, with, the, merchant, himself, somewhat, more, easy, than, that, he, used, formerly, to, pay, for, by, that, means, all, borrowers, shall, have, some, ease, by, this, reformation, be, he, merchant, or, whosoever, let, it, be, no, bank, or, common, stock, but, every, man, be, master, of, his, own, money, not, that, altogether, mislike, banks, but, they, will, hardly, be, brooked, in, regard, of, certain, suspicions, let, the, state, be, answered[443], some, small, matter, for, the, license, and, the, rest, left, to, the, lender, for, if, the, abatement, be, but, small, it, will, no, whit, discourage, the, lender, for, he, for, example, that, took, before, ten, or, nine, in, the, hundred, will, sooner, descend, to, eight, in, the, hundred, than, give, over, his, trade, of, usury, and, go, from, certain, gains, to, gains, of, hazard, let, these, licensed, lenders, be, in, number, indefinite, but, restrained, to, certain, principal, cities, and, towns, of, merchandising, for, then, they, will, be, hardly, able, to, color, other, men’s, moneys, in, the, country, so, as, the, license, of, nine, will, not, suck, away, the, current, rate, of, five, for, no, man, will, send, his, moneys, far, off, nor, put, them, into, unknown, hands, if, it, be, objected, that, this, doth, in, a, sort, authorize, usury, which, before, was, in, some, places, but, permissive, the, answer, is, that, it, is, better, to, mitigate, usury, by, declaration, than, to, suffer, it, to, rage, by, connivance, [444], man, that, is, young, in, years, may, be, old, in, hours, if, he, have, lost, no, time, but, that, happeneth, rarely, generally, youth, is, like, the, first, cogitations, not, so, wise, as, the, second, for, there, is, a, youth, in, thoughts, as, well, as, in, ages, and, yet, the, invention, of, young, men, is, more, lively, than, that, of, old, and, imaginations, stream, into, their, minds, better, and, as, it, were, more, divinely, natures, that, have, much, heat, and, great, and, violent, desires, and, perturbations, are, not, ripe, for, action, till, they, have, passed, the, meridian, of, their, years, as, it, was, with, julius, cæsar, and, septimius, severus, of, the, latter, of, whom, it, is, said, “juventutem, egit, erroribus, imo, furoribus, plenam, ”[445], and, yet, he, was, the, ablest, emperor, almost, of, all, the, list, but, reposed, natures, may, do, well, in, youth, as, it, is, seen, in, augustus, cæsar, cosmus, duke, of, florence, gaston, de, foix, [446], and, others, on, the, other, side, heat, and, vivacity, in, age, is, an, excellent, composition, for, business, young, men, are, fitter, to, invent, than, to, judge, fitter, for, execution, than, for, counsel, and, fitter, for, new, projects, than, for, settled, business, for, the, experience, of, age, in, things, that, fall, within, the, compass, of, it, directeth, them, but, in, new, things, abuseth, them, the, errors, of, young, men, are, the, ruin, of, business, but, the, errors, of, aged, men, amount, but, to, this, that, more, might, have, been, done, or, sooner, young, men, in, the, conduct, and, manage, of, actions, embrace, more, than, they, can, hold, stir, more, than, they, can, quiet, fly, to, the, end, without, consideration, of, the, means, and, degrees, pursue, some, few, principles, which, they, have, chanced, upon, absurdly, care, not, to, innovate, which, draws, unknown, inconveniences, use, extreme, remedies, at, first, and, that, which, doubleth, all, errors, will, not, acknowledge, or, retract, them, like, an, unready, horse, that, will, neither, stop, nor, turn, men, of, age, object, too, much, consult, too, long, adventure, too, little, repent, too, soon, and, seldom, drive, business, home, to, the, full, period, but, content, themselves, with, a, mediocrity, of, success, certainly, it, is, good, to, compound, employments, of, both, for, that, will, be, good, for, the, present, because, the, virtues, of, either, age, may, correct, the, defects, of, both, and, good, for, succession, that, young, men, may, be, learners, while, men, in, age, are, actors, and, lastly, good, for, externe, accidents, because, authority, followeth, old, men, and, favor, and, popularity, youth, but, for, the, moral, part, perhaps, youth, will, have, the, preëminence, as, age, hath, for, the, politic, certain, rabbin, upon, the, text, “your, young, men, shall, see, visions, and, your, old, men, shall, dream, dreams, ”[447], inferreth, that, young, men, are, admitted, nearer, to, god, than, old, because, vision, is, a, clearer, revelation, than, a, dream, and, certainly, the, more, a, man, drinketh, of, the, world, the, more, it, intoxicateth, and, age, doth, profit, rather, in, the, powers, of, understanding, than, in, the, virtues, of, the, will, and, affections, there, be, some, have, an, over-early, ripeness, in, their, years, which, fadeth, betimes, these, are, first, such, as, have, brittle, wits, the, edge, whereof, is, soon, turned, such, as, was, hermogenes[448], the, rhetorician, whose, books, are, exceedingly, subtle, who, afterwards, waxed, stupid, second, sort, is, of, those, that, have, some, natural, dispositions, which, have, better, grace, in, youth, than, in, age, such, as, is, a, fluent, and, luxuriant, speech, which, becomes, youth, well, but, not, age, so, tully, saith, of, hortensius, “idem, manebat, neque, idem, decebat, ”[449], the, third, is, of, such, as, take, too, high, a, strain, at, the, first, and, are, magnanimous, more, than, tract, of, years, can, uphold, as, was, scipio, africanus, of, whom, livy, saith, in, effect, “ultima, primis, cedebant, ”[450], virtue, is, like, a, rich, stone, best, plain, set, and, surely, virtue, is, best, in, a, body, that, is, comely, though, not, of, delicate, features, and, that, hath, rather, dignity, of, presence, than, beauty, of, aspect, neither, is, it, always, most, seen, that, very, beautiful, persons, are, otherwise, of, great, virtue, as, if, nature, were, rather, busy, not, to, err, than, in, labor, to, produce, excellency, and, therefore, they, prove, accomplished, but, not, of, great, spirit, and, study, rather, behavior, than, virtue, but, this, holds, not, always, for, augustus, cæsar, titus, vespasianus, philip, le, bel, of, france, edward, the, fourth, of, england, [451], alcibiades, of, athens, ismael, the, sophy, of, persia, were, all, high, and, great, spirits, and, yet, the, most, beautiful, men, of, their, times, in, beauty, that, of, favor, is, more, than, that, of, color, and, that, of, decent, and, gracious, motion, more, than, that, of, favor, [452], that, is, the, best, part, of, beauty, which, a, picture, cannot, express, no, nor, the, first, sight, of, the, life, there, is, no, excellent, beauty, that, hath, not, some, strangeness, in, the, proportion, man, cannot, tell, whether, apelles, or, albert, durer, were, the, more, trifler, whereof, the, one, would, make, a, personage, by, geometrical, proportions, the, other, by, taking, the, best, parts, out, of, divers, faces, to, make, one, excellent, such, personages, think, would, please, nobody, but, the, painter, that, made, them, not, but, think, a, painter, may, make, a, better, face, than, ever, was, but, he, must, do, it, by, a, kind, of, felicity, (as, a, musician, that, maketh, an, excellent, air, in, music), and, not, by, rule, man, shall, see, faces, that, if, you, examine, them, part, by, part, you, shall, find, never, a, good, and, yet, altogether, do, well, if, it, be, true, that, the, principal, part, of, beauty, is, in, decent, motion, certainly, it, is, no, marvel, though, persons, in, years, seem, many, times, more, amiable, “pulchrorum, autumnus, pulcher, ”[453], for, no, youth, can, be, comely, but, by, pardon, [454], and, considering, the, youth, as, to, make, up, the, comeliness, beauty, is, as, summer, fruits, which, are, easy, to, corrupt, and, cannot, last, and, for, the, most, part, it, makes, a, dissolute, youth, and, an, age, a, little, out, of, countenance, but, yet, certainly, again, if, it, light, well, it, maketh, virtues, shine, and, vices, blush, deformed, persons, are, commonly, even, with, nature, for, as, nature, hath, done, ill, by, them, so, do, they, by, nature, being, for, the, most, part, (as, the, scripture, saith), “void, of, natural, affection, ”[455], and, so, they, have, their, revenge, of, nature, certainly, there, is, a, consent, between, the, body, and, the, mind, and, where, nature, erreth, in, the, one, she, ventureth, in, the, other, “ubi, peccat, in, uno, periclitatur, in, altero, ”[456], but, because, there, is, in, man, an, election, touching, the, frame, of, his, mind, and, a, necessity, in, the, frame, of, his, body, the, stars, of, natural, inclination, are, sometimes, obscured, by, the, sun, of, discipline, and, virtue, therefore, it, is, good, to, consider, of, deformity, not, as, a, sign, which, is, more, deceivable, but, as, a, cause, which, seldom, faileth, of, the, effect, whosoever, hath, any, thing, fixed, in, his, person, that, doth, induce, contempt, hath, also, a, perpetual, spur, in, himself, to, rescue, and, deliver, himself, from, scorn, therefore, all, deformed, persons, are, extreme, bold, first, as, in, their, own, defence, as, being, exposed, to, scorn, but, in, process, of, time, by, a, general, habit, also, it, stirreth, in, them, industry, and, especially, of, this, kind, to, watch, and, observe, the, weakness, of, others, that, they, may, have, somewhat, to, repay, again, in, their, superiors, it, quencheth, jealousy, towards, them, as, persons, that, they, think, they, may, at, pleasure, despise, and, it, layeth, their, competitors, and, emulators, asleep, as, never, believing, they, should, be, in, possibility, of, advancement, till, they, see, them, in, possession, so, that, upon, the, matter, in, a, great, wit, deformity, is, an, advantage, to, rising, kings, in, ancient, times, (and, at, this, present, in, some, countries), were, wont, to, put, great, trust, in, eunuchs, because, they, that, are, envious, towards, all, are, more, obnoxious, and, officious, towards, one, but, yet, their, trust, towards, them, hath, rather, been, as, to, good, spials, [457], and, good, whisperers, than, good, magistrates, and, officers, and, much, like, is, the, reason, of, deformed, persons, still, the, ground, is, they, will, if, they, be, of, spirit, seek, to, free, themselves, from, scorn, which, must, be, either, by, virtue, or, malice, and, therefore, let, it, not, be, marvelled, if, sometimes, they, prove, excellent, persons, as, was, agesilaüs, zanger, the, son, of, solyman, [458], æsop, gasca, president, of, peru, and, socrates, may, go, likewise, amongst, them, with, others, houses, are, built, to, live, in, and, not, to, look, on, therefore, let, use, be, preferred, before, uniformity, except, where, both, may, be, had, leave, the, goodly, fabrics, of, houses, for, beauty, only, to, the, enchanted, palaces, of, the, poets, who, build, them, with, small, cost, he, that, builds, a, fair, house, upon, an, ill, seat, [459], committeth, himself, to, prison, neither, do, reckon, it, an, ill, seat, only, where, the, air, is, unwholesome, but, likewise, where, the, air, is, unequal, as, you, shall, see, many, fine, seats, set, upon, a, knap[460], of, ground, environed, with, higher, hills, round, about, it, whereby, the, heat, of, the, sun, is, pent, in, and, the, wind, gathereth, as, in, troughs, so, as, you, shall, have, and, that, suddenly, as, great, diversity, of, heat, and, cold, as, if, you, dwelt, in, several, places, neither, is, it, ill, air, only, that, maketh, an, ill, seat, but, ill, ways, ill, markets, and, if, you, will, consult, with, momus, [461], ill, neighbors, speak, not, of, many, more, want, of, water, want, of, wood, shade, and, shelter, want, of, fruitfulness, and, mixture, of, grounds, of, several, natures, want, of, prospect, want, of, level, grounds, want, of, places, at, some, near, distance, for, sports, of, hunting, hawking, and, races, too, near, the, sea, too, remote, having, the, commodity, of, navigable, rivers, or, the, discommodity, of, their, overflowing, too, far, off, from, great, cities, which, may, hinder, business, or, too, near, them, which, lurcheth[462], all, provisions, and, maketh, every, thing, dear, where, a, man, hath, a, great, living, laid, together, and, where, he, is, scanted, all, which, as, it, is, impossible, perhaps, to, find, together, so, it, is, good, to, know, them, and, think, of, them, that, a, man, may, take, as, many, as, he, can, and, if, he, have, several, dwellings, that, he, sort, them, so, that, what, he, wanteth, in, the, one, he, may, find, in, the, other, lucullus, answered, pompey, well, who, when, he, saw, his, stately, galleries, and, rooms, so, large, and, lightsome, in, one, of, his, houses, said, “surely, an, excellent, place, for, summer, but, how, do, you, do, in, winter, ”, lucullus, answered, “why, do, you, not, think, me, as, wise, as, some, fowls, are, that, ever, change, their, abode, towards, the, winter, ”[463], to, pass, from, the, seat, to, the, house, itself, we, will, do, as, cicero, doth, in, the, orator’s, art, who, writes, books, de, oratore, and, a, book, he, entitles, orator, whereof, the, former, delivers, the, precepts, of, the, art, and, the, latter, the, perfection, we, will, therefore, describe, a, princely, palace, making, a, brief, model, thereof, for, it, is, strange, to, see, now, in, europe, such, huge, buildings, as, the, vatican, and, escurial, [464], and, some, others, be, and, yet, scarce, a, very, fair, room, in, them, first, therefore, say, you, cannot, have, a, perfect, palace, except, you, have, two, several, sides, a, side, for, the, banquet, as, is, spoken, of, in, the, book, of, esther, [465], and, a, side, for, the, household, the, one, for, feasts, and, triumphs, and, the, other, for, dwelling, understand, both, these, sides, to, be, not, only, returns, but, parts, of, the, front, and, to, be, uniform, without, though, severally, partitioned, within, and, to, be, on, both, sides, of, a, great, and, stately, tower, in, the, midst, of, the, front, that, as, it, were, joineth, them, together, on, either, hand, would, have, on, the, side, of, the, banquet, in, front, one, only, goodly, room, above, stairs, of, some, forty, foot, high, and, under, it, a, room, for, a, dressing, or, preparing, place, at, times, of, triumphs, on, the, other, side, which, is, the, household, side, wish, it, divided, at, the, first, into, a, hall, and, a, chapel, (with, a, partition, between), both, of, good, state, and, bigness, and, those, not, to, go, all, the, length, but, to, have, at, the, further, end, a, winter, and, a, summer, parlor, both, fair, and, under, these, rooms, a, fair, and, large, cellar, sunk, under, ground, and, likewise, some, privy, kitchens, with, butteries, and, pantries, and, the, like, as, for, the, tower, would, have, it, two, stories, of, eighteen, foot, high, apiece, above, the, two, wings, and, a, goodly, leads, upon, the, top, railed, with, statues, interposed, and, the, same, tower, to, be, divided, into, rooms, as, shall, be, thought, fit, the, stairs, likewise, to, the, upper, rooms, let, them, be, upon, a, fair, open, newel, [466], and, finely, railed, in, with, images, of, wood, cast, into, a, brass, color, and, a, very, fair, landing-place, at, the, top, but, this, to, be, if, you, do, not, point, any, of, the, lower, rooms, for, a, dining-place, of, servants, for, otherwise, you, shall, have, the, servants’, dinner, after, your, own, for, the, steam, of, it, will, come, up, as, in, a, tunnel, [467], and, so, much, for, the, front, only, understand, the, height, of, the, first, stairs, to, be, sixteen, foot, which, is, the, height, of, the, lower, room, beyond, this, front, is, there, to, be, a, fair, court, but, three, sides, of, it, of, a, far, lower, building, than, the, front, and, in, all, the, four, corners, of, that, court, fair, staircases, cast, into, turrets, on, the, outside, and, not, within, the, row, of, buildings, themselves, but, those, towers, are, not, to, be, of, the, height, of, the, front, but, rather, proportionable, to, the, lower, building, let, the, court, not, be, paved, for, that, striketh, up, a, great, heat, in, summer, and, much, cold, in, winter, but, only, some, side, alleys, with, a, cross, and, the, quarters, to, graze, being, kept, shorn, but, not, too, near, shorn, the, row, of, return, on, the, banquet, side, let, it, be, all, stately, galleries, in, which, galleries, let, there, be, three, or, five, fine, cupolas, in, the, length, of, it, placed, at, equal, distance, and, fine, colored, windows, of, several, works, on, the, household, side, chambers, of, presence, and, ordinary, entertainments, with, some, bedchambers, and, let, all, three, sides, be, a, double, house, without, thorough, lights, on, the, sides, that, you, may, have, rooms, from, the, sun, both, for, forenoon, and, afternoon, cast, it, also, that, you, may, have, rooms, both, for, summer, and, winter, shady, for, summer, and, warm, for, winter, you, shall, have, sometimes, fair, houses, so, full, of, glass, that, one, cannot, tell, where, to, become[468], to, be, out, of, the, sun, or, cold, for, imbowed[469], windows, hold, them, of, good, use, (in, cities, indeed, upright[470], do, better, in, respect, of, the, uniformity, towards, the, street, ), for, they, be, pretty, retiring, places, for, conference, and, besides, they, keep, both, the, wind, and, sun, off, for, that, which, would, strike, almost, through, the, room, doth, scarce, pass, the, window, but, let, them, be, but, few, four, in, the, court, on, the, sides, only, beyond, this, court, let, there, be, an, inward, court, of, the, same, square, and, height, which, is, to, be, environed, with, the, garden, on, all, sides, and, in, the, inside, cloistered, on, all, sides, upon, decent, and, beautiful, arches, as, high, as, the, first, story, on, the, under, story, towards, the, garden, let, it, be, turned, to, grotto, or, place, of, shade, or, estivation, and, only, have, opening, and, windows, towards, the, garden, and, be, level, upon, the, floor, no, whit, sunk, under, ground, to, avoid, all, dampishness, and, let, there, be, a, fountain, or, some, fair, work, of, statues, in, the, midst, of, this, court, and, to, be, paved, as, the, other, court, was, these, buildings, to, be, for, privy, lodgings, on, both, sides, and, the, end, for, privy, galleries, whereof, you, must, foresee, that, one, of, them, be, for, an, infirmary, if, the, prince, or, any, special, person, should, be, sick, with, chambers, bedchamber, “anticamera, ”[471], and, “recamera, ”[472], joining, to, it, this, upon, the, second, story, upon, the, ground, story, a, fair, gallery, open, upon, pillars, and, upon, the, third, story, likewise, an, open, gallery, upon, pillars, to, take, the, prospect, and, freshness, of, the, garden, at, both, corners, of, the, further, side, by, way, of, return, let, there, be, two, delicate, or, rich, cabinets, daintily, paved, richly, hanged, glazed, with, crystalline, glass, and, a, rich, cupola, in, the, midst, and, all, other, elegancy, that, can, be, thought, upon, in, the, upper, gallery, too, wish, that, there, may, be, if, the, place, will, yield, it, some, fountains, running, in, divers, places, from, the, wall, with, some, fine, avoidances, [473], and, thus, much, for, the, model, of, the, palace, save, that, you, must, have, before, you, come, to, the, front, three, courts, a, green, court, plain, with, a, wall, about, it, a, second, court, of, the, same, but, more, garnished, with, little, turrets, or, rather, embellishments, upon, the, wall, and, a, third, court, to, make, a, square, with, the, front, but, not, to, be, built, nor, yet, inclosed, with, a, naked, wall, but, inclosed, with, terraces, leaded, aloft, and, fairly, garnished, on, the, three, sides, and, cloistered, on, the, inside, with, pillars, and, not, with, arches, below, as, for, offices, let, them, stand, at, distance, with, some, low, galleries, to, pass, from, them, to, the, palace, itself, god, almighty, first, planted, a, garden, and, indeed, it, is, the, purest, of, human, pleasures, it, is, the, greatest, refreshment, to, the, spirits, of, man, without, which, buildings, and, palaces, are, but, gross, handyworks, and, a, man, shall, ever, see, that, when, ages, grow, to, civility, and, elegancy, men, come, to, build, stately, sooner, than, to, garden, finely, as, if, gardening, were, the, greater, perfection, do, hold, it, in, the, royal, ordering, of, gardens, there, ought, to, be, gardens, for, all, the, months, in, the, year, in, which, severally, things, of, beauty, may, be, then, in, season, for, december, and, january, and, the, latter, part, of, november, you, must, take, such, things, as, are, green, all, winter, holly, ivy, bays, juniper, cypress-trees, yew, pineapple-trees, [474], fir-trees, rosemary, lavender, periwinkle, the, white, the, purple, and, the, blue, germander, flags, orange-trees, lemon-trees, and, myrtles, if, they, be, stoved, [475], and, sweet, marjoram, warm, set, there, followeth, for, the, latter, part, of, january, and, february, the, mezereon-tree, which, then, blossoms, crocus, vernus, both, the, yellow, and, the, gray, primroses, anemones, the, early, tulip, the, hyacinthus, orientalis, chamaïris, fritellaria, for, march, there, come, violets, especially, the, single, blue, which, are, the, earliest, the, yellow, daffodil, the, daisy, the, almond-tree, in, blossom, the, peach-tree, in, blossom, the, cornelian-tree, in, blossom, sweet-brier, in, april, follow, the, double, white, violet, the, wall-flower, the, stock-gillyflower, the, cowslip, flower-de-luces, and, lilies, of, all, natures, rosemary, flowers, the, tulip, the, double, peony, the, pale, daffodil, the, french, honeysuckle, the, cherry-tree, in, blossom, the, damascene[476], and, plum-trees, in, blossom, the, white, thorn, in, leaf, the, lilac-tree, in, may, and, june, come, pinks, of, all, sorts, especially, the, blush-pink, roses, of, all, kinds, except, the, musk, which, comes, later, honeysuckles, strawberries, bugloss, columbine, the, french, marigold, flos, africanus, cherry-tree, in, fruit, ribes, [477], figs, in, fruit, rasps, vine-flowers, lavender, in, flowers, the, sweet, satyrian, with, the, white, flower, herba, muscaria, lilium, convallium, the, apple-tree, in, blossom, in, july, come, gillyflowers, of, all, varieties, musk-roses, the, lime-tree, in, blossom, early, pears, and, plums, in, fruit, genitings, [478], codlins, in, august, come, plums, of, all, sorts, in, fruit, pears, apricots, barberries, filberts, musk-melons, monks-hoods, of, all, colors, in, september, come, grapes, apples, poppies, of, all, colors, peaches, melocotones, [479], nectarines, cornelians, [480], wardens, [481], quinces, in, october, and, the, beginning, of, november, come, services, medlars, bullaces, roses, cut, or, removed, to, come, late, hollyoaks, and, such, like, these, particulars, are, for, the, climate, of, london, but, my, meaning, is, perceived, that, you, may, have, “ver, perpetuum, ”[482], as, the, place, affords, and, because, the, breath, of, flowers, is, far, sweeter, in, the, air, (where, it, comes, and, goes, like, the, warbling, of, music), than, in, the, hand, therefore, nothing, is, more, fit, for, that, delight, than, to, know, what, be, the, flowers, and, plants, that, do, best, perfume, the, air, roses, damask, and, red, are, fast, flowers[483], of, their, smell, so, that, you, may, walk, by, a, whole, row, of, them, and, find, nothing, of, their, sweetness, yea, though, it, be, in, a, morning’s, dew, bays, likewise, yield, no, smell, as, they, grow, rosemary, little, nor, sweet, marjoram, that, which, above, all, others, yields, the, sweetest, smell, in, the, air, is, the, violet, especially, the, white, double, violet, which, comes, twice, a, year, about, the, middle, of, april, and, about, bartholomew-tide, next, to, that, is, the, musk-rose, then, the, strawberry, leaves, dying, with, a, most, excellent, cordial, smell, then, the, flower, of, the, vines, it, is, a, little, dust, like, the, dust, of, a, bent, [484], which, grows, upon, the, cluster, in, the, first, coming, forth, then, sweet-brier, then, wall-flowers, which, are, very, delightful, to, be, set, under, a, parlor, or, lower, chamber, window, then, pinks, and, gillyflowers, specially, the, matted, pink, and, clove, gillyflower, then, the, flowers, of, the, lime-tree, then, the, honeysuckles, so, they, be, somewhat, afar, off, of, bean-flowers[485], speak, not, because, they, are, field-flowers, but, those, which, perfume, the, air, most, delightfully, not, passed, by, as, the, rest, but, being, trodden, upon, and, crushed, are, three, that, is, burnet, wild, thyme, and, water-mints, therefore, you, are, to, set, whole, alleys, of, them, to, have, the, pleasure, when, you, walk, or, tread, for, gardens, (speaking, of, those, which, are, indeed, prince-like, as, we, have, done, of, buildings), the, contents, ought, not, well, to, be, under, thirty, acres, of, ground, and, to, be, divided, into, three, parts, a, green, in, the, entrance, a, heath, or, desert, in, the, going, forth, and, the, main, garden, in, the, midst, besides, alleys, on, both, sides, and, like, well, that, four, acres, of, ground, be, assigned, to, the, green, six, to, the, heath, four, and, four, to, either, side, and, twelve, to, the, main, garden, the, green, hath, two, pleasures, the, one, because, nothing, is, more, pleasant, to, the, eye, than, green, grass, kept, finely, shorn, the, other, because, it, will, give, you, a, fair, alley, in, the, midst, by, which, you, may, go, in, front, upon, a, stately, hedge, which, is, to, inclose, the, garden, but, because, the, alley, will, be, long, and, in, great, heat, of, the, year, or, day, you, ought, not, to, buy, the, shade, in, the, garden, by, going, in, the, sun, through, the, green, therefore, you, are, of, either, side, the, green, to, plant, a, covert, alley, upon, carpenter’s, work, about, twelve, foot, in, height, by, which, you, may, go, in, shade, into, the, garden, as, for, the, making, of, knots, or, figures, with, divers, colored, earths, that, they, may, lie, under, the, windows, of, the, house, on, that, side, which, the, garden, stands, they, be, but, toys, you, may, see, as, good, sights, many, times, in, tarts, the, garden, is, best, to, be, square, encompassed, on, all, the, four, sides, with, a, stately, arched, hedge, the, arches, to, be, upon, pillars, of, carpenter’s, work, of, some, ten, foot, high, and, six, foot, broad, and, the, spaces, between, of, the, same, dimension, with, the, breadth, of, the, arch, over, the, arches, let, there, be, an, entire, hedge, of, some, four, foot, high, framed, also, upon, carpenter’s, work, and, upon, the, upper, hedge, over, every, arch, a, little, turret, with, a, belly, enough, to, receive, a, cage, of, birds, and, over, every, space, between, the, arches, some, other, little, figure, with, broad, plates, of, round, colored, glass, gilt, for, the, sun, to, play, upon, but, this, hedge, intend, to, be, raised, upon, a, bank, not, steep, but, gently, slope, of, some, six, foot, set, all, with, flowers, also, understand, that, this, square, of, the, garden, should, not, be, the, whole, breadth, of, the, ground, but, to, leave, on, either, side, ground, enough, for, diversity, of, side, alleys, unto, which, the, two, covert, alleys, of, the, green, may, deliver, you, [486], but, there, must, be, no, alleys, with, hedges, at, either, end, of, this, great, inclosure, not, at, the, hither, end, for, letting[487], your, prospect, upon, this, fair, hedge, from, the, green, nor, at, the, further, end, for, letting, your, prospect, from, the, hedge, through, the, arches, upon, the, heath, for, the, ordering, of, the, ground, within, the, great, hedge, leave, it, to, variety, of, device, advising, nevertheless, that, whatsoever, form, you, cast, it, into, first, it, be, not, too, bushy, or, full, of, work, wherein, for, my, part, do, not, like, images, cut, out, in, juniper, or, other, garden, stuff, they, be, for, children, little, low, hedges, round, like, welts, with, some, pretty, pyramids, like, well, and, in, some, places, fair, columns, upon, frames, of, carpenter’s, work, would, also, have, the, alleys, spacious, and, fair, you, may, have, closer, alleys, upon, the, side, grounds, but, none, in, the, main, garden, wish, also, in, the, very, middle, a, fair, mount, with, three, ascents, and, alleys, enough, for, four, to, walk, abreast, which, would, have, to, be, perfect, circles, without, any, bulwarks, or, embossments, and, the, whole, mount, to, be, thirty, foot, high, and, some, fine, banqueting-house, with, some, chimneys, neatly, cast, and, without, too, much, glass, for, fountains, they, are, a, great, beauty, and, refreshment, but, pools, mar, all, and, make, the, garden, unwholesome, and, full, of, flies, and, frogs, fountains, intend, to, be, of, two, natures, the, one, that, sprinkleth, or, spouteth, water, the, other, a, fair, receipt, of, water, of, some, thirty, or, forty, foot, square, but, without, fish, or, slime, or, mud, for, the, first, the, ornaments, of, images, gilt, or, of, marble, which, are, in, use, do, well, but, the, main, matter, is, so, to, convey, the, water, as, it, never, stay, either, in, the, bowls, or, in, the, cistern, that, the, water, be, never, by, rest, discolored, green, or, red, or, the, like, or, gather, any, mossiness, or, putrefaction, besides, that, it, is, to, be, cleansed, every, day, by, the, hand, also, some, steps, up, to, it, and, some, fine, pavement, about, it, doth, well, as, for, the, other, kind, of, fountain, which, we, may, call, a, bathing-pool, it, may, admit, much, curiosity, and, beauty, wherewith, we, will, not, trouble, ourselves, as, that, the, bottom, be, finely, paved, and, with, images, the, sides, likewise, and, withal, embellished, with, colored, glass, and, such, things, of, lustre, encompassed, also, with, fine, rails, of, low, statues, but, the, main, point, is, the, same, that, we, mentioned, in, the, former, kind, of, fountain, which, is, that, the, water, be, in, perpetual, motion, fed, by, a, water, higher, than, the, pool, and, delivered, into, it, by, fair, spouts, and, then, discharged, away, under, ground, by, some, equality, of, bores, that, it, stay, little, and, for, fine, devices, of, arching, water[488], without, spilling, and, making, it, rise, in, several, forms, (of, feathers, drinking-glasses, canopies, and, the, like), they, be, pretty, things, to, look, on, but, nothing, to, health, and, sweetness, for, the, heath, which, was, the, third, part, of, our, plot, wish, it, to, be, framed, as, much, as, may, be, to, a, natural, wildness, trees, would, have, none, in, it, but, some, thickets, made, only, of, sweet-brier, and, honeysuckle, and, some, wild, vine, amongst, and, the, ground, set, with, violets, strawberries, and, primroses, for, these, are, sweet, and, prosper, in, the, shade, and, these, to, be, in, the, heath, here, and, there, not, in, any, order, like, also, little, heaps, in, the, nature, of, molehills, (such, as, are, in, wild, heaths), to, be, set, some, with, wild, thyme, some, with, pinks, some, with, germander, that, gives, a, good, flower, to, the, eye, some, with, periwinkle, some, with, violets, some, with, strawberries, some, with, cowslips, some, with, daisies, some, with, red, roses, some, with, lilium, convallium, [489], some, with, sweet-williams, red, some, with, bear’s-foot, and, the, like, low, flowers, being, withal, sweet, and, sightly, part, of, which, heaps, to, be, with, standards, of, little, bushes, pricked, upon, their, top, and, part, without, the, standards, to, be, roses, juniper, holly, barberries, (but, here, and, there, because, of, the, smell, of, their, blossom), red, currants, gooseberries, rosemary, bays, sweetbrier, and, such, like, but, these, standards, to, be, kept, with, cutting, that, they, grow, not, out, of, course, for, the, side, grounds, you, are, to, fill, them, with, variety, of, alleys, private, to, give, a, full, shade, some, of, them, wheresoever, the, sun, be, you, are, to, frame, some, of, them, likewise, for, shelter, that, when, the, wind, blows, sharp, you, may, walk, as, in, a, gallery, and, those, alleys, must, be, likewise, hedged, at, both, ends, to, keep, out, the, wind, and, these, closer, alleys, must, be, ever, finely, gravelled, and, no, grass, because, of, going, wet, in, many, of, these, alleys, likewise, you, are, to, set, fruit-trees, of, all, sorts, as, well, upon, the, walls, as, in, ranges, [490], and, this, should, be, generally, observed, that, the, borders, wherein, you, plant, your, fruit-trees, be, fair, and, large, and, low, and, not, steep, and, set, with, fine, flowers, but, thin, and, sparingly, lest, they, deceive[491], the, trees, at, the, end, of, both, the, side, grounds, would, have, a, mount, of, some, pretty, height, leaving, the, wall, of, the, inclosure, breast, high, to, look, abroad, into, the, fields, for, the, main, garden, do, not, deny, but, there, should, be, some, fair, alleys, ranged, on, both, sides, with, fruit-trees, and, some, pretty, tufts, of, fruit-trees, and, arbors, with, seats, set, in, some, decent, order, but, these, to, be, by, no, means, set, too, thick, but, to, leave, the, main, garden, so, as, it, be, not, close, but, the, air, open, and, free, for, as, for, shade, would, have, you, rest, upon, the, alleys, of, the, side, grounds, there, to, walk, if, you, be, disposed, in, the, heat, of, the, year, or, day, but, to, make, account[492], that, the, main, garden, is, for, the, more, temperate, parts, of, the, year, and, in, the, heat, of, summer, for, the, morning, and, the, evening, or, overcast, days, for, aviaries, like, them, not, except, they, be, of, that, largeness, as, they, may, be, turfed, and, have, living, plants, and, bushes, set, in, them, that, the, birds, may, have, more, scope, and, natural, nestling, and, that, no, foulness, appear, in, the, floor, of, the, aviary, so, have, made, a, platform, of, a, princely, garden, partly, by, precept, partly, by, drawing, not, a, model, but, some, general, lines, of, it, and, in, this, have, spared, for, no, cost, but, it, is, nothing, for, great, princes, that, for, the, most, part, taking, advice, with, workmen, with, no, less, cost, set, their, things, together, and, sometimes, add, statues, and, such, things, for, state, and, magnificence, but, nothing, to, the, true, pleasure, of, a, garden, it, is, generally, better, to, deal, by, speech, than, by, letter, and, by, the, mediation, of, a, third, than, by, a, man’s, self, letters, are, good, when, a, man, would, draw, an, answer, by, letter, back, again, or, when, it, may, serve, for, a, man’s, justification, afterwards, to, produce, his, own, letter, or, where, it, may, be, danger, to, be, interrupted, or, heard, by, pieces, to, deal, in, person, is, good, when, a, man’s, face, breedeth, regard, as, commonly, with, inferiors, or, in, tender, cases, where, a, man’s, eye, upon, the, countenance, of, him, with, whom, he, speaketh, may, give, him, a, direction, how, far, to, go, and, generally, where, a, man, will, reserve, to, himself, liberty, either, to, disavow, or, to, expound, in, choice, of, instruments, it, is, better, to, choose, men, of, a, plainer, sort, that, are, like, to, do, that, that, is, committed, to, them, and, to, report, back, again, faithfully, the, success, than, those, that, are, cunning, to, contrive, out, of, other, men’s, business, somewhat, to, grace, themselves, and, will, help, the, matter, in, report, for, satisfaction, sake, use, also, such, persons, as, affect[493], the, business, wherein, they, are, employed, for, that, quickeneth, much, and, such, as, are, fit, for, the, matter, as, bold, men, for, expostulation, fairspoken, men, for, persuasion, crafty, men, for, inquiry, and, observation, froward, and, absurd, men, for, business, that, doth, not, well, bear, out, itself, use, also, such, as, have, been, lucky, and, prevailed, before, in, things, wherein, you, have, employed, them, for, that, breeds, confidence, and, they, will, strive, to, maintain, their, prescription, it, is, better, to, sound, a, person, with, whom, one, deals, afar, off, than, to, fall, upon, the, point, at, first, except, you, mean, to, surprise, him, by, some, short, question, it, is, better, dealing, with, men, in, appetite, [494], than, with, those, that, are, where, they, would, be, if, a, man, deal, with, another, upon, conditions, the, start, of, first, performance, is, all, which, a, man, cannot, reasonably, demand, except, either, the, nature, of, the, thing, be, such, which, must, go, before, or, else, a, man, can, persuade, the, other, party, that, he, shall, still, need, him, in, some, other, thing, or, else, that, he, be, counted, the, honester, man, all, practice, is, to, discover, or, to, work, men, discover, themselves, in, trust, in, passion, at, unawares, and, of, necessity, when, they, would, have, somewhat, done, and, cannot, find, an, apt, pretext, if, you, would, work, any, man, you, must, either, know, his, nature, and, fashions, and, so, lead, him, or, his, ends, and, so, persuade, him, or, his, weakness, and, disadvantages, and, so, awe, him, or, those, that, have, interest, in, him, and, so, govern, him, in, dealing, with, cunning, persons, we, must, ever, consider, their, ends, to, interpret, their, speeches, and, it, is, good, to, say, little, to, them, and, that, which, they, least, look, for, in, all, negotiations, of, difficulty, a, man, may, not, look, to, sow, and, reap, at, once, but, must, prepare, business, and, so, ripen, it, by, degrees, costly, followers, are, not, to, be, liked, lest, while, a, man, maketh, his, train, longer, he, make, his, wings, shorter, reckon, to, be, costly, not, them, alone, which, charge, the, purse, but, which, are, wearisome, and, importune, in, suits, ordinary, followers, ought, to, challenge, no, higher, conditions, than, countenance, recommendation, and, protection, from, wrongs, factious, followers, are, worse, to, be, liked, which, follow, not, upon, affection, to, him, with, whom, they, range, themselves, but, upon, discontentment, conceived, against, some, other, whereupon, commonly, ensueth, that, ill, intelligence, that, we, many, times, see, between, great, personages, likewise, glorious[495], followers, who, make, themselves, as, trumpets, of, the, commendations, of, those, they, follow, are, full, of, inconvenience, for, they, taint, business, through, want, of, secrecy, and, they, export, honor, from, a, man, and, make, him, a, return, in, envy, there, is, a, kind, of, followers, likewise, which, are, dangerous, being, indeed, espials, which, inquire, the, secrets, of, the, house, and, bear, tales, of, them, to, others, yet, such, men, many, times, are, in, great, favor, for, they, are, officious, and, commonly, exchange, tales, the, following, by, certain, estates[496], of, men, answerable, to, that, which, a, great, person, himself, professeth, (as, of, soldiers, to, him, that, hath, been, employed, in, the, wars, and, the, like), hath, ever, been, a, thing, civil, and, well, taken, even, in, monarchies, so, it, be, without, too, much, pomp, or, popularity, but, the, most, honorable, kind, of, following, is, to, be, followed, as, one, that, apprehendeth, to, advance, virtue, and, desert, in, all, sorts, of, persons, and, yet, where, there, is, no, eminent, odds, in, sufficiency, it, is, better, to, take, with, the, more, passable, than, with, the, more, able, and, besides, to, speak, truth, in, base, times, active, men, are, of, more, use, than, virtuous, it, is, true, that, in, government, it, is, good, to, use, men, of, one, rank, equally, for, to, countenance, some, extraordinarily, is, to, make, them, insolent, and, the, rest, discontent, because, they, may, claim, a, due, but, contrariwise, in, favor, to, use, men, with, much, difference, and, election, is, good, for, it, maketh, the, persons, preferred, more, thankful, and, the, rest, more, officious, because, all, is, of, favor, it, is, good, discretion, not, to, make, too, much, of, any, man, at, the, first, because, one, cannot, hold, out, that, proportion, to, be, governed, as, we, call, it, by, one, is, not, safe, for, it, shows, softness, [497], and, gives, a, freedom, to, scandal, and, disreputation, for, those, that, would, not, censure, or, speak, ill, of, a, man, immediately, will, talk, more, boldly, of, those, that, are, so, great, with, them, and, thereby, wound, their, honor, yet, to, be, distracted, with, many, is, worse, for, it, makes, men, to, be, of, the, last, impression, and, full, of, change, to, take, advice, of, some, few, friends, is, ever, honorable, for, lookers-on, many, times, see, more, than, gamesters, and, the, vale, best, discovereth, the, hill, there, is, little, friendship, in, the, world, and, least, of, all, between, equals, which, was, wont[498], to, be, magnified, that, that, is, is, between, superior, and, inferior, [499], whose, fortunes, may, comprehend, the, one, the, other, many, ill, matters, and, projects, are, undertaken, and, private, suits, do, putrefy, the, public, good, many, good, matters, are, undertaken, with, bad, minds, mean, not, only, corrupt, minds, but, crafty, minds, that, intend, not, performance, some, embrace, suits, which, never, mean, to, deal, effectually, in, them, but, if, they, see, there, may, be, life, in, the, matter, by, some, other, mean, they, will, be, content, to, win, a, thank, or, take, a, second, reward, or, at, least, to, make, use, in, the, mean, time, of, the, suitor’s, hopes, some, take, hold, of, suits, only, for, an, occasion, to, cross, some, other, or, to, make, an, information, whereof, they, could, not, otherwise, have, apt, pretext, without, care, what, become, of, the, suit, when, that, turn, is, served, or, generally, to, make, other, men’s, business, a, kind, of, entertainment, to, bring, in, their, own, nay, some, undertake, suits, with, a, full, purpose, to, let, them, fall, to, the, end, to, gratify, the, adverse, party, or, competitor, surely, there, is, in, some, sort, a, right, in, every, suit, either, a, right, of, equity, if, it, be, a, suit, of, controversy, or, a, right, of, desert, if, it, be, a, suit, of, petition, if, affection, lead, a, man, to, favor, the, wrong, side, in, justice, let, him, rather, use, his, countenance, to, compound, the, matter, than, to, carry, it, if, affection, lead, a, man, to, favor, the, less, worthy, in, desert, let, him, do, it, without, depraving[500], or, disabling, the, better, deserver, in, suits, which, a, man, doth, not, well, understand, it, is, good, to, refer, them, to, some, friend, of, trust, and, judgment, that, may, report, whether, he, may, deal, in, them, with, honor, but, let, him, choose, well, his, referendaries, [501], for, else, he, may, be, led, by, the, nose, suitors, are, so, distasted[502], with, delays, and, abuses, that, plain, dealing, in, denying, to, deal, in, suits, at, first, and, reporting, the, success, barely, [503], and, in, challenging, no, more, thanks, than, one, hath, deserved, is, grown, not, only, honorable, but, also, gracious, in, suits, of, favor, the, first, coming, ought, to, take, little, place, [504], so, far, forth[505], consideration, may, be, had, of, his, trust, that, if, intelligence, of, the, matter, could, not, otherwise, have, been, had, but, by, him, advantage, be, not, taken, of, the, note, [506], but, the, party, left, to, his, other, means, and, in, some, sort, recompensed, for, his, discovery, to, be, ignorant, of, the, value, of, a, suit, is, simplicity, as, well, as, to, be, ignorant, of, the, right, thereof, is, want, of, conscience, secrecy, in, suits, is, a, great, mean, of, obtaining, for, voicing, them, to, be, in, forwardness, may, discourage, some, kind, of, suitors, but, doth, quicken, and, awake, others, but, timing, of, the, suit, is, the, principal, timing, say, not, only, in, respect, of, the, person, that, should, grant, it, but, in, respect, of, those, which, are, like, to, cross, it, let, a, man, in, the, choice, of, his, mean, rather, choose, the, fittest, mean, than, the, greatest, mean, and, rather, them, that, deal, in, certain, things, than, those, that, are, general, the, reparation, of, a, denial, is, sometimes, equal, to, the, first, grant, if, a, man, show, himself, neither, dejected, nor, discontented, “iniquum, petas, ut, æquum, feras, ”[507], is, a, good, rule, where, a, man, hath, strength, of, favor, but, otherwise, a, man, were, better, rise, in, his, suit, for, he, that, would, have, ventured, at, first, to, have, lost, the, suitor, will, not, in, the, conclusion, lose, both, the, suitor, and, his, own, former, favor, nothing, is, thought, so, easy, a, request, to, a, great, person, as, his, letter, and, yet, if, it, be, not, in, a, good, cause, it, is, so, much, out, of, his, reputation, there, are, no, worse, instruments, than, these, general, contrivers, of, suits, for, they, are, but, a, kind, of, poison, and, infection, to, public, proceedings, [508], studies, serve, for, delight, for, ornament, and, for, ability, their, chief, use, for, delight, is, in, privateness, and, retiring, for, ornament, is, in, discourse, and, for, ability, is, in, the, judgment, and, disposition, of, business, for, expert, men, can, execute, and, perhaps, judge, of, particulars, one, by, one, but, the, general, counsels, and, the, plots, and, marshalling, of, affairs, come, best, from, those, that, are, learned, to, spend, too, much, time, in, studies, is, sloth, to, use, them, too, much, for, ornament, is, affectation, to, make, judgment, wholly, by, their, rules, is, the, humor, of, a, scholar, they, perfect, nature, and, are, perfected, by, experience, for, natural, abilities, are, like, natural, plants, that, need, pruning, by, study, and, studies, themselves, do, give, forth, directions, too, much, at, large, except, they, be, bounded, in, by, experience, crafty, men, contemn, studies, simple, men, admire, them, and, wise, men, use, them, for, they, teach, not, their, own, use, but, that, is, a, wisdom, without, them, and, above, them, won, by, observation, read, not, to, contradict, and, confute, nor, to, believe, and, take, for, granted, nor, to, find, talk, and, discourse, but, to, weigh, and, consider, some, books, are, to, be, tasted, others, to, be, swallowed, and, some, few, to, be, chewed, and, digested, that, is, some, books, are, to, be, read, only, in, parts, others, to, be, read, but, not, curiously, [509], and, some, few, to, be, read, wholly, and, with, diligence, and, attention, some, books, also, may, be, read, by, deputy, and, extracts, made, of, them, by, others, but, that, would, be, only, in, the, less, important, arguments, and, the, meaner, sort, of, books, else, distilled, books, are, like, common, distilled, waters, flashy[510], things, reading, maketh, a, full, man, conference, a, ready, man, and, writing, an, exact, man, and, therefore, if, a, man, write, little, he, had, need, have, a, great, memory, if, he, confer, little, he, had, need, have, a, present, wit, and, if, he, read, little, he, had, need, have, much, cunning, to, seem, to, know, that, he, doth, not, histories, make, men, wise, poets, witty, the, mathematics, subtile, natural, philosophy, deep, moral, grave, logic, and, rhetoric, able, to, contend, “abeunt, studia, in, mores, ”[511], nay, there, is, no, stand, or, impediment, in, the, wit, but, may, be, wrought, out, by, fit, studies, like, as, diseases, of, the, body, may, have, appropriate, exercises, bowling, is, good, for, the, stone, and, reins, shooting, for, the, lungs, and, breast, gentle, walking, for, the, stomach, riding, for, the, head, and, the, like, so, if, a, man’s, wit, be, wandering, let, him, study, the, mathematics, for, in, demonstrations, if, his, wit, be, called, away, never, so, little, he, must, begin, again, if, his, wit, be, not, apt, to, distinguish, or, find, difference, let, him, study, the, schoolmen, for, they, are, “cymini, sectores, ”[512], if, he, be, not, apt, to, beat, over, matters, and, to, call, up, one, thing, to, prove, and, illustrate, another, let, him, study, the, lawyers’, cases, so, every, defect, of, the, mind, may, have, a, special, receipt, many, have, an, opinion, not, wise, that, for, a, prince, to, govern, his, estate, or, for, a, great, person, to, govern, his, proceedings, according, to, the, respect, of, factions, is, a, principal, part, of, policy, whereas, contrariwise, the, chiefest, wisdom, is, either, in, ordering, those, things, which, are, general, and, wherein, men, of, several, factions, do, nevertheless, agree, or, in, dealing, with, correspondence, to, particular, persons, one, by, one, but, say, not, that, the, consideration, of, factions, is, to, be, neglected, mean, men, in, their, rising, must, adhere, but, great, men, that, have, strength, in, themselves, were, better, to, maintain, themselves, indifferent, and, neutral, yet, even, in, beginners, to, adhere, so, moderately, as, he, be, a, man, of, the, one, faction, which, is, most, passable, with, the, other, commonly, giveth, best, way, the, lower, and, weaker, faction, is, the, firmer, in, conjunction, and, it, is, often, seen, that, a, few, that, are, stiff, do, tire, out, a, great, number, that, are, more, moderate, when, one, of, the, factions, is, extinguished, the, remaining, subdivideth, as, the, faction, between, lucullus, and, the, rest, of, the, nobles, of, the, senate, (which, they, called, “optimates”), held, out, a, while, against, the, faction, of, pompey, and, cæsar, but, when, the, senate’s, authority, was, pulled, down, cæsar, and, pompey, soon, after, brake, the, faction, or, party, of, antonius, and, octavianus, cæsar, against, brutus, and, cassius, held, out, likewise, for, a, time, but, when, brutus, and, cassius, were, overthrown, then, soon, after, antonius, and, octavianus, brake, and, subdivided, these, examples, are, of, wars, but, the, same, holdeth, in, private, factions, and, therefore, those, that, are, seconds, in, factions, do, many, times, when, the, faction, subdivideth, prove, principals, but, many, times, also, they, prove, ciphers, and, cashiered, for, many, a, man’s, strength, is, in, opposition, and, when, that, faileth, he, groweth, out, of, use, it, is, commonly, seen, that, men, once, placed, take, in, with, the, contrary, faction, to, that, by, which, they, enter, thinking, belike, that, they, have, the, first, sure, and, now, are, ready, for, a, new, purchase, the, traitor, in, faction, lightly, goeth, away, with, it, for, when, matters, have, stuck, long, in, balancing, the, winning, of, some, one, man, casteth, them, [513], and, he, getteth, all, the, thanks, the, even, carriage, between, two, factions, proceedeth, not, always, of, moderation, but, of, a, trueness, to, a, man’s, self, with, end, to, make, use, of, both, certainly, in, italy, they, hold, it, a, little, suspect, in, popes, when, they, have, often, in, their, mouth, “padre, commune, ”[514], and, take, it, to, be, a, sign, of, one, that, meaneth, to, refer, all, to, the, greatness, of, his, own, house, kings, had, need, beware, how, they, side, themselves, and, make, themselves, as, of, a, faction, or, party, for, leagues, within, the, state, are, ever, pernicious, to, monarchies, for, they, raise, an, obligation, paramount, to, obligation, of, sovereignty, and, make, the, king, “tanquam, unus, ex, nobis, ”[515], as, was, to, be, seen, in, the, league, of, france, when, factions, are, carried, too, high, and, too, violently, it, is, a, sign, of, weakness, in, princes, and, much, to, the, prejudice, both, of, their, authority, and, business, the, motions, of, factions, under, kings, ought, to, be, like, the, motions, (as, the, astronomers, speak), of, the, inferior, orbs, which, may, have, their, proper, motions, but, yet, still, are, quietly, carried, by, the, higher, motion, of, “primum, mobile, ”[516], he, that, is, only, real, had, need, have, exceeding, great, parts, of, virtue, as, the, stone, had, need, to, be, rich, that, is, set, without, foil, but, if, a, man, mark, it, well, it, is, in, praise, and, commendation, of, men, as, it, is, in, gettings, and, gains, for, the, proverb, is, true, that, “light, gains, make, heavy, purses, ”, for, light, gains, come, thick, whereas, great, come, but, now, and, then, so, it, is, true, that, small, matters, win, great, commendation, because, they, are, continually, in, use, and, in, note, whereas, the, occasion, of, any, great, virtue, cometh, but, on, festivals, therefore, it, doth, much, add, to, a, man’s, reputation, and, is, (as, queen, isabella[517], said), like, perpetual, letters, commendatory, to, have, good, forms, to, attain, them, it, almost, sufficeth, not, to, despise, them, for, so, shall, a, man, observe, them, in, others, and, let, him, trust, himself, with, the, rest, for, if, he, labor, too, much, to, express, them, he, shall, lose, their, grace, which, is, to, be, natural, and, unaffected, some, men’s, behavior, is, like, a, verse, wherein, every, syllable, is, measured, how, can, a, man, comprehend, great, matters, that, breaketh, his, mind, too, much, to, small, observations, not, to, use, ceremonies, at, all, is, to, teach, others, not, to, use, them, again, and, so, diminisheth, respect, to, himself, especially, they, be, not, to, be, omitted, to, strangers, and, formal, natures, but, the, dwelling, upon, them, and, exalting, them, above, the, moon, is, not, only, tedious, but, doth, diminish, the, faith, and, credit, of, him, that, speaks, and, certainly, there, is, a, kind, of, conveying, of, effectual, and, imprinting, passages, amongst, compliments, which, is, of, singular, use, if, a, man, can, hit, upon, it, amongst, a, man’s, peers, a, man, shall, be, sure, of, familiarity, and, therefore, it, is, good, a, little, to, keep, state, amongst, a, man’s, inferiors, one, shall, be, sure, of, reverence, and, therefore, it, is, good, a, little, to, be, familiar, he, that, is, too, much, in, any, thing, so, that, he, giveth, another, occasion, of, satiety, maketh, himself, cheap, to, apply, one’s, self, to, others, is, good, so, it, be, with, demonstration, that, a, man, doth, it, upon, regard, and, not, upon, facility, it, is, a, good, precept, generally, in, seconding, another, yet, to, add, somewhat, of, one’s, own, as, if, you, will, grant, his, opinion, let, it, be, with, some, distinction, if, you, will, follow, his, motion, let, it, be, with, condition, if, you, allow, his, counsel, let, it, be, with, alleging, further, reason, men, had, need, beware, how, they, be, too, perfect, in, compliments, for, be, they, never, so, sufficient, otherwise, their, enviers, will, be, sure, to, give, them, that, attribute, to, the, disadvantage, of, their, greater, virtues, it, is, loss, also, in, business, to, be, too, full, of, respects, or, to, be, too, curious, in, observing, times, and, opportunities, solomon, saith, “he, that, considereth, the, wind, shall, not, sow, and, he, that, looketh, to, the, clouds, shall, not, reap, ”[518], wise, man, will, make, more, opportunities, than, he, finds, men’s, behavior, should, be, like, their, apparel, not, too, strait, or, point, device, [519], but, free, for, exercise, or, motion, praise, is, the, reflection, of, virtue, but, it, is, glass, or, body, which, giveth, the, reflection, if, it, be, from, the, common, people, it, is, commonly, false, and, naught, and, rather, followeth, vain, persons, than, virtuous, for, the, common, people, understand, not, many, excellent, virtues, the, lowest, virtues, draw, praise, from, them, the, middle, virtues, work, in, them, astonishment, or, admiration, but, of, the, highest, virtues, they, have, no, sense, or, perceiving, at, all, but, shows, and, “species, virtutibus, similes, ”[520], serve, best, with, them, certainly, fame, is, like, a, river, that, beareth, up, things, light, and, swollen, and, drowns, things, weighty, and, solid, but, if, persons, of, quality, and, judgment, concur, then, it, is, (as, the, scripture, saith), “nomen, bonum, instar, unguenti, fragrantis, ”[521], it, filleth, all, round, about, and, will, not, easily, away, for, the, odors, of, ointments, are, more, durable, than, those, of, flowers, there, be, so, many, false, points, of, praise, that, a, man, may, justly, hold, it, a, suspect, some, praises, proceed, merely, of, flattery, and, if, he, be, an, ordinary, flatterer, he, will, have, certain, common, attributes, which, may, serve, every, man, if, he, be, a, cunning, flatterer, he, will, follow, the, arch-flatterer, which, is, a, man’s, self, and, wherein, a, man, thinketh, best, of, himself, therein, the, flatterer, will, uphold, him, most, but, if, he, be, an, impudent, flatterer, look, wherein, a, man, is, conscious, to, himself, that, he, is, most, defective, and, is, most, out, of, countenance, in, himself, that, will, the, flatterer, entitle, him, to, perforce, “spretâ, conscientiâ, ”[522], some, praises, come, of, good, wishes, and, respects, which, is, a, form, due, in, civility, to, kings, and, great, persons, “laudando, præcipere, ”[523], when, by, telling, men, what, they, are, they, represent, to, them, what, they, should, be, some, men, are, praised, maliciously, to, their, hurt, thereby, to, stir, envy, and, jealousy, towards, them, “pessimum, genus, inimicorum, laudantium, ”[524], insomuch, as, it, was, a, proverb, amongst, the, grecians, that, “he, that, was, praised, to, his, hurt, should, have, a, push[525], rise, upon, his, nose, ”, as, we, say, that, a, blister, will, rise, upon, one’s, tongue, that, tells, a, lie, certainly, moderate, praise, used, with, opportunity, and, not, vulgar, is, that, which, doth, the, good, solomon, saith, “he, that, praiseth, his, friend, aloud, rising, early, it, shall, be, to, him, no, better, than, a, curse, ”[526], too, much, magnifying, of, man, or, matter, doth, irritate, contradiction, and, procure, envy, and, scorn, to, praise, a, man’s, self, cannot, be, decent, except, it, be, in, rare, cases, but, to, praise, a, man’s, office[527], or, profession, he, may, do, it, with, good, grace, and, with, a, kind, of, magnanimity, the, cardinals, of, rome, which, are, theologues, [528], and, friars, and, schoolmen, have, a, phrase, of, notable, contempt, and, scorn, towards, civil, business, for, they, call, all, temporal, business, of, wars, embassages, judicature, and, other, employments, sbirrerie, which, is, under-sheriffries, as, if, they, were, but, matters, for, under-sheriffs, and, catchpoles, though, many, times, those, under-sheriffries, do, more, good, than, their, high, speculations, st, paul, when, he, boasts, of, himself, he, doth, oft, interlace, speak, like, a, fool, ”[529], but, speaking, of, his, calling, he, saith, “magnificabo, apostolatum, meum, ”[530], it, was, prettily, devised, of, æsop, the, fly, sat, upon, the, axle-tree, of, the, chariot-wheel, and, said, “what, a, dust, do, raise, ”, so, are, there, some, vain, persons, that, whatsoever, goeth, alone, or, moveth, upon, greater, means, if, they, have, never, so, little, hand, in, it, they, think, it, is, they, that, carry, it, they, that, are, glorious, must, needs, be, factious, for, all, bravery[531], stands, upon, comparisons, they, must, needs, be, violent, to, make, good, their, own, vaunts, neither, can, they, be, secret, and, therefore, not, effectual, but, according, to, the, french, proverb, “beaucoup, de, bruit, peu, de, fruit, ”—“much, bruit, [532], little, fruit, ”, yet, certainly, there, is, use, of, this, quality, in, civil, affairs, where, there, is, an, opinion[533], and, fame, to, be, created, either, of, virtue, or, greatness, these, men, are, good, trumpeters, again, as, titus, livius, noteth, in, the, case, of, antiochus, and, the, ætolians, [534], there, are, sometimes, great, effects, of, cross, lies, as, if, a, man, that, negotiates, between, two, princes, to, draw, them, to, join, in, a, war, against, the, third, doth, extol, the, forces, of, either, of, them, above, measure, the, one, to, the, other, and, sometimes, he, that, deals, between, man, and, man, raiseth, his, own, credit, with, both, by, pretending, greater, interest, than, he, hath, in, either, and, in, these, and, the, like, kinds, it, often, falls, out, that, somewhat, is, produced, of, nothing, for, lies, are, sufficient, to, breed, opinion, and, opinion, brings, on, substance, in, military, commanders, and, soldiers, vainglory, is, an, essential, point, for, as, iron, sharpens, iron, so, by, glory, one, courage, sharpeneth, another, in, cases, of, great, enterprise, upon, charge[535], and, adventure, a, composition, of, glorious, natures, doth, put, life, into, business, and, those, that, are, of, solid, and, sober, natures, have, more, of, the, ballast, than, of, the, sail, in, fame, of, learning, the, flight, will, be, slow, without, some, feathers, of, ostentation, “qui, de, contemnendâ, gloriâ, libros, scribunt, nomen, suum, inscribunt, ”[536], socrates, aristotle, galen, were, men, full, of, ostentation, certainly, vainglory, helpeth, to, perpetuate, a, man’s, memory, and, virtue, was, never, so, beholden, to, human, nature, as, it, received, its, due, at, the, second, hand, neither, had, the, fame, of, cicero, seneca, plinius, secundus, [537], borne, her, age, so, well, if, it, had, not, been, joined, with, some, vanity, in, themselves, like, unto, varnish, that, makes, ceilings, not, only, shine, but, last, but, all, this, while, when, speak, of, vainglory, mean, not, of, that, property, that, tacitus, doth, attribute, to, mucianus, “omnium, quæ, dixerat, feceratque, arte, quâdam, ostentator, ”[538], for, that[539], proceeds, not, of, vanity, but, of, natural, magnanimity, and, discretion, and, in, some, persons, is, not, only, comely, but, gracious, for, excusations, [540], cessions, [541], modesty, itself, well, governed, are, but, arts, of, ostentation, and, amongst, those, arts, there, is, none, better, than, that, which, plinius, secundus, speaketh, of, which, is, to, be, liberal, of, praise, and, commendation, to, others, in, that, wherein, a, man’s, self, hath, any, perfection, for, saith, pliny, very, wittily, “in, commending, another, you, do, yourself, right, [542], for, he, that, you, commend, is, either, superior, to, you, in, that, you, commend, or, inferior, if, he, be, inferior, if, he, be, to, be, commended, you, much, more, if, he, be, superior, if, he, be, not, to, be, commended, you, much, less, ”, glorious[543], men, are, the, scorn, of, wise, men, the, admiration, of, fools, the, idols, of, parasites, and, the, slaves, of, their, own, vaunts, the, winning, of, honor, is, but, the, revealing, of, a, man’s, virtue, and, worth, without, disadvantage, for, some, in, their, actions, do, woo, and, affect, honor, and, reputation, which, sort, of, men, are, commonly, much, talked, of, but, inwardly, little, admired, and, some, contrariwise, darken, their, virtue, in, the, show, of, it, so, as, they, be, undervalued, in, opinion, if, a, man, perform, that, which, hath, not, been, attempted, before, or, attempted, and, given, over, or, hath, been, achieved, but, not, with, so, good, circumstance, he, shall, purchase, more, honor, than, by, affecting, a, matter, of, greater, difficulty, or, virtue, wherein, he, is, but, a, follower, if, a, man, so, temper, his, actions, as, in, some, one, of, them, he, doth, content, every, faction, or, combination, of, people, the, music, will, be, the, fuller, man, is, an, ill, husband, of, his, honor, that, entereth, into, any, action, the, failing, wherein, may, disgrace, him, more, than, the, carrying, of, it, through, can, honor, him, honor, that, is, gained, and, broken, upon, another, hath, the, quickest, reflection, like, diamonds, cut, with, facets, and, therefore, let, a, man, contend, to, excel, any, competitors, of, his, in, honor, in, outshooting, them, if, he, can, in, their, own, bow, discreet, followers, and, servants, help, much, to, reputation, “omnis, fama, a, domesticis, emanat, ”[544], envy, which, is, the, canker, of, honor, is, best, extinguished, by, declaring, a, man’s, self, in, his, ends, rather, to, seek, merit, than, fame, and, by, attributing, a, man’s, successes, rather, to, divine, providence, and, felicity, than, to, his, own, virtue, or, policy, the, true, marshalling, of, the, degrees, of, sovereign, honor, are, these, in, the, first, place, are, “conditores, imperiorum, ”[545], founders, of, states, and, commonwealths, such, as, were, romulus, cyrus, cæsar, ottoman, [546], ismael, in, the, second, place, are, “legislatores, ”, lawgivers, which, are, also, called, second, founders, or, “perpetui, principes, ”[547], because, they, govern, by, their, ordinances, after, they, are, gone, such, were, lycurgus, solon, justinian, edgar, [548], alphonsus, of, castile, the, wise, that, made, the, “siete, partidas, ”[549], in, the, third, place, are, “liberatores, ”, or, “salvatores, ”[550], such, as, compound, the, long, miseries, of, civil, wars, or, deliver, their, countries, from, servitude, of, strangers, or, tyrants, as, augustus, cæsar, vespasianus, aurelianus, theodoricus, king, henry, the, seventh, of, england, king, henry, the, fourth, of, france, in, the, fourth, place, are, “propagatores, ”, or, “propugnatores, imperii, ”[551], such, as, in, honorable, wars, enlarge, their, territories, or, make, noble, defence, against, invaders, and, in, the, last, place, are, “patres, patriæ, ”[552], which, reign, justly, and, make, the, times, good, wherein, they, live, both, which, last, kinds, need, no, examples, they, are, in, such, number, degrees, of, honor, in, subjects, are, first, “participes, curarum, ”[553], those, upon, whom, princes, do, discharge, the, greatest, weight, of, their, affairs, their, right, hands, as, we, call, them, the, next, are, “duces, belli, ”[554], great, leaders, such, as, are, princes’, lieutenants, and, do, them, notable, services, in, the, wars, the, third, are, “gratiosi, ”, favorites, such, as, exceed, not, this, scantling, [555], to, be, solace, to, the, sovereign, and, harmless, to, the, people, and, the, fourth, “negotiis, pares, ”[556], such, as, have, great, places, under, princes, and, execute, their, places, with, sufficiency, there, is, an, honor, likewise, which, may, be, ranked, amongst, the, greatest, which, happeneth, rarely, that, is, of, such, as, sacrifice, themselves, to, death, or, danger, for, the, good, of, their, country, as, was, regulus, and, the, two, decii, judges, ought, to, remember, that, their, office, is, “jus, dicere, ”[557], and, not, “jus, dare, ”[558], to, interpret, law, and, not, to, make, law, or, give, law, else, will, it, be, like, the, authority, claimed, by, the, church, of, rome, which, under, pretext, of, exposition, of, scripture, doth, not, stick, to, add, and, alter, and, to, pronounce, that, which, they, do, not, find, and, by, show, of, antiquity, to, introduce, novelty, judges, ought, to, be, more, learned, than, witty, more, reverend, than, plausible, and, more, advised, than, confident, above, all, things, integrity, is, their, portion, and, proper, virtue, “cursed, (saith, the, law)[559], is, he, that, removeth, the, landmark, ”, the, mislayer, of, a, mere, stone, is, to, blame, but, it, is, the, unjust, judge, that, is, the, capital, remover, of, landmarks, when, he, defineth, amiss, of, lands, and, property, one, foul, sentence, doth, more, hurt, than, many, foul, examples, for, these, do, but, corrupt, the, stream, the, other, corrupteth, the, fountain, so, saith, solomon, “fons, turbatus, et, vena, corrupta, est, justus, cadens, in, causâ, suâ, coram, adversario, ”[560], the, office, of, judges, may, have, reference, unto, the, parties, that, sue, unto, the, advocates, that, plead, unto, the, clerks, and, ministers, of, justice, underneath, them, and, to, the, sovereign, or, state, above, them, first, for, the, causes, or, parties, that, sue, “there, be, (saith, the, scripture), that, turn, judgment, into, wormwood, ”[561], and, surely, there, be, also, that, turn, it, into, vinegar, for, injustice, maketh, it, bitter, and, delays, make, it, sour, the, principal, duty, of, a, judge, is, to, suppress, force, and, fraud, whereof, force, is, the, more, pernicious, when, it, is, open, and, fraud, when, it, is, close, and, disguised, add, thereto, contentious, suits, which, ought, to, be, spewed, out, as, the, surfeit, of, courts, judge, ought, to, prepare, his, way, to, a, just, sentence, as, god, useth, to, prepare, his, way, by, raising, valleys, and, taking, down, hills, so, when, there, appeareth, on, either, side, a, high, hand, violent, prosecution, cunning, advantages, taken, combination, power, great, counsel, then, is, the, virtue, of, a, judge, seen, to, make, inequality, equal, that, he, may, plant, his, judgment, as, upon, an, even, ground, “qui, fortiter, emungit, elicit, sanguinem, ”[562], and, where, the, wine-press, is, hard, wrought, it, yields, a, harsh, wine, that, tastes, of, the, grape-stone, judges, must, beware, of, hard, constructions, and, strained, inferences, for, there, is, no, worse, torture, than, the, torture, of, laws, especially, in, case, of, laws, penal, they, ought, to, have, care, that, that, which, was, meant, for, terror, be, not, turned, into, rigor, and, that, they, bring, not, upon, the, people, that, shower, whereof, the, scripture, speaketh, “pluet, super, eos, laqueos, ”[563], for, penal, laws, pressed, [564], are, a, shower, of, snares, upon, the, people, therefore, let, penal, laws, if, they, have, been, sleepers, of, long, or, if, they, be, grown, unfit, for, the, present, time, be, by, wise, judges, confined, in, the, execution, “judicis, officium, est, ut, res, ita, tempora, rerum, ”, &c, [565], in, causes, of, life, and, death, judges, ought, (as, far, as, the, law, permitteth), in, justice, to, remember, mercy, and, to, cast, a, severe, eye, upon, the, example, but, a, merciful, eye, upon, the, person, secondly, for, the, advocates, and, counsel, that, plead, patience[566], and, gravity, of, hearing, is, an, essential, part, of, justice, and, an, overspeaking, judge, is, no, well-tuned, cymbal, it, is, no, grace, to, a, judge, first, to, find, that, which, he, might, have, heard, in, due, time, from, the, bar, or, to, show, quickness, of, conceit, in, cutting, off, evidence, or, counsel, too, short, or, to, prevent, information, by, questions, though, pertinent, the, parts, of, a, judge, in, hearing, are, four, to, direct, the, evidence, to, moderate, length, repetition, of, impertinency, of, speech, to, recapitulate, select, and, collate, the, material, points, of, that, which, hath, been, said, and, to, give, the, rule, or, sentence, whatsoever, is, above, these, is, too, much, and, proceedeth, either, of, glory, and, willingness, to, speak, or, of, impatience, to, hear, or, of, shortness, of, memory, or, of, want, of, a, staid, and, equal, attention, it, is, a, strange, thing, to, see, that, the, boldness, of, advocates, should, prevail, with, judges, whereas, they, should, imitate, god, in, whose, seat, they, sit, who, represseth, the, presumptuous, and, giveth, grace, to, the, modest, but, it, is, more, strange, that, judges, should, have, noted, favorites, which, cannot, but, cause, multiplication, of, fees, and, suspicion, of, by-ways, there, is, due, from, the, judge, to, the, advocate, some, commendation, and, gracing, where, causes, are, well, handled, and, fair, pleaded, especially, towards, the, side, which, obtaineth, not, [567], for, that, upholds, in, the, client, the, reputation, of, his, counsel, and, beats, down, in, him, the, conceit[568], of, his, cause, there, is, likewise, due, to, the, public, a, civil, reprehension, of, advocates, where, there, appeareth, cunning, counsel, gross, neglect, slight, information, indiscreet, pressing, or, an, over-bold, defence, and, let, not, the, counsel, at, the, bar, chop[569], with, the, judge, nor, wind, himself, into, the, handling, of, the, cause, anew, after, the, judge, hath, declared, his, sentence, but, on, the, other, side, let, not, the, judge, meet, the, cause, half-way, nor, give, occasion, to, the, party, to, say, his, counsel, or, proofs, were, not, heard, thirdly, for, that, that, concerns, clerks, and, ministers, the, place, of, justice, is, a, hallowed, place, and, therefore, not, only, the, bench, but, the, foot-pace, and, precincts, and, purprise, thereof, ought, to, be, preserved, without, scandal, and, corruption, for, certainly, “grapes, (as, the, scripture, saith), will, not, be, gathered, of, thorns, or, thistles, ”[570], neither, can, justice, yield, her, fruit, with, sweetness, amongst, the, briers, and, brambles, of, catching, and, polling[571], clerks, and, ministers, the, attendance, of, courts, is, subject, to, four, bad, instruments, first, certain, persons, that, are, sowers, of, suits, which, make, the, court, swell, and, the, country, pine, the, second, sort, is, of, those, that, engage, courts, in, quarrels, of, jurisdiction, and, are, not, truly, “amici, curiæ, ”[572], but, “parasiti, curiæ, ”[573], in, puffing, a, court, up, beyond, her, bounds, for, their, own, scraps, and, advantage, the, third, sort, is, of, those, that, may, be, accounted, the, left, hands, of, courts, persons, that, are, full, of, nimble, and, sinister, tricks, and, shifts, whereby, they, pervert, the, plain, and, direct, courses, of, courts, and, bring, justice, into, oblique, lines, and, labyrinths, and, the, fourth, is, the, poller, and, exacter, of, fees, which, justifies, the, common, resemblance, of, the, courts, of, justice, to, the, bush, whereunto, while, the, sheep, flies, for, defence, in, weather, he, is, sure, to, lose, part, of, his, fleece, on, the, other, side, an, ancient, clerk, skilful, in, precedents, wary, in, proceeding, and, understanding, in, the, business, of, the, court, is, an, excellent, finger, of, a, court, and, doth, many, times, point, the, way, to, the, judge, himself, fourthly, for, that, which, may, concern, the, sovereign, and, estate, judges, ought, above, all, to, remember, the, conclusion, of, the, roman, twelve, tables, [574], “salus, populi, suprema, lex, ”[575], and, to, know, that, laws, except, they, be, in, order, to, that, end, are, but, things, captious, and, oracles, not, well, inspired, therefore, it, is, a, happy, thing, in, a, state, when, kings, and, states, do, often, consult, with, judges, and, again, when, judges, do, often, consult, with, the, king, and, state, the, one, when, there, is, matter, of, law, intervenient, in, business, of, state, the, other, when, there, is, some, consideration, of, state, intervenient, in, matter, of, law, for, many, times, the, things, deduced, to, judgment, may, be, “meum”[576], and, “tuum, ”[577], when, the, reason, and, consequence, thereof, may, trench, to, point, of, estate, call, matter, of, estate, not, only, the, parts, of, sovereignty, but, whatsoever, introduceth, any, great, alteration, or, dangerous, precedent, or, concerneth, manifestly, any, great, portion, of, people, and, let, no, man, weakly, conceive, that, just, laws, and, true, policy, have, any, antipathy, for, they, are, like, the, spirits, and, sinews, that, one, moves, with, the, other, let, judges, also, remember, that, solomon’s, throne, was, supported, by, lions[578], on, both, sides, let, them, be, lions, but, yet, lions, under, the, throne, being, circumspect, that, they, do, not, check, or, oppose, any, points, of, sovereignty, let, not, judges, also, be, so, ignorant, of, their, own, right, as, to, think, there, is, not, left, to, them, as, a, principal, part, of, their, office, a, wise, use, and, application, of, laws, for, they, may, remember, what, the, apostle, saith, of, a, greater, law, than, theirs, “nos, scimus, quia, lex, bona, est, modo, quis, eâ, utatur, legitime, ”[579], to, seek, to, extinguish, anger, utterly, is, but, a, bravery[580], of, the, stoics, we, have, better, oracles, “be, angry, but, sin, not, let, not, the, sun, go, down, upon, your, anger, ”[581], anger, must, be, limited, and, confined, both, in, race, and, in, time, we, will, first, speak, how, the, natural, inclination, and, habit, “to, be, angry, ”, may, be, attempered, and, calmed, secondly, how, the, particular, motions, of, anger, may, be, repressed, or, at, least, refrained, from, doing, mischief, thirdly, how, to, raise, anger, or, appease, anger, in, another, for, the, first, there, is, no, other, way, but, to, meditate, and, ruminate, well, upon, the, effects, of, anger, how, it, troubles, man’s, life, and, the, best, time, to, do, this, is, to, look, back, upon, anger, when, the, fit, is, thoroughly, over, seneca, saith, well, “that, anger, is, like, ruin, which, breaks, itself, upon, that, it, falls, ”[582], the, scripture, exhorteth, us, “to, possess, our, souls, in, patience, ”[583], whosoever, is, out, of, patience, is, out, of, possession, of, his, soul, men, must, not, turn, bees, —, “animasque, in, vulnere, ponunt, ”[584], anger, is, certainly, a, kind, of, baseness, as, it, appears, well, in, the, weakness, of, those, subjects, in, whom, it, reigns, children, women, old, folks, sick, folks, only, men, must, beware, that, they, carry, their, anger, rather, with, scorn, than, with, fear, so, that, they, may, seem, rather, to, be, above, the, injury, than, below, it, which, is, a, thing, easily, done, if, a, man, will, give, law, to, himself, in, it, for, the, second, point, the, causes, and, motives, of, anger, are, chiefly, three, first, to, be, too, sensible, of, hurt, for, no, man, is, angry, that, feels, not, himself, hurt, and, therefore, tender, and, delicate, persons, must, needs, be, oft, angry, they, have, so, many, things, to, trouble, them, which, more, robust, natures, have, little, sense, of, the, next, is, the, apprehension, and, construction, of, the, injury, offered, to, be, in, the, circumstances, thereof, full, of, contempt, for, contempt, is, that, which, putteth, an, edge, upon, anger, as, much, or, more, than, the, hurt, itself, and, therefore, when, men, are, ingenious, in, picking, out, circumstances, of, contempt, they, do, kindle, their, anger, much, lastly, opinion, of, the, touch[585], of, a, man’s, reputation, doth, multiply, and, sharpen, anger, wherein, the, remedy, is, that, a, man, should, have, as, gonsalvo, was, wont, to, say, “telam, honoris, crassiorem, ”[586], but, in, all, refrainings, of, anger, it, is, the, best, remedy, to, win, time, and, to, make, a, man’s, self, believe, that, the, opportunity, of, his, revenge, is, not, yet, come, but, that, he, foresees, a, time, for, it, and, so, to, still, himself, in, the, mean, time, and, reserve, it, to, contain, anger, from, mischief, though, it, take, hold, of, a, man, there, be, two, things, whereof, you, must, have, special, caution, the, one, of, extreme, bitterness, of, words, especially, if, they, be, aculeate, and, proper, [587], for, “communia, maledicta”[588], are, nothing, so, much, and, again, that, in, anger, a, man, reveal, no, secrets, for, that, makes, him, not, fit, for, society, the, other, that, you, do, not, peremptorily, break, off, in, any, business, in, a, fit, of, anger, but, howsoever, you, show, bitterness, do, not, act, any, thing, that, is, not, revocable, for, raising, and, appeasing, anger, in, another, it, is, done, chiefly, by, choosing, of, times, when, men, are, frowardest, and, worst, disposed, to, incense, them, again, by, gathering, (as, was, touched, before), all, that, you, can, find, out, to, aggravate, the, contempt, and, the, two, remedies, are, by, the, contraries, the, former, to, take, good, times, when, first, to, relate, to, a, man, an, angry, business, for, the, first, impression, is, much, and, the, other, is, to, sever, as, much, as, may, be, the, construction, of, the, injury, from, the, point, of, contempt, imputing, it, to, misunderstanding, fear, passion, or, what, you, will, solomon, saith, “there, is, no, new, thing, upon, the, earth, ”[589], so, that, as, plato[590], had, an, imagination, that, all, knowledge, was, but, remembrance, so, solomon, giveth, his, sentence, “that, all, novelty, is, but, oblivion, ”[591], whereby, you, may, see, that, the, river, of, lethe, runneth, as, well, above, ground, as, below, there, is, an, abstruse, astrologer, that, saith, if, it, were, not, for, two, things, that, are, constant, (the, one, is, that, the, fixed, stars, ever, stand, at, like, distance, one, from, another, and, never, come, nearer, together, nor, go, further, asunder, the, other, that, the, diurnal, motion, perpetually, keepeth, time), no, individual, would, last, one, moment, certain, it, is, that, the, matter, is, in, a, perpetual, flux, and, never, at, a, stay, the, great, winding-sheets, that, bury, all, things, in, oblivion, are, two, —deluges, and, earthquakes, as, for, conflagrations, and, great, droughts, they, do, not, merely, dispeople, but, destroy, phaeton’s, car, went, but, a, day, and, the, three, years’, drought, in, the, time, of, elias, [592], was, but, particular, [593], and, left, people, alive, as, for, the, great, burnings, by, lightnings, which, are, often, in, the, west, indies, [594], they, are, but, narrow, [595], but, in, the, other, two, destructions, by, deluge, and, earthquake, it, is, further, to, be, noted, that, the, remnant, of, people, which, happen, to, be, reserved, are, commonly, ignorant, and, mountainous, people, that, can, give, no, account, of, the, time, past, so, that, the, oblivion, is, all, one, as, if, none, had, been, left, if, you, consider, well, of, the, people, of, the, west, indies, it, is, very, probable, that, they, are, a, newer, or, a, younger, people, than, the, people, of, the, old, world, and, it, is, much, more, likely, that, the, destruction, that, hath, heretofore, been, there, was, not, by, earthquakes, (as, the, egyptian, priest, told, solon, concerning, the, island, of, atlantis, [596], that, it, was, swallowed, by, an, earthquake), but, rather, that, it, was, desolated, by, a, particular, deluge, for, earthquakes, are, seldom, in, those, parts, but, on, the, other, side, they, have, such, pouring, rivers, as, the, rivers, of, asia, and, africa, and, europe, are, but, brooks, to, them, their, andes, likewise, or, mountains, are, far, higher, than, those, with, us, whereby, it, seems, that, the, remnants, of, generations, of, men, were, in, such, a, particular, deluge, saved, as, for, the, observation, that, machiavel, hath, that, the, jealousy, of, sects, doth, much, extinguish, the, memory, of, things, [597], traducing, gregory, the, great, that, he, did, what, in, him, lay, to, extinguish, all, heathen, antiquities, do, not, find, that, those, zeals, do, any, great, effects, nor, last, long, as, it, appeared, in, the, succession, of, sabinian, [598], who, did, revive, the, former, antiquities, the, vicissitude, or, mutations, in, the, superior, globe, are, no, fit, matter, for, this, present, argument, it, may, be, plato’s, great, year, [599], if, the, world, should, last, so, long, would, have, some, effect, not, in, renewing, the, state, of, like, individuals, (for, that, is, the, fume[600], of, those, that, conceive, the, celestial, bodies, have, more, accurate, influences, upon, these, things, below, than, indeed, they, have), but, in, gross, comets, out, of, question, have, likewise, power, and, effect, over, the, gross, and, mass, of, things, but, they, are, rather, gazed, and, waited, upon[601], in, their, journey, than, wisely, observed, in, their, effects, especially, in, their, respective, effects, that, is, what, kind, of, comet, for, magnitude, color, version, of, the, beams, placing, in, the, region, of, heaven, or, lasting, produceth, what, kind, of, effects, there, is, a, toy, [602], which, have, heard, and, would, not, have, it, given, over, but, waited, upon, a, little, they, say, it, is, observed, in, the, low, countries, know, not, in, what, part), that, every, five, and, thirty, years, the, same, kind, and, suit, of, years, and, weather, comes, about, again, as, great, frosts, great, wet, great, droughts, warm, winters, summers, with, little, heat, and, the, like, and, they, call, it, the, prime, it, is, a, thing, do, the, rather, mention, because, computing, backwards, have, found, some, concurrence, but, to, leave, these, points, of, nature, and, to, come, to, men, the, greatest, vicissitude, of, things, amongst, men, is, the, vicissitude, of, sects, and, religions, for, those, orbs, rule, in, men’s, minds, most, the, true, religion, is, built, upon, the, rock, the, rest, are, tossed, upon, the, waves, of, time, to, speak, therefore, of, the, causes, of, new, sects, and, to, give, some, counsel, concerning, them, as, far, as, the, weakness, of, human, judgment, can, give, stay, to, so, great, revolutions, when, the, religion, formerly, received, is, rent, by, discords, and, when, the, holiness, of, the, professors, of, religion, is, decayed, and, full, of, scandal, and, withal, the, times, be, stupid, ignorant, and, barbarous, you, may, doubt, the, springing, up, of, a, new, sect, if, then, also, there, should, arise, any, extravagant, and, strange, spirit, to, make, himself, author, thereof, all, which, points, held, when, mahomet, published, his, law, if, a, new, sect, have, not, two, properties, fear, it, not, for, it, will, not, spread, the, one, is, the, supplanting, or, the, opposing, of, authority, established, for, nothing, is, more, popular, than, that, the, other, is, the, giving, license, to, pleasures, and, a, voluptuous, life, for, as, for, speculative, heresies, (such, as, were, in, ancient, times, the, arians, and, now, the, arminians), [603], though, they, work, mightily, upon, men’s, wits, yet, they, do, not, produce, any, great, alterations, in, states, except, it, be, by, the, help, of, civil, occasions, there, be, three, manner, of, plantations, of, new, sects, by, the, power, of, signs, and, miracles, by, the, eloquence, and, wisdom, of, speech, and, persuasion, and, by, the, sword, for, martyrdoms, reckon, them, amongst, miracles, because, they, seem, to, exceed, the, strength, of, human, nature, and, may, do, the, like, of, superlative, and, admirable, holiness, of, life, surely, there, is, no, better, way, to, stop, the, rising, of, new, sects, and, schisms, than, to, reform, abuses, to, compound, the, smaller, differences, to, proceed, mildly, and, not, with, sanguinary, persecutions, and, rather, to, take, off, the, principal, authors, by, winning, and, advancing, them, than, to, enrage, them, by, violence, and, bitterness, the, changes, and, vicissitude, in, wars, are, many, but, chiefly, in, three, things, in, the, seats, or, stages, of, the, war, in, the, weapons, and, in, the, manner, of, the, conduct, wars, in, ancient, time, seemed, more, to, move, from, east, to, west, for, the, persians, assyrians, arabians, tartars, (which, were, the, invaders), were, all, eastern, people, it, is, true, the, gauls, were, western, but, we, read, but, of, two, incursions, of, theirs, the, one, to, gallo-græcia, the, other, to, rome, but, east, and, west, have, no, certain, points, of, heaven, and, no, more, have, the, wars, either, from, the, east, or, west, any, certainty, of, observation, but, north, and, south, are, fixed, and, it, hath, seldom, or, never, been, seen, that, the, far, southern, people, have, invaded, the, northern, but, contrariwise, whereby, it, is, manifest, that, the, northern, tract, of, the, world, is, in, nature, the, more, martial, region, be, it, in, respect, of, the, stars, of, that, hemisphere, [604], or, of, the, great, continents, that, are, upon, the, north, whereas, the, south, part, for, aught, that, is, known, is, almost, all, sea, or, (which, is, most, apparent), of, the, cold, of, the, northern, parts, which, is, that, which, without, aid, of, discipline, doth, make, the, bodies, hardest, and, the, courage, warmest, upon, the, breaking, and, shivering, of, a, great, state, and, empire, you, may, be, sure, to, have, wars, for, great, empires, while, they, stand, do, enervate, and, destroy, the, forces, of, the, natives, which, they, have, subdued, resting, upon, their, own, protecting, forces, and, then, when, they, fail, also, all, goes, to, ruin, and, they, become, a, prey, so, was, it, in, the, decay, of, the, roman, empire, and, likewise, in, the, empire, of, almaigne, [605], after, charles, the, great, [606], every, bird, taking, a, feather, and, were, not, unlike, to, befall, to, spain, if, it, should, break, the, great, accessions, and, unions, of, kingdoms, do, likewise, stir, up, wars, for, when, a, state, grows, to, an, over-power, it, is, like, a, great, flood, that, will, be, sure, to, overflow, as, it, hath, been, seen, in, the, states, of, rome, turkey, spain, and, others, look, when, the, world, hath, fewest, barbarous, people, but, such, as, commonly, will, not, marry, or, generate, except, they, know, means, to, live, (as, it, is, almost, everywhere, at, this, day, except, tartary), there, is, no, danger, of, inundations, of, people, but, when, there, be, great, shoals, of, people, which, go, on, to, populate, without, foreseeing, means, of, life, and, sustenation, it, is, of, necessity, that, once, in, an, age, or, two, they, discharge, a, portion, of, their, people, upon, other, nations, which, the, ancient, northern, people, were, wont, to, do, by, lot, casting, lots, what, part, should, stay, at, home, and, what, should, seek, their, fortunes, when, a, warlike, state, grows, soft, and, effeminate, they, may, be, sure, of, a, war, for, commonly, such, states, are, grown, rich, in, the, time, of, their, degenerating, and, so, the, prey, inviteth, and, their, decay, in, valor, encourageth, a, war, as, for, the, weapons, it, hardly, falleth, under, rule, and, observation, yet, we, see, even, they, have, returns, and, vicissitudes, for, certain, it, is, that, ordnance, was, known, in, the, city, of, the, oxidraces, in, india, and, was, that, which, the, macedonians[607], called, thunder, and, lightning, and, magic, and, it, is, well, known, that, the, use, of, ordnance, hath, been, in, china, above, two, thousand, years, the, conditions, of, weapons, and, their, improvements, are, first, the, fetching[608], afar, off, for, that, outruns, the, danger, as, it, is, seen, in, ordnance, and, muskets, secondly, the, strength, of, the, percussion, wherein, likewise, ordnance, do, exceed, all, arietations, [609], and, ancient, inventions, the, third, is, the, commodious, use, of, them, as, that, they, may, serve, in, all, weathers, that, the, carriage, may, be, light, and, manageable, and, the, like, for, the, conduct, of, the, war, at, the, first, men, rested, extremely, upon, number, they, did, put, the, wars, likewise, upon, main, force, and, valor, pointing, days, for, pitched, fields, and, so, trying, it, out, upon, an, even, match, and, they, were, more, ignorant, in, ranging, and, arraying, their, battles, after, they, grew, to, rest, upon, number, rather, competent, than, vast, they, grew, to, advantages, of, place, cunning, diversions, and, the, like, and, they, grew, more, skilful, in, the, ordering, of, their, battles, in, the, youth, of, a, state, arms, do, flourish, in, the, middle, age, of, a, state, learning, and, then, both, of, them, together, for, a, time, in, the, declining, age, of, a, state, mechanical, arts, and, merchandise, learning, hath, its, infancy, when, it, is, but, beginning, and, almost, childish, then, its, youth, when, it, is, luxuriant, and, juvenile, then, its, strength, of, years, when, it, is, solid, and, reduced, and, lastly, its, old, age, when, it, waxeth, dry, and, exhaust, but, it, is, not, good, to, look, too, long, upon, these, turning, wheels, of, vicissitude, lest, we, become, giddy, as, for, the, philology, of, them, that, is, but, a, circle, of, tales, and, therefore, not, fit, for, this, writing, [610], the, poets, make, fame, a, monster, they, describe, her, in, part, finely, and, elegantly, and, in, part, gravely, and, sententiously, they, say, look, how, many, feathers, she, hath, so, many, eyes, she, hath, underneath, so, many, tongues, so, many, voices, she, pricks, up, so, many, ears, this, is, a, flourish, there, follow, excellent, parables, as, that, she, gathereth, strength, in, going, that, she, goeth, upon, the, ground, and, yet, hideth, her, head, in, the, clouds, that, in, the, daytime, she, sitteth, in, a, watch-tower, and, flieth, most, by, night, that, she, mingleth, things, done, with, things, not, done, and, that, she, is, a, terror, to, great, cities, but, that, which, passeth, all, the, rest, is, they, do, recount, that, the, earth, mother, of, the, giants, that, made, war, against, jupiter, and, were, by, him, destroyed, thereupon, in, anger, brought, forth, fame, for, certain, it, is, that, rebels, figured, by, the, giants, and, seditious, fames, and, libels, are, but, brothers, and, sisters, masculine, and, feminine, but, now, if, a, man, can, tame, this, monster, and, bring, her, to, feed, at, the, hand, and, govern, her, and, with, her, fly, other, ravening, fowl, and, kill, them, it, is, somewhat, worth, but, we, are, infected, with, the, style, of, the, poets, to, speak, now, in, a, sad, and, serious, manner, there, is, not, in, all, the, politics, a, place, less, handled, and, more, worthy, to, be, handled, than, this, of, fame, we, will, therefore, speak, of, these, points, what, are, false, fames, and, what, are, true, fames, and, how, they, may, be, best, discerned, how, fames, may, be, sown, and, raised, how, they, may, be, spread, and, multiplied, and, how, they, may, be, checked, and, lay, dead, and, other, things, concerning, the, nature, of, fame, fame, is, of, that, force, as, there, is, scarcely, any, great, action, wherein, it, hath, not, a, great, part, especially, in, the, war, mucianus, undid, vitellius, by, a, fame, that, he, scattered, that, vitellius, had, in, purpose, to, remove, the, legions, of, syria, into, germany, and, the, legions, of, germany, into, syria, whereupon, the, legions, of, syria, were, infinitely, inflamed, [611], julius, cæsar, took, pompey, unprovided, and, laid, asleep, his, industry, and, preparations, by, a, fame, that, he, cunningly, gave, out, how, cæsar’s, own, soldiers, loved, him, not, and, being, wearied, with, the, wars, and, laden, with, the, spoils, of, gaul, would, forsake, him, as, soon, as, he, came, into, italy, [612], livia, settled, all, things, for, the, succession, of, her, son, tiberius, by, continually, giving, out, that, her, husband, augustus, was, upon, recovery, and, amendment, [613], and, it, is, a, usual, thing, with, the, bashaws, to, conceal, the, death, of, the, grand, turk, from, the, janizaries, and, men, of, war, to, save, the, sacking, of, constantinople, and, other, towns, as, their, manner, is, themistocles, made, xerxes, king, of, persia, post, apace, out, of, græcia, by, giving, out, that, the, grecians, had, a, purpose, to, break, his, bridge, of, ships, which, he, had, made, athwart, hellespont, [614], there, be, a, thousand, such, like, examples, and, the, more, they, are, the, less, they, need, to, be, repeated, because, a, man, meeteth, with, them, everywhere, therefore, let, all, wise, governors, have, as, great, a, watch, and, care, over, fames, as, they, have, of, the, actions, and, designs, themselves, king, is, a, mortal, god, on, earth, unto, whom, the, living, god, hath, lent, his, own, name, as, a, great, honor, but, withal, told, him, he, should, die, like, a, man, lest, he, should, be, proud, and, flatter, himself, that, god, hath, with, his, name, imparted, unto, him, his, nature, also, of, all, kind, of, men, god, is, the, least, beholden, unto, them, for, he, doth, most, for, them, and, they, do, ordinarily, least, for, him, king, that, would, not, feel, his, crown, too, heavy, for, him, must, wear, it, every, day, but, if, he, think, it, too, light, he, knoweth, not, of, what, metal, it, is, made, he, must, make, religion, the, rule, of, government, and, not, to, balance, the, scale, for, he, that, casteth, in, religion, only, to, make, the, scales, even, his, own, weight, is, contained, in, those, characters, “mene, mene, tekel, upharsin, he, is, found, too, light, his, kingdom, shall, be, taken, from, him, ”, and, that, king, that, holds, not, religion, the, best, reason, of, state, is, void, of, all, piety, and, justice, the, supporters, of, a, king, he, must, be, able, to, give, counsel, himself, but, not, rely, thereupon, for, though, happy, events, justify, their, counsels, yet, it, is, better, that, the, evil, event, of, good, advice, be, rather, imputed, to, a, subject, than, a, sovereign, he, is, a, fountain, of, honor, which, should, not, run, with, a, waste-pipe, lest, the, courtiers, sell, the, water, and, then, as, papists, say, of, their, holy, wells, it, loses, the, virtue, he, is, the, life, of, the, law, not, only, as, he, is, _lex, loquens_, himself, but, because, he, animateth, the, dead, letter, making, it, active, towards, all, his, subjects, _præmio, et, pœna_, wise, king, must, do, less, in, altering, his, laws, than, he, may, for, new, government, is, ever, dangerous, it, being, true, in, the, body, politic, as, in, the, corporal, that, _omnis, subita, immutatio, est, periculosa_, and, though, it, be, for, the, better, yet, it, is, not, without, a, fearful, apprehension, for, he, that, changeth, the, fundamental, laws, of, a, kingdom, thinketh, there, is, no, good, title, to, a, crown, but, by, conquest, king, that, setteth, to, sale, seats, of, justice, oppresseth, the, people, for, he, teacheth, his, judges, to, sell, justice, and, _pretio, parata, pretio, venditur, justitia_, bounty, and, magnificence, are, virtues, very, regal, but, a, prodigal, king, is, nearer, a, tyrant, than, a, parsimonious, for, store, at, home, draweth, not, his, contemplations, abroad, but, want, supplieth, itself, of, what, is, next, and, many, times, the, next, way, king, therein, must, be, wise, and, know, what, he, may, justly, do, that, king, which, is, not, feared, is, not, loved, and, he, that, is, well, seen, in, his, craft, must, as, well, study, to, be, feared, as, loved, yet, not, loved, for, fear, but, feared, for, love, therefore, as, he, must, always, resemble, him, whose, great, name, he, beareth, and, that, as, in, manifesting, the, sweet, influence, of, his, mercy, on, the, severe, stroke, of, his, justice, sometimes, so, in, this, not, to, suffer, a, man, of, death, to, live, for, besides, that, the, land, doth, mourn, the, restraint, of, justice, towards, sin, doth, more, retard, the, affection, of, love, than, the, extent, of, mercy, doth, inflame, it, and, sure, where, love, is, [ill], bestowed, fear, is, quite, lost, his, greatest, enemies, are, his, flatterers, for, though, they, ever, speak, on, his, side, yet, their, words, still, make, against, him, the, love, which, a, king, oweth, to, a, weal, public, should, not, be, overstrained, to, any, one, particular, yet, that, his, more, especial, favor, do, reflect, upon, some, worthy, ones, is, somewhat, necessary, because, there, are, few, of, that, capacity, he, must, have, a, special, care, of, five, things, if, he, would, not, have, his, crown, to, be, but, to, him, _infelix, felicitas_, first, that, _simulata, sanctitas_, be, not, in, the, church, for, that, is, _duplex, iniquitas_, secondly, that, _inutilis, æquitas_, sit, not, in, the, chancery, for, that, is, _inepta, misericordia_, thirdly, that, _utilis, iniquitas_, keep, not, the, exchequer, for, that, is, _crudele, latrocinium_, fourthly, that, _fidelis, temeritas_, be, not, his, general, for, that, will, bring, but, _seram, pœnitentiam_, fifthly, that, _infidelis, prudentia_, be, not, his, secretary, for, that, is, _anguis, sub, viridi, herbâ_, to, conclude, as, he, is, of, the, greatest, power, so, he, is, subject, to, the, greatest, cares, made, the, servant, of, his, people, or, else, he, were, without, a, calling, at, all, he, then, that, honoreth, him, not, is, next, an, atheist, wanting, the, fear, of, god, in, his, heart, have, often, thought, upon, death, and, find, it, the, least, of, all, evils, all, that, which, is, past, is, as, a, dream, and, he, that, hopes, or, depends, upon, time, coming, dreams, waking, so, much, of, our, life, as, we, have, discovered, is, already, dead, and, all, those, hours, which, we, share, even, from, the, breasts, of, our, mothers, until, we, return, to, our, grandmother, the, earth, are, part, of, our, dying, days, whereof, even, this, is, one, and, those, that, succeed, are, of, the, same, nature, for, we, die, daily, and, as, others, have, given, place, to, us, so, we, must, in, the, end, give, way, to, others, physicians, in, the, name, of, death, include, all, sorrow, anguish, disease, calamity, or, whatsoever, can, fall, in, the, life, of, man, either, grievous, or, unwelcome, but, these, things, are, familiar, unto, us, and, we, suffer, them, every, hour, therefore, we, die, daily, and, am, older, since, affirmed, it, know, many, wise, men, that, fear, to, die, for, the, change, is, bitter, and, flesh, would, refuse, to, prove, it, besides, the, expectation, brings, terror, and, that, exceeds, the, evil, but, do, not, believe, that, any, man, fears, to, be, dead, but, only, the, stroke, of, death, and, such, are, my, hopes, that, if, heaven, be, pleased, and, nature, renew, but, my, lease, for, twenty-one, years, more, without, asking, longer, days, shall, be, strong, enough, to, acknowledge, without, mourning, that, was, begotten, mortal, virtue, walks, not, in, the, highway, though, she, go, _per, alta_, this, is, strength, and, the, blood, to, virtue, to, contemn, things, that, be, desired, and, to, neglect, that, which, is, feared, why, should, man, be, in, love, with, his, fetters, though, of, gold, art, thou, drowned, in, security, then, say, thou, art, perfectly, dead, for, though, thou, movest, yet, thy, soul, is, buried, within, thee, and, thy, good, angel, either, forsakes, his, guard, or, sleeps, there, is, nothing, under, heaven, saving, a, true, friend, (who, cannot, be, counted, within, the, number, of, movables), unto, which, my, heart, doth, lean, and, this, dear, freedom, hath, begotten, me, this, peace, that, mourn, not, for, that, end, which, must, be, nor, spend, one, wish, to, have, one, minute, added, to, the, uncertain, date, of, my, years, it, was, no, mean, apprehension, of, lucian, who, says, of, menippus, that, in, his, travels, through, hell, he, knew, not, the, kings, of, the, earth, from, other, men, but, only, by, their, louder, cryings, and, tears, which, were, fostered, in, them, through, the, remorseful, memory, of, the, good, days, they, had, seen, and, the, fruitful, havings, which, they, so, unwillingly, left, behind, them, he, that, was, well, seated, looked, back, at, his, portion, and, was, loath, to, forsake, his, farm, and, others, either, minding, marriages, pleasures, profit, or, preferment, desired, to, be, excused, from, death’s, banquet, they, had, made, an, appointment, with, earth, looking, at, the, blessings, not, the, hand, that, enlarged, them, forgetting, how, unclothedly, they, came, hither, or, with, what, naked, ornaments, they, were, arrayed, but, were, we, servants, of, the, precept, given, and, observers, of, the, heathens’, rule, _memento, mori_, and, not, become, benighted, with, this, seeming, felicity, we, should, enjoy, it, as, men, prepared, to, lose, and, not, wind, up, our, thoughts, upon, so, perishing, a, fortune, he, that, is, not, slackly, strong, (as, the, servants, of, pleasure), how, can, he, be, found, unready, to, quit, the, vail, and, false, visage, of, his, perfection, the, soul, having, shaken, off, her, flesh, doth, then, set, up, for, herself, and, contemning, things, that, are, under, shows, what, finger, hath, enforced, her, for, the, souls, of, idiots, are, of, the, same, piece, with, those, of, statesmen, but, now, and, then, nature, is, at, a, fault, and, this, good, guest, of, ours, takes, soil, in, an, imperfect, body, and, so, is, slackened, from, showing, her, wonders, like, an, excellent, musician, which, cannot, utter, himself, upon, a, defective, instrument, but, see, how, am, swerved, and, lose, my, course, touching, at, the, soul, that, doth, least, hold, action, with, death, who, hath, the, surest, property, in, this, frail, act, his, style, is, the, end, of, all, flesh, and, the, beginning, of, incorruption, this, ruler, of, monuments, leads, men, for, the, most, part, out, of, this, world, with, their, heels, forward, in, token, that, he, is, contrary, to, life, which, being, obtained, sends, men, headlong, into, this, wretched, theatre, where, being, arrived, their, first, language, is, that, of, mourning, nor, in, my, own, thoughts, can, compare, men, more, fitly, to, any, thing, than, to, the, indian, fig-tree, which, being, ripened, to, his, full, height, is, said, to, decline, his, branches, down, to, the, earth, whereof, she, conceives, again, and, they, become, roots, in, their, own, stock, so, man, having, derived, his, being, from, the, earth, first, lives, the, life, of, a, tree, drawing, his, nourishment, as, a, plant, and, made, ripe, for, death, he, tends, downwards, and, is, sown, again, in, his, mother, the, earth, where, he, perisheth, not, but, expects, a, quickening, so, we, see, death, exempts, not, a, man, from, being, but, only, presents, an, alteration, yet, there, are, some, men, think), that, stand, otherwise, persuaded, death, finds, not, a, worse, friend, than, an, alderman, to, whose, door, never, knew, him, welcome, but, he, is, an, importunate, guest, and, will, not, be, said, nay, and, though, they, themselves, shall, affirm, that, they, are, not, within, yet, the, answer, will, not, be, taken, and, that, which, heightens, their, fear, is, that, they, know, they, are, in, danger, to, forfeit, their, flesh, but, are, not, wise, of, the, payment-day, which, sickly, uncertainty, is, the, occasion, that, (for, the, most, part), they, step, out, of, this, world, unfurnished, for, their, general, account, and, being, all, unprovided, desire, yet, to, hold, their, gravity, preparing, their, souls, to, answer, in, scarlet, thus, gather, that, death, is, unagreeable, to, most, citizens, because, they, commonly, die, intestate, this, being, a, rule, that, when, their, will, is, made, they, think, themselves, nearer, a, grave, than, before, now, they, out, of, the, wisdom, of, thousands, think, to, scare, destiny, from, which, there, is, no, appeal, by, not, making, a, will, or, to, live, longer, by, protestation, of, their, unwillingness, to, die, they, are, for, the, most, part, well, made, in, this, world, (accounting, their, treasure, by, legions, as, men, do, devils), their, fortune, looks, towards, them, and, they, are, willing, to, anchor, at, it, and, desire, (if, it, be, possible), to, put, the, evil, day, far, off, from, them, and, to, adjourn, their, ungrateful, and, killing, period, no, these, are, not, the, men, which, have, bespoken, death, or, whose, looks, are, assured, to, entertain, a, thought, of, him, death, arrives, gracious, only, to, such, as, sit, in, darkness, or, lie, heavy, burdened, with, grief, and, irons, to, the, poor, christian, that, sits, bound, in, the, galley, to, despairful, widows, pensive, prisoners, and, deposed, kings, to, them, whose, fortune, runs, back, and, whose, spirits, mutiny, unto, such, death, is, a, redeemer, and, the, grave, a, place, for, retiredness, and, rest, these, wait, upon, the, shore, of, death, and, waft, unto, him, to, draw, near, wishing, above, all, others, to, see, his, star, that, they, might, be, led, to, his, place, wooing, the, remorseless, sisters, to, wind, down, the, watch, of, their, life, and, to, break, them, off, before, the, hour, but, death, is, a, doleful, messenger, to, a, usurer, and, fate, untimely, cuts, their, thread, for, it, is, never, mentioned, by, him, but, when, rumors, of, war, and, civil, tumults, put, him, in, mind, thereof, and, when, many, hands, are, armed, and, the, peace, of, a, city, in, disorder, and, the, foot, of, the, common, soldiers, sounds, an, alarm, on, his, stairs, then, perhaps, such, a, one, (broken, in, thoughts, of, his, moneys, abroad, and, cursing, the, monuments, of, coin, which, are, in, his, house), can, be, content, to, think, of, death, and, (being, hasty, of, perdition), will, perhaps, hang, himself, lest, his, throat, should, be, cut, provided, that, he, may, do, it, in, his, study, surrounded, with, wealth, to, which, his, eye, sends, a, faint, and, languishing, salute, even, upon, the, turning, off, remembering, always, that, he, have, time, and, liberty, by, writing, to, depute, himself, as, his, own, heir, for, that, is, a, great, peace, to, his, end, and, reconciles, him, wonderfully, upon, the, point, herein, we, all, dally, with, ourselves, and, are, without, proof, of, necessity, am, not, of, those, that, dare, promise, to, pine, away, myself, in, vainglory, and, hold, such, to, be, but, feat, boldness, and, them, that, dare, commit, it, to, be, vain, yet, for, my, part, think, nature, should, do, me, great, wrong, if, should, be, so, long, in, dying, as, was, in, being, born, to, speak, truth, no, man, knows, the, lists, of, his, own, patience, nor, can, divine, how, able, he, shall, be, in, his, sufferings, till, the, storm, come, (the, perfectest, virtue, being, tried, in, action), but, would, (out, of, a, care, to, do, the, best, business, well), ever, keep, a, guard, and, stand, upon, keeping, faith, and, a, good, conscience, and, if, wishes, might, find, place, would, die, together, and, not, my, mind, often, and, my, body, once, that, is, would, prepare, for, the, messengers, of, death, sickness, and, affliction, and, not, wait, long, or, be, attempted, by, the, violence, of, pain, herein, do, not, profess, myself, a, stoic, to, hold, grief, no, evil, but, opinion, and, a, thing, indifferent, but, consent, with, cæsar, that, the, suddenest, passage, is, easiest, and, there, is, nothing, more, awakens, our, resolve, and, readiness, to, die, than, the, quieted, conscience, strengthened, with, opinion, that, we, shall, be, well, spoken, of, upon, earth, by, those, that, are, just, and, of, the, family, of, virtue, the, opposite, whereof, is, a, fury, to, man, and, makes, even, life, unsweet, therefore, what, is, more, heavy, than, evil, fame, deserved, or, likewise, who, can, see, worse, days, than, he, that, yet, living, doth, follow, at, the, funerals, of, his, own, reputation, have, laid, up, many, hopes, that, am, privileged, from, that, kind, of, mourning, and, could, wish, the, like, peace, to, all, those, with, whom, wage, love, might, say, much, of, the, commodities, that, death, can, sell, a, man, but, briefly, death, is, a, friend, of, ours, and, he, that, is, not, ready, to, entertain, him, is, not, at, home, whilst, am, my, ambition, is, not, to, foreflow, the, tide, have, but, so, to, make, my, interest, of, it, as, may, account, for, it, would, wish, nothing, but, what, might, better, my, days, nor, desire, any, greater, place, than, the, front, of, good, opinion, make, not, love, to, the, continuance, of, days, but, to, the, goodness, of, them, nor, wish, to, die, but, refer, myself, to, my, hour, which, the, great, dispenser, of, all, things, hath, appointed, me, yet, as, am, frail, and, suffered, for, the, first, fault, were, it, given, me, to, choose, should, not, be, earnest, to, see, the, evening, of, my, age, that, extremity, of, itself, being, a, disease, and, a, mere, return, into, infancy, so, that, if, perpetuity, of, life, might, be, given, me, should, think, what, the, greek, poet, said, “such, an, age, is, a, mortal, evil, ”, and, since, must, needs, be, dead, require, it, may, not, be, done, before, mine, enemies, that, be, not, stript, before, be, cold, but, before, my, friends, the, night, is, even, now, but, that, name, is, lost, it, is, not, now, late, but, early, mine, eyes, begin, to, discharge, their, watch, and, compound, with, this, fleshly, weakness, for, a, time, of, perpetual, rest, and, shall, presently, be, as, happy, for, a, few, hours, as, had, died, the, first, hour, was, born, the, earliest, antiquity, lies, buried, in, silence, and, oblivion, excepting, the, remains, we, have, of, it, in, sacred, writ, this, silence, was, succeeded, by, poetical, fables, and, these, at, length, by, the, writings, we, now, enjoy, so, that, the, concealed, and, secret, learning, of, the, ancients, seems, separated, from, the, history, and, knowledge, of, the, following, ages, by, a, veil, or, partition-wall, of, fables, interposing, between, the, things, that, are, lost, and, those, that, remain, [615], many, may, imagine, that, am, here, entering, upon, a, work, of, fancy, or, amusement, and, design, to, use, a, poetical, liberty, in, explaining, poetical, fables, it, is, true, fables, in, general, are, composed, of, ductile, matter, that, may, be, drawn, into, great, variety, by, a, witty, talent, or, an, inventive, genius, and, be, delivered, of, plausible, meanings, which, they, never, contained, but, this, procedure, has, already, been, carried, to, excess, and, great, numbers, to, procure, the, sanction, of, antiquity, to, their, own, notions, and, inventions, have, miserably, wrested, and, abused, the, fables, of, the, ancients, nor, is, this, only, a, late, or, unfrequent, practice, but, of, ancient, date, and, common, even, to, this, day, thus, chrysippus, like, an, interpreter, of, dreams, attributed, the, opinions, of, the, stoics, to, the, poets, of, old, and, the, chemists, at, present, more, childishly, apply, the, poetical, transformations, to, their, experiments, of, the, furnace, and, though, have, well, weighed, and, considered, all, this, and, thoroughly, seen, into, the, levity, which, the, mind, indulges, for, allegories, and, allusions, yet, cannot, but, retain, a, high, value, for, the, ancient, mythology, and, certainly, it, were, very, injudicious, to, suffer, the, fondness, and, licentiousness, of, a, few, to, detract, from, the, honor, of, all, ego, and, parable, in, general, this, would, be, rash, and, almost, profane, for, since, religion, delights, in, such, shadows, and, disguises, to, abolish, them, were, in, a, manner, to, prohibit, all, intercourse, betwixt, things, divine, and, human, upon, deliberate, consideration, my, judgment, is, that, a, concealed, instruction, and, allegory, was, originally, intended, in, many, of, the, ancient, fables, this, opinion, may, in, some, respect, be, owing, to, the, veneration, have, for, antiquity, but, more, to, observing, that, some, fables, discover, a, great, and, evident, similitude, relation, and, connection, with, the, thing, they, signify, as, well, in, the, structure, of, the, fable, as, in, the, propriety, of, the, names, whereby, the, persons, or, actors, are, characterized, insomuch, that, no, one, could, positively, deny, a, sense, and, meaning, to, be, from, the, first, intended, and, purposely, shadowed, out, in, them, for, who, can, hear, that, fame, after, the, giants, were, destroyed, sprung, up, as, their, posthumous, sister, and, not, apply, it, to, the, clamor, of, parties, and, the, seditious, rumors, which, commonly, fly, about, for, a, time, upon, the, quelling, of, insurrections, or, who, can, read, how, the, giant, typhon, cut, out, and, carried, away, jupiter’s, sinews—which, mercury, afterwards, stole, and, again, restored, to, jupiter—and, not, presently, observe, that, this, allegory, denotes, strong, and, powerful, rebellions, which, cut, away, from, kings, their, sinews, both, of, money, and, authority, and, that, the, way, to, have, them, restored, is, by, lenity, affability, and, prudent, edicts, which, soon, reconcile, and, as, it, were, steal, upon, the, affections, of, the, subject, or, who, upon, hearing, that, memorable, expedition, of, the, gods, against, the, giants, when, the, braying, of, silenus’s, ass, greatly, contributed, in, putting, the, giants, to, flight, does, not, clearly, conceive, that, this, directly, points, at, the, monstrous, enterprises, of, rebellious, subjects, which, are, frequently, frustrated, and, disappointed, by, vain, fears, and, empty, rumors, again, the, conformity, and, purport, of, the, names, is, frequently, manifest, and, self-evident, thus, metis, the, wife, of, jupiter, plainly, signifies, counsel, typhon, swelling, pan, universality, nemesis, revenge, &c, nor, is, it, a, wonder, if, sometimes, a, piece, of, history, or, other, things, are, introduced, by, way, of, ornament, or, if, the, times, of, the, action, are, confounded, or, if, part, of, one, fable, be, tacked, to, another, or, if, the, allegory, be, new, turned, for, all, this, must, necessarily, happen, as, the, fables, were, the, inventions, of, men, who, lived, in, different, ages, and, had, different, views, some, of, them, being, ancient, others, more, modern, some, having, an, eye, to, natural, philosophy, and, others, to, morality, or, civil, policy, it, may, pass, for, a, further, indication, of, a, concealed, and, secret, meaning, that, some, of, these, fables, are, so, absurd, and, idle, in, their, narration, as, to, show, and, proclaim, an, allegory, even, afar, off, fable, that, carries, probability, with, it, may, be, supposed, invented, for, pleasure, or, in, imitation, of, history, but, those, that, could, never, be, conceived, or, related, in, this, way, must, surely, have, a, different, use, for, example, what, a, monstrous, fiction, is, this, that, jupiter, should, take, metis, to, wife, and, as, soon, as, he, found, her, pregnant, eat, her, up, whereby, he, also, conceived, and, out, of, his, head, brought, forth, pallas, armed, certainly, no, mortal, could, but, for, the, sake, of, the, moral, it, couches, invent, such, an, absurd, dream, as, this, so, much, out, of, the, road, of, thought, but, the, argument, of, most, weight, with, me, is, this, that, many, of, these, fables, by, no, means, appear, to, have, been, invented, by, the, persons, who, relate, and, divulge, them, whether, homer, hesiod, or, others, for, if, were, assured, they, first, flowed, from, those, later, times, and, authors, that, transmit, them, to, us, should, never, expect, any, thing, singularly, great, or, noble, from, such, an, origin, but, whoever, attentively, considers, the, thing, will, find, that, these, fables, are, delivered, down, and, related, by, those, writers, not, as, matters, then, first, invented, and, proposed, but, as, things, received, and, embraced, in, earlier, ages, besides, as, they, are, differently, related, by, writers, nearly, of, the, same, ages, it, is, easily, perceived, that, the, relators, drew, from, the, common, stock, of, ancient, tradition, and, varied, but, in, point, of, embellishment, which, is, their, own, and, this, principally, raises, my, esteem, of, these, fables, which, receive, not, as, the, product, of, the, age, or, invention, of, the, poets, but, as, sacred, relics, gentle, whispers, and, the, breath, of, better, times, that, from, the, traditions, of, more, ancient, nations, came, at, length, into, the, flutes, and, trumpets, of, the, greeks, but, if, any, one, shall, notwithstanding, this, contend, that, allegories, are, always, adventitious, or, imposed, upon, the, ancient, fables, and, no, way, native, or, genuinely, contained, in, them, we, might, here, leave, him, undisturbed, in, that, gravity, of, judgment, he, affects, (though, we, cannot, help, accounting, it, somewhat, dull, and, phlegmatic), and, if, it, were, worth, the, trouble, proceed, to, another, kind, of, argument, men, have, proposed, to, answer, two, different, and, contrary, ends, by, the, use, of, parable, for, parables, serve, as, well, to, instruct, or, illustrate, as, to, wrap, up, and, envelop, so, that, though, for, the, present, we, drop, the, concealed, use, and, suppose, the, ancient, fables, to, be, vague, undeterminate, things, formed, for, amusement, still, the, other, use, must, remain, and, can, never, be, given, up, and, every, man, of, any, learning, must, readily, allow, that, this, method, of, instructing, is, grave, sober, or, exceedingly, useful, and, sometimes, necessary, in, the, sciences, as, it, opens, an, easy, and, familiar, passage, to, the, human, understanding, in, all, new, discoveries, that, are, abstruse, and, out, of, the, road, of, vulgar, opinions, hence, in, the, first, ages, when, such, inventions, and, conclusions, of, the, human, reason, as, are, now, trite, and, common, were, new, and, little, known, all, things, abounded, with, fables, parables, similes, comparisons, and, allusions, which, were, not, intended, to, conceal, but, to, inform, and, teach, whilst, the, minds, of, men, continued, rude, and, unpractised, in, matters, of, subtilty, and, speculation, or, even, impatient, and, in, a, manner, incapable, of, receiving, such, things, as, did, not, fall, directly, under, and, strike, the, senses, for, as, hieroglyphics, were, in, use, before, writing, so, were, parables, in, use, before, arguments, and, even, to, this, day, if, any, man, would, let, new, light, in, upon, the, human, understanding, and, conquer, prejudice, without, raising, contests, animosities, opposition, or, disturbance, he, must, still, go, in, the, same, path, and, have, recourse, to, the, like, method, of, allegory, metaphor, and, allusion, to, conclude, the, knowledge, of, the, early, ages, was, either, great, or, happy, great, if, they, by, design, made, this, use, of, trope, and, figure, happy, if, whilst, they, had, other, views, they, afforded, matter, and, occasion, to, such, noble, contemplations, let, either, be, the, case, our, pains, perhaps, will, not, be, misemployed, whether, we, illustrate, antiquity, or, things, themselves, the, like, indeed, has, been, attempted, by, others, but, to, speak, ingenuously, their, great, and, voluminous, labors, have, almost, destroyed, the, energy, the, efficacy, and, grace, of, the, thing, whilst, being, unskilled, in, nature, and, their, learning, no, more, than, that, of, commonplace, they, have, applied, the, sense, of, the, parables, to, certain, general, and, vulgar, matters, without, reaching, to, their, real, purport, genuine, interpretation, and, full, depth, for, myself, therefore, expect, to, appear, new, in, these, common, things, because, leaving, untouched, such, as, are, sufficiently, plain, and, open, shall, drive, only, at, those, that, are, either, deep, or, rich, [616], the, poets, relate, that, apollo, falling, in, love, with, cassandra, was, still, deluded, and, put, off, by, her, yet, fed, with, hopes, till, she, had, got, from, him, the, gift, of, prophesy, and, having, now, obtained, her, end, she, flatly, rejected, his, suit, apollo, unable, to, recall, his, rash, gift, yet, enraged, to, be, outwitted, by, a, girl, annexed, this, penalty, to, it, that, though, she, should, always, prophesy, true, she, should, never, be, believed, whence, her, divinations, were, always, slighted, even, when, she, again, and, again, predicted, the, ruin, of, her, country, —this, fable, seems, invented, to, express, the, insignificance, of, unseasonable, advice, for, they, who, are, conceited, stubborn, or, intractable, and, listen, not, to, the, instructions, of, apollo, the, god, of, harmony, so, as, to, learn, and, observe, the, modulations, and, measures, of, affairs, the, sharps, and, flats, of, discourse, the, difference, between, judicious, and, vulgar, ears, and, the, proper, times, of, speech, and, silence, let, them, be, ever, so, intelligent, and, ever, so, frank, of, their, advice, or, their, counsels, ever, so, good, and, just, yet, all, their, endeavors, either, of, persuasion, or, force, are, of, little, significance, and, rather, hasten, the, ruin, of, those, they, advise, but, at, last, when, the, calamitous, event, has, made, the, sufferers, feel, the, effect, of, their, neglect, they, too, late, reverence, their, advisers, as, deep, foreseeing, and, faithful, prophets, of, this, we, have, a, remarkable, instance, in, cato, of, utica, who, discovered, afar, off, and, long, foretold, the, approaching, ruin, of, his, country, both, in, the, first, conspiracy, and, as, it, was, prosecuted, in, the, civil, war, between, cæsar, and, pompey, yet, did, no, good, the, while, but, rather, hurt, the, commonwealth, and, hurried, on, its, destruction, which, cicero, wisely, observed, in, these, words, “cato, indeed, judges, excellently, but, prejudices, the, state, for, he, speaks, as, in, the, commonwealth, of, plato, and, not, as, in, the, dregs, of, romulus, ”, the, fable, runs, that, juno, enraged, at, jupiter’s, bringing, forth, pallas, without, her, assistance, incessantly, solicited, all, the, gods, and, goddesses, that, she, might, produce, without, jupiter, and, having, by, violence, and, importunity, obtained, the, grant, she, struck, the, earth, and, thence, immediately, sprung, up, typhon, a, huge, and, dreadful, monster, whom, she, committed, to, the, nursing, of, a, serpent, as, soon, as, he, was, grown, up, this, monster, waged, war, on, jupiter, and, taking, him, prisoner, in, the, battle, carried, him, away, on, his, shoulders, into, a, remote, and, obscure, quarter, and, there, cutting, out, the, sinews, of, his, hands, and, feet, he, bore, them, off, leaving, jupiter, behind, miserably, maimed, and, mangled, but, mercury, afterwards, stole, these, sinews, from, typhon, and, restored, them, to, jupiter, hence, recovering, his, strength, jupiter, again, pursues, the, monster, first, wounds, him, with, a, stroke, of, his, thunder, when, serpents, arose, from, the, blood, of, the, wound, and, now, the, monster, being, dismayed, and, taking, to, flight, jupiter, next, darted, mount, ætna, upon, him, and, crushed, him, with, the, weight, —this, fable, seems, designed, to, express, the, various, fates, of, kings, and, the, turns, that, rebellions, sometimes, take, in, kingdoms, for, princes, may, be, justly, esteemed, married, to, their, states, as, jupiter, to, juno, but, it, sometimes, happens, that, being, depraved, by, long, wielding, of, the, sceptre, and, growing, tyrannical, they, would, engross, all, to, themselves, and, slighting, the, counsel, of, their, senators, and, nobles, conceive, by, themselves, that, is, govern, according, to, their, own, arbitrary, will, and, pleasure, this, inflames, the, people, and, makes, them, endeavor, to, create, and, set, up, some, head, of, their, own, such, designs, are, generally, set, on, foot, by, the, secret, motion, and, instigation, of, the, peers, and, nobles, under, whose, connivance, the, common, sort, are, prepared, for, rising, whence, proceeds, a, swell, in, the, state, which, is, appositely, denoted, by, the, nursing, of, typhon, this, growing, posture, of, affairs, is, fed, by, the, natural, depravity, and, malignant, dispositions, of, the, vulgar, which, to, kings, is, an, envenomed, serpent, and, now, the, disaffected, uniting, their, force, at, length, break, out, into, open, rebellion, which, producing, infinite, mischiefs, both, to, prince, and, people, is, represented, by, the, horrid, and, multiplied, deformity, of, typhon, with, his, hundred, heads, denoting, the, divided, powers, his, flaming, mouths, denoting, fire, and, devastation, his, girdles, of, snakes, denoting, sieges, and, destruction, his, iron, hands, slaughter, and, cruelty, his, eagle’s, talons, rapine, and, plunder, his, plumed, body, perpetual, rumors, contradictory, accounts, &c, and, sometimes, these, rebellions, grow, so, high, that, kings, are, obliged, as, if, carried, on, the, backs, of, the, rebels, to, quit, the, throne, and, retire, to, some, remote, and, obscure, part, of, their, dominions, with, the, loss, of, their, sinews, both, of, money, and, majesty, but, if, now, they, prudently, bear, this, reverse, of, fortune, they, may, in, a, short, time, by, the, assistance, of, mercury, recover, their, sinews, again, that, is, by, becoming, moderate, and, affable, reconciling, the, minds, and, affections, of, the, people, to, them, by, gracious, speeches, and, prudent, proclamations, which, will, win, over, the, subject, cheerfully, to, afford, new, aids, and, supplies, and, add, fresh, vigor, to, authority, but, prudent, and, wary, princes, here, seldom, incline, to, try, fortune, by, a, war, yet, do, their, utmost, by, some, grand, exploit, to, crush, the, reputation, of, the, rebels, and, if, the, attempt, succeeds, the, rebels, conscious, of, the, wound, received, and, distrustful, of, their, cause, first, betake, themselves, to, broken, and, empty, threats, like, the, hissings, of, serpents, and, next, when, matters, are, grown, desperate, to, flight, and, now, when, they, thus, begin, to, shrink, it, is, safe, and, seasonable, for, kings, to, pursue, them, with, their, forces, and, the, whole, strength, of, the, kingdom, thus, effectually, quashing, and, suppressing, them, as, it, were, by, the, weight, of, a, mountain, it, is, related, that, the, cyclops, for, their, savageness, and, cruelty, were, by, jupiter, first, thrown, into, tartarus, and, there, condemned, to, perpetual, imprisonment, but, that, afterwards, tellus, persuaded, jupiter, it, would, be, for, his, service, to, release, them, and, employ, them, in, forging, thunderbolts, this, he, accordingly, did, and, they, with, unwearied, pains, and, diligence, hammered, out, his, bolts, and, other, instruments, of, terror, with, a, frightful, and, continual, din, of, the, anvil, it, happened, long, after, that, jupiter, was, displeased, with, æsculapius, the, son, of, apollo, for, having, by, the, art, of, medicine, restored, a, dead, man, to, life, but, concealing, his, indignation, because, the, action, in, itself, was, pious, and, illustrious, he, secretly, incensed, the, cyclops, against, him, who, without, remorse, presently, slew, him, with, their, thunderbolts, in, revenge, whereof, apollo, with, jupiter’s, connivance, shot, them, all, dead, with, his, arrows, —this, fable, seems, to, point, at, the, behavior, of, princes, who, having, cruel, bloody, and, oppressive, ministers, first, punish, and, displace, them, but, afterwards, by, the, advice, of, tellus, that, is, some, earthly-minded, and, ignoble, person, employ, them, again, to, serve, a, turn, when, there, is, occasion, for, cruelty, in, execution, or, severity, in, exaction, but, these, ministers, being, base, in, their, nature, whet, by, their, former, disgrace, and, well, aware, of, what, is, expected, from, them, use, double, diligence, in, their, office, till, proceeding, unwarily, and, over-eager, to, gain, favor, they, sometimes, from, the, private, nods, and, ambiguous, orders, of, their, prince, perform, some, odious, or, execrable, action, when, princes, to, decline, the, envy, themselves, and, knowing, they, shall, never, want, such, tools, at, their, back, drop, them, and, give, them, up, to, the, friends, and, followers, of, the, injured, person, thus, exposing, them, as, sacrifices, to, revenge, and, popular, odium, whence, with, great, applause, acclamations, and, good, wishes, to, the, prince, these, miscreants, at, last, meet, with, their, desert, narcissus, is, said, to, have, been, extremely, beautiful, and, comely, but, intolerably, proud, and, disdainful, so, that, pleased, with, himself, and, scorning, the, world, he, led, a, solitary, life, in, the, woods, hunting, only, with, a, few, followers, who, were, his, professed, admirers, amongst, whom, the, nymph, echo, was, his, constant, attendant, in, this, method, of, life, it, was, once, his, fate, to, approach, a, clear, fountain, where, he, laid, himself, down, to, rest, in, the, noonday, heat, when, beholding, his, image, in, the, water, he, fell, into, such, a, rapture, and, admiration, of, himself, that, he, could, by, no, means, be, got, away, but, remained, continually, fixed, and, gazing, till, at, length, he, was, turned, into, a, flower, of, his, own, name, which, appears, early, in, the, spring, and, is, consecrated, to, the, infernal, deities, pluto, proserpine, and, the, furies, —this, fable, seems, to, paint, the, behavior, and, fortune, of, those, who, for, their, beauty, or, other, endowments, wherewith, nature, (without, any, industry, of, their, own), has, graced, and, adorned, them, are, extravagantly, fond, of, themselves, for, men, of, such, a, disposition, generally, affect, retirement, and, absence, from, public, affairs, as, a, life, of, business, must, necessarily, subject, them, to, many, neglects, and, contempts, which, might, disturb, and, ruffle, their, minds, whence, such, persons, commonly, lead, a, solitary, private, and, shadowy, life, see, little, company, and, those, only, such, as, highly, admire, and, reverence, them, or, like, an, echo, assent, to, all, they, say, and, they, who, are, depraved, and, rendered, still, fonder, of, themselves, by, this, custom, grow, strangely, indolent, inactive, and, perfectly, stupid, the, narcissus, a, spring, flower, is, an, elegant, emblem, of, this, temper, which, at, first, flourishes, and, is, talked, of, but, when, ripe, frustrates, the, expectation, conceived, of, it, and, that, this, flower, should, be, sacred, to, the, infernal, powers, carries, out, the, allusion, still, further, because, men, of, this, humor, are, perfectly, useless, in, all, respects, for, whatever, yields, no, fruit, but, passes, and, is, no, more, like, the, way, of, a, ship, in, the, sea, was, by, the, ancients, consecrated, to, the, infernal, shades, and, powers, the, only, solemn, oath, by, which, the, gods, irrevocably, obliged, themselves, is, a, well, known, thing, and, makes, a, part, of, many, ancient, fables, to, this, oath, they, did, not, invoke, any, celestial, divinity, or, divine, attribute, but, only, called, to, witness, the, river, styx, which, with, many, meanders, surrounds, the, infernal, court, of, dis, for, this, form, alone, and, none, but, this, was, held, inviolable, and, obligatory, and, the, punishment, of, falsifying, it, was, that, dreaded, one, of, being, excluded, for, a, certain, number, of, years, the, table, of, the, gods, —this, fable, seems, invented, to, show, the, nature, of, the, compacts, and, confederacies, of, princes, which, though, ever, so, solemnly, and, religiously, sworn, to, prove, but, little, the, more, binding, for, it, so, that, oaths, in, this, case, seem, used, rather, for, decorum, reputation, and, ceremony, than, for, fidelity, security, and, effectuating, and, though, these, oaths, were, strengthened, with, the, bonds, of, affinity, which, are, the, links, and, ties, of, nature, and, again, by, mutual, services, and, good, offices, yet, we, see, all, this, will, generally, give, way, to, ambition, convenience, and, the, thirst, of, power, the, rather, because, it, is, easy, for, princes, under, various, specious, pretences, to, defend, disguise, and, conceal, their, ambitious, desires, and, insincerity, having, no, judge, to, call, them, to, account, there, is, however, one, true, and, proper, confirmation, of, their, faith, though, no, celestial, divinity, but, that, great, divinity, of, princes, necessity, or, the, danger, of, the, state, and, the, securing, of, advantage, this, necessity, is, elegantly, represented, by, styx, the, fatal, river, that, can, never, be, crossed, back, and, this, deity, it, was, which, iphicrates, the, athenian, invoked, in, making, a, league, and, because, he, roundly, and, openly, avows, what, most, others, studiously, conceal, it, may, be, proper, to, give, his, own, words, observing, that, the, lacedæmonians, were, inventing, and, proposing, a, variety, of, securities, sanctions, and, bonds, of, alliance, he, interrupted, them, thus, “there, may, indeed, my, friends, be, one, bond, and, means, of, security, between, us, and, that, is, for, you, to, demonstrate, you, have, delivered, into, our, hands, such, things, as, that, if, you, had, the, greatest, desire, to, hurt, us, you, could, not, be, able, ”, therefore, if, the, power, of, offending, be, taken, away, or, if, by, a, breach, of, compact, there, be, danger, of, destruction, or, diminution, to, the, state, or, tribute, then, it, is, that, covenants, will, be, ratified, and, confirmed, as, it, were, by, the, stygian, oath, whilst, there, remains, an, impending, danger, of, being, prohibited, and, excluded, the, banquet, of, the, gods, by, which, expression, the, ancients, denoted, the, rights, and, prerogatives, the, affluence, and, the, felicities, of, empire, and, dominion, [617], the, ancients, have, with, great, exactness, delineated, universal, nature, under, the, person, of, pan, they, leave, his, origin, doubtful, some, asserting, him, the, son, of, mercury, and, others, the, common, offspring, of, all, penelope’s, suitors, the, latter, supposition, doubtless, occasioned, some, later, rivals, to, entitle, this, ancient, fable, penelope, a, thing, frequently, practised, when, the, earlier, relations, are, applied, to, more, modern, characters, and, persons, though, sometimes, with, great, absurdity, and, ignorance, as, in, the, present, case, for, pan, was, one, of, the, ancientest, gods, and, long, before, the, time, of, ulysses, besides, penelope, was, venerated, by, antiquity, for, her, matronal, chastity, third, sort, will, have, him, the, issue, of, jupiter, and, hybris, that, is, reproach, but, whatever, his, origin, was, the, destinies, are, allowed, his, sisters, he, is, described, by, antiquity, with, pyramidal, horns, reaching, up, to, heaven, a, rough, and, shaggy, body, a, very, long, beard, of, a, biform, figure, human, above, half, brute, below, ending, in, goat’s, feet, his, arms, or, ensigns, of, power, are, a, pipe, in, his, left, hand, composed, of, seven, reeds, in, his, right, a, crook, and, he, wore, for, his, mantle, a, leopard’s, skin, his, attributes, and, titles, were, the, god, of, hunters, shepherds, and, all, the, rural, inhabitants, president, of, the, mountains, and, after, mercury, the, next, messenger, of, the, gods, he, was, also, held, the, leader, and, ruler, of, the, nymphs, who, continually, danced, and, frisked, about, him, attended, with, the, satyrs, and, their, elders, the, sileni, he, had, also, the, power, of, striking, terrors, especially, such, as, were, vain, and, superstitious, whence, they, came, to, be, called, panic, terrors, [618], few, actions, are, recorded, of, him, only, a, principal, one, is, that, he, challenged, cupid, at, wrestling, and, was, worsted, he, also, catched, the, giant, typhon, in, a, net, and, held, him, fast, they, relate, further, of, him, that, when, ceres, growing, disconsolate, for, the, rape, of, proserpine, hid, herself, and, all, the, gods, took, the, utmost, pains, to, find, her, by, going, out, different, ways, for, that, purpose, pan, only, had, the, good, fortune, to, meet, her, as, he, was, hunting, and, discovered, her, to, the, rest, he, likewise, had, the, assurance, to, rival, apollo, in, music, and, in, the, judgment, of, midas, was, preferred, but, the, judge, had, though, with, great, privacy, and, secrecy, a, pair, of, ass’s, ears, fastened, on, him, for, his, sentence, [619], there, is, very, little, said, of, his, amours, which, may, seem, strange, among, such, a, multitude, of, gods, so, profusely, amorous, he, is, only, reported, to, have, been, very, fond, of, echo, who, was, also, esteemed, his, wife, and, one, nymph, more, called, syrinx, with, the, love, of, whom, cupid, inflamed, him, for, his, insolent, challenge, so, he, is, reported, once, to, have, solicited, the, moon, to, accompany, him, apart, into, the, deep, woods, lastly, pan, had, no, descendant, which, also, is, a, wonder, when, the, male, gods, were, so, extremely, prolific, only, he, was, the, reputed, father, of, a, servant-girl, called, iambe, who, used, to, divert, strangers, with, her, ridiculous, prattling, stories, this, fable, is, perhaps, the, noblest, of, all, antiquity, and, pregnant, with, the, mysteries, and, secrets, of, nature, pan, as, the, name, imports, represents, the, universe, about, whose, origin, there, are, two, opinions, viz, that, it, either, sprung, from, mercury, that, is, the, divine, word, according, to, the, scriptures, and, philosophical, divines, or, from, the, confused, seeds, of, things, for, they, who, allow, only, one, beginning, of, all, things, either, ascribe, it, to, god, or, if, they, suppose, a, material, beginning, acknowledge, it, to, be, various, in, its, powers, so, that, the, whole, dispute, comes, to, these, points, viz, either, that, nature, proceeds, from, mercury, or, from, penelope, and, all, her, suitors, [620], the, third, origin, of, pan, seems, borrowed, by, the, greeks, from, the, hebrew, mysteries, either, by, means, of, the, egyptians, or, otherwise, for, it, relates, to, the, state, of, the, world, not, in, its, first, creation, but, as, made, subject, to, death, and, corruption, after, the, fall, and, in, this, state, it, was, and, remains, the, offspring, of, god, and, sin, or, jupiter, and, reproach, and, therefore, these, three, several, accounts, of, pan’s, birth, may, seem, true, if, duly, distinguished, in, respect, of, things, and, times, for, this, pan, or, the, universal, nature, of, things, which, we, view, and, contemplate, had, its, origin, from, the, divine, word, and, confused, matter, first, created, by, god, himself, with, the, subsequent, introduction, of, sin, and, consequently, corruption, the, destinies, or, the, natures, and, fates, of, things, are, justly, made, pan’s, sisters, as, the, chain, of, natural, causes, links, together, the, rise, duration, and, corruption, the, exaltation, degeneration, and, workings, the, processes, the, effects, and, changes, of, all, that, can, any, way, happen, to, things, horns, are, given, him, broad, at, the, roots, but, narrow, and, sharp, at, the, top, because, the, nature, of, all, things, seems, pyramidal, for, individuals, are, infinite, but, being, collected, into, a, variety, of, species, they, rise, up, into, kinds, and, these, again, ascend, and, are, contracted, into, generals, till, at, length, nature, may, seem, collected, to, a, point, and, no, wonder, if, pan’s, horns, reach, to, the, heavens, since, the, sublimities, of, nature, or, abstract, ideas, reach, in, a, manner, to, things, divine, for, there, is, a, short, and, ready, passage, from, metaphysics, to, natural, theology, pan’s, body, or, the, body, of, nature, is, with, great, propriety, and, elegance, painted, shaggy, and, hairy, as, representing, the, rays, of, things, for, rays, are, as, the, hair, or, fleece, of, nature, and, more, or, less, worn, by, all, bodies, this, evidently, appears, in, vision, and, in, all, effects, and, operations, at, a, distance, for, whatever, operates, thus, may, be, properly, said, to, emit, rays, [621], but, particularly, the, beard, of, pan, is, exceeding, long, because, the, rays, of, the, celestial, bodies, penetrate, and, act, to, a, prodigious, distance, and, have, descended, into, the, interior, of, the, earth, so, far, as, to, change, its, surface, and, the, sun, himself, when, clouded, on, its, upper, part, appears, to, the, eye, bearded, again, the, body, of, nature, is, justly, described, biform, because, of, the, difference, between, its, superior, and, inferior, parts, as, the, former, for, their, beauty, regularity, of, motion, and, influence, over, the, earth, may, be, properly, represented, by, the, human, figure, and, the, latter, because, of, their, disorder, irregularity, and, subjection, to, the, celestial, bodies, are, by, the, brutal, this, biform, figure, also, represents, the, participation, of, one, species, with, another, for, there, appear, to, be, no, simple, natures, but, all, participate, or, consist, of, two, thus, man, has, somewhat, of, the, brute, the, brute, somewhat, of, the, plant, the, plant, somewhat, of, the, mineral, so, that, all, natural, bodies, have, really, two, faces, or, consist, of, a, superior, and, an, inferior, species, there, lies, a, curious, allegory, in, the, making, of, pan, goat-footed, on, account, of, the, motion, of, ascent, which, the, terrestrial, bodies, have, towards, the, air, and, heavens, for, the, goat, is, a, clambering, creature, that, delights, in, climbing, up, rocks, and, precipices, and, in, the, same, manner, the, matters, destined, to, this, lower, globe, strongly, affect, to, rise, upwards, as, appears, from, the, clouds, and, meteors, pan’s, arms, or, the, ensigns, he, bears, in, his, hands, are, of, two, kinds—the, one, an, emblem, of, harmony, the, other, of, empire, his, pipe, composed, of, seven, reeds, plainly, denotes, the, consent, and, harmony, or, the, concords, and, discords, of, things, produced, by, the, motion, of, the, seven, planets, his, crook, also, contains, a, fine, representation, of, the, ways, of, nature, which, are, partly, straight, and, partly, crooked, thus, the, staff, having, an, extraordinary, bend, towards, the, top, denotes, that, the, works, of, divine, providence, are, generally, brought, about, by, remote, means, or, in, a, circuit, as, if, somewhat, else, were, intended, rather, than, the, effect, produced, as, in, the, sending, of, joseph, into, egypt, &c, so, likewise, in, human, government, they, who, sit, at, the, helm, manage, and, wind, the, people, more, successfully, by, pretext, and, oblique, courses, than, they, could, by, such, as, are, direct, and, straight, so, that, in, effect, all, sceptres, are, crooked, at, the, top, pan’s, mantle, or, clothing, is, with, great, ingenuity, made, of, a, leopard’s, skin, because, of, the, spots, it, has, for, in, like, manner, the, heavens, are, sprinkled, with, stars, the, sea, with, islands, the, earth, with, flowers, and, almost, each, particular, thing, is, variegated, or, wears, a, mottled, coat, the, office, of, pan, could, not, be, more, livelily, expressed, than, by, making, him, the, god, of, hunters, for, every, natural, action, every, motion, and, process, is, no, other, than, a, chase, thus, arts, and, sciences, hunt, out, their, works, and, human, schemes, and, counsels, their, several, ends, and, all, living, creatures, either, hunt, out, their, aliment, pursue, their, prey, or, seek, their, pleasures, and, this, in, a, skilful, and, sagacious, manner, [622], he, is, also, styled, the, god, of, the, rural, inhabitants, because, men, in, this, situation, live, more, according, to, nature, than, they, do, in, cities, and, courts, where, nature, is, so, corrupted, with, effeminate, arts, that, the, saying, of, the, poet, may, be, verified, —, —pars, minima, est, ipsa, puella, sui, [623], he, is, likewise, particularly, styled, president, of, the, mountains, because, in, mountains, and, lofty, places, the, nature, of, things, lies, more, open, and, exposed, to, the, eye, and, the, understanding, in, his, being, called, the, messenger, of, the, gods, next, after, mercury, lies, a, divine, allegory, as, next, after, the, word, of, god, the, image, of, the, world, is, the, herald, of, the, divine, power, and, wisdom, according, to, the, expression, of, the, psalmist, “the, heavens, declare, the, glory, of, god, and, the, firmament, showeth, his, handiwork, ”[624], pan, is, delighted, with, the, company, of, the, nymphs, that, is, the, souls, of, all, living, creatures, are, the, delight, of, the, world, and, he, is, properly, called, their, governor, because, each, of, them, follows, its, own, nature, as, a, leader, and, all, dance, about, their, own, respective, rings, with, infinite, variety, and, never-ceasing, motion, and, with, these, continually, join, the, satyrs, and, sileni, that, is, youth, and, age, for, all, things, have, a, kind, of, young, cheerful, and, dancing, time, and, again, their, time, of, slowness, tottering, and, creeping, and, whoever, in, a, true, light, considers, the, motions, and, endeavors, of, both, these, ages, like, another, democritus, will, perhaps, find, them, as, odd, and, strange, as, the, gesticulations, and, antic, motions, of, the, satyrs, and, sileni, the, power, he, had, of, striking, terrors, contains, a, very, sensible, doctrine, for, nature, has, implanted, fear, in, all, living, creatures, as, well, to, keep, them, from, risking, their, lives, as, to, guard, against, injuries, and, violence, and, yet, this, nature, or, passion, keeps, not, its, bounds, but, with, just, and, profitable, fears, always, mixes, such, as, are, vain, and, senseless, so, that, all, things, if, we, could, see, their, insides, would, appear, full, of, panic, terrors, thus, mankind, particularly, the, vulgar, labor, under, a, high, degree, of, superstition, which, is, nothing, more, than, a, panic-dread, that, principally, reigns, in, unsettled, and, troublesome, times, the, presumption, of, pan, in, challenging, cupid, to, the, conflict, denotes, that, matter, has, an, appetite, and, tendency, to, a, dissolution, of, the, world, and, falling, back, to, its, first, chaos, again, unless, this, depravity, and, inclination, were, restrained, and, subdued, by, a, more, powerful, concord, and, agreement, of, things, properly, expressed, by, love, or, cupid, it, is, therefore, well, for, mankind, and, the, state, of, all, things, that, pan, was, thrown, and, conquered, in, the, struggle, his, catching, and, detaining, typhon, in, the, net, receives, a, similar, explanation, for, whatever, vast, and, unusual, swells, which, the, word, typhon, signifies, may, sometimes, be, raised, in, nature, as, in, the, sea, the, clouds, the, earth, or, the, like, yet, nature, catches, entangles, and, holds, all, such, outrages, and, insurrections, in, her, inextricable, net, wove, as, it, were, of, adamant, that, part, of, the, fable, which, attributes, the, discovery, of, lost, ceres, to, pan, whilst, he, was, hunting—a, happiness, denied, the, other, gods, though, they, diligently, and, expressly, sought, her—contains, an, exceeding, just, and, prudent, admonition, viz, that, we, are, not, to, expect, the, discovery, of, things, useful, in, common, life, as, that, of, corn, denoted, by, ceres, from, abstract, philosophies, as, if, these, were, the, gods, of, the, first, order, —no, not, though, we, used, our, utmost, endeavors, this, way, —but, only, from, pan, that, is, a, sagacious, experience, and, general, knowledge, of, nature, which, is, often, found, even, by, accident, to, stumble, upon, such, discoveries, whilst, the, pursuit, was, directed, another, way, the, event, of, his, contending, with, apollo, in, music, affords, us, a, useful, instruction, that, may, help, to, humble, the, human, reason, and, judgment, which, is, too, apt, to, boast, and, glory, in, itself, there, seem, to, be, two, kinds, of, harmony, —the, one, of, divine, providence, the, other, of, human, reason, but, the, government, of, the, world, the, administration, of, its, affairs, and, the, more, secret, divine, judgments, sound, harsh, and, dissonant, to, human, ears, or, human, judgment, and, though, this, ignorance, be, justly, rewarded, with, asses’, ears, yet, they, are, put, on, and, worn, not, openly, but, with, great, secrecy, nor, is, the, deformity, of, the, thing, seen, or, observed, by, the, vulgar, we, must, not, find, it, strange, if, no, amours, are, related, of, pan, besides, his, marriage, with, echo, for, nature, enjoys, itself, and, in, itself, all, other, things, he, that, loves, desires, enjoyment, but, in, profusion, there, is, no, room, for, desire, and, therefore, pan, remaining, content, with, himself, has, no, passion, unless, it, be, for, discourse, which, is, well, shadowed, out, by, echo, or, talk, or, when, it, is, more, accurate, by, syrinx, or, writing, [625], but, echo, makes, a, most, excellent, wife, for, pan, as, being, no, other, than, genuine, philosophy, which, faithfully, repeats, his, words, or, only, transcribes, exactly, as, nature, dictates, thus, representing, the, true, image, and, reflection, of, the, world, without, adding, a, tittle, it, tends, also, to, the, support, and, perfection, of, pan, or, nature, to, be, without, offspring, for, the, world, generates, in, its, parts, and, not, in, the, way, of, a, whole, as, wanting, a, body, external, to, itself, wherewith, to, generate, lastly, for, the, supposed, or, spurious, prattling, daughter, of, pan, it, is, an, excellent, addition, to, the, fable, and, aptly, represents, the, talkative, philosophies, that, have, at, all, times, been, stirring, and, filled, the, world, with, idle, tales, being, ever, barren, empty, and, servile, though, sometimes, indeed, diverting, and, entertaining, and, sometimes, again, troublesome, and, importunate, [626], “the, fable, relates, that, perseus, was, dispatched, from, the, east, by, pallas, to, cut, off, medusa’s, head, who, had, committed, great, ravage, upon, the, people, of, the, west, for, this, medusa, was, so, dire, a, monster, as, to, turn, into, stone, all, those, who, but, looked, upon, her, she, was, a, gorgon, and, the, only, mortal, one, of, the, three, the, other, two, being, invulnerable, perseus, therefore, preparing, himself, for, this, grand, enterprise, had, presents, made, him, from, three, of, the, gods, mercury, gave, him, wings, for, his, heels, pluto, a, helmet, and, pallas, a, shield, and, a, mirror, but, though, he, was, now, so, well, equipped, he, posted, not, directly, to, medusa, but, first, turned, aside, to, the, greæ, who, were, half-sisters, to, the, gorgons, these, greæ, were, grayheaded, and, like, old, women, from, their, birth, having, among, them, all, three, but, one, eye, and, one, tooth, which, as, they, had, occasion, to, go, out, they, each, wore, by, turns, and, laid, them, down, again, upon, coming, back, this, eye, and, this, tooth, they, lent, to, perseus, who, now, judging, himself, sufficiently, furnished, he, without, further, stop, flies, swiftly, away, to, medusa, and, finds, her, asleep, but, not, venturing, his, eyes, for, fear, she, should, wake, he, turned, his, head, aside, and, viewed, her, in, pallas’s, mirror, and, thus, directing, his, stroke, cut, off, her, head, when, immediately, from, the, gushing, blood, there, darted, pegasus, winged, perseus, now, inserted, medusa’s, head, into, pallas’s, shield, which, thence, retained, the, faculty, of, astonishing, and, benumbing, all, who, looked, on, it, ”, this, fable, seems, invented, to, show, the, prudent, method, of, choosing, undertaking, and, conducting, a, war, and, accordingly, lays, down, three, useful, precepts, about, it, as, if, they, were, the, precepts, of, pallas, the, first, is, that, no, prince, should, be, over-solicitous, to, subdue, a, neighboring, nation, for, the, method, of, enlarging, an, empire, is, very, different, from, that, of, increasing, an, estate, regard, is, justly, had, to, contiguity, or, adjacency, in, private, lands, and, possessions, but, in, the, extending, of, empire, the, occasion, the, facility, and, advantage, of, a, war, are, to, be, regarded, instead, of, vicinity, it, is, certain, that, the, romans, at, the, time, they, stretched, but, little, beyond, liguria, to, the, west, had, by, their, arms, subdued, the, provinces, as, far, as, mount, taurus, to, the, east, and, thus, perseus, readily, undertook, a, very, long, expedition, even, from, the, east, to, the, extremities, of, the, west, the, second, precept, is, that, the, cause, of, the, war, be, just, and, honorable, for, this, adds, alacrity, both, to, the, soldiers, and, the, people, who, find, the, supplies, procures, aids, alliances, and, numerous, other, conveniences, now, there, is, no, cause, of, war, more, just, and, laudable, than, the, suppressing, of, tyranny, by, which, a, people, are, dispirited, benumbed, or, left, without, life, and, vigor, as, at, the, sight, of, medusa, lastly, it, is, prudently, added, that, as, there, were, three, of, the, gorgons, who, represent, war, perseus, singled, her, out, for, this, expedition, that, was, mortal, which, affords, this, precept, that, such, kind, of, wars, should, be, chose, as, may, be, brought, to, a, conclusion, without, pursuing, vast, and, infinite, hopes, again, perseus’s, setting-out, is, extremely, well, adapted, to, his, undertaking, and, in, a, manner, commands, success, he, received, dispatch, from, mercury, secrecy, from, pluto, and, foresight, from, pallas, it, also, contains, an, excellent, allegory, that, the, wings, given, him, by, mercury, were, for, his, heels, not, for, his, shoulders, because, expedition, is, not, so, much, required, in, the, first, preparations, for, war, as, in, the, subsequent, matters, that, administer, to, the, first, for, there, is, no, error, more, frequent, in, war, than, after, brisk, preparations, to, halt, for, subsidiary, forces, and, effective, supplies, the, allegory, of, pluto’s, helmet, rendering, men, invisible, and, secret, is, sufficiently, evident, of, itself, but, the, mystery, of, the, shield, and, the, mirror, lies, deeper, and, denotes, that, not, only, a, prudent, caution, must, be, had, to, defend, like, the, shield, but, also, such, an, address, and, penetration, as, may, discover, the, strength, the, motions, the, counsels, and, designs, of, the, enemy, like, the, mirror, of, pallas, but, though, perseus, may, now, seem, extremely, well, prepared, there, still, remains, the, most, important, thing, of, all, before, he, enters, upon, the, war, he, must, of, necessity, consult, the, greæ, these, greæ, are, treasons, half, but, degenerate, sisters, of, the, gorgons, who, are, representatives, of, wars, for, wars, are, generous, and, noble, but, treasons, base, and, vile, the, greæ, are, elegantly, described, as, hoary-headed, and, like, old, women, from, their, birth, on, account, of, the, perpetual, cares, fears, and, trepidations, attending, traitors, their, force, also, before, it, breaks, out, into, open, revolt, consists, either, in, an, eye, or, a, tooth, for, all, faction, alienated, from, a, state, is, both, watchful, and, biting, and, this, eye, and, tooth, are, as, it, were, common, to, all, the, disaffected, because, whatever, they, learn, and, know, is, transmitted, from, one, to, another, as, by, the, hands, of, faction, and, for, the, tooth, they, all, bite, with, the, same, and, clamor, with, one, throat, so, that, each, of, them, singly, expresses, the, multitude, these, greæ, therefore, must, be, prevailed, upon, by, perseus, to, lend, him, their, eye, and, their, tooth, the, eye, to, give, him, indications, and, make, discoveries, the, tooth, for, sowing, rumors, raising, envy, and, stirring, up, the, minds, of, the, people, and, when, all, these, things, are, thus, disposed, and, prepared, then, follows, the, action, of, the, war, he, finds, medusa, asleep, for, whoever, undertakes, a, war, with, prudence, generally, falls, upon, the, enemy, unprepared, and, nearly, in, a, state, of, security, and, here, is, the, occasion, for, pallas’s, mirror, for, it, is, common, enough, before, the, danger, presents, itself, to, see, exactly, into, the, state, and, posture, of, the, enemy, but, the, principal, use, of, the, glass, is, in, the, very, instant, of, danger, to, discover, the, manner, thereof, and, prevent, consternation, which, is, the, thing, intended, by, perseus’s, turning, his, head, aside, and, viewing, the, enemy, in, the, glass, [627], two, effects, here, follow, the, conquest, 1, the, darting, forth, of, pegasus, which, evidently, denotes, fame, that, flies, abroad, proclaiming, the, victory, far, and, near, 2, the, bearing, of, medusa’s, head, in, the, shield, which, is, the, greatest, possible, defence, and, safeguard, for, one, grand, and, memorable, enterprise, happily, accomplished, bridles, all, the, motions, and, attempts, of, the, enemy, stupefies, disaffection, and, quells, commotions, the, goddess, luna, is, said, to, have, fallen, in, love, with, the, shepherd, endymion, and, to, have, carried, on, her, amours, with, him, in, a, new, and, singular, manner, it, being, her, custom, whilst, he, lay, reposing, in, his, native, cave, under, mount, latmus, to, descend, frequently, from, her, sphere, enjoy, his, company, whilst, he, slept, and, then, go, up, to, heaven, again, and, all, this, while, endymion’s, fortune, was, no, way, prejudiced, by, his, unactive, and, sleepy, life, the, goddess, causing, his, flocks, to, thrive, and, grow, so, exceeding, numerous, that, none, of, the, other, shepherds, could, compare, with, him, —this, fable, seems, to, describe, the, tempers, and, dispositions, of, princes, who, being, thoughtful, and, suspicious, do, not, easily, admit, to, their, privacies, such, men, as, are, prying, curious, and, vigilant, or, as, it, were, sleepless, but, rather, such, as, are, of, an, easy, obliging, nature, and, indulge, them, in, their, pleasures, without, seeking, anything, further, but, seeming, ignorant, insensible, or, as, it, were, lulled, asleep, before, them, [628], princes, usually, treat, such, persons, familiarly, and, quitting, their, throne, like, luna, think, they, may, with, safety, unbosom, to, them, this, temper, was, very, remarkable, in, tiberius, a, prince, exceedingly, difficult, to, please, and, who, had, no, favorites, but, those, that, perfectly, understood, his, way, and, at, the, same, time, obstinately, dissembled, their, knowledge, almost, to, a, degree, of, stupidity, the, cave, is, not, improperly, mentioned, in, the, fable, it, being, a, common, thing, for, the, favorites, of, a, prince, to, have, their, pleasant, retreats, whither, to, invite, him, by, way, of, relaxation, though, without, prejudice, to, their, own, fortunes, these, favorites, usually, making, a, good, provision, for, themselves, for, though, their, prince, should, not, perhaps, promote, them, to, dignities, yet, out, of, real, affection, and, not, only, for, convenience, they, generally, feel, the, enriching, influence, of, his, bounty, the, poets, relate, that, the, giants, produced, from, the, earth, made, war, upon, jupiter, and, the, other, gods, but, were, repulsed, and, conquered, by, thunder, whereat, the, earth, provoked, brought, forth, fame, the, youngest, sister, of, the, giants, in, revenge, for, the, death, of, her, sons, —the, meaning, of, the, fable, seems, to, be, this, the, earth, denotes, the, nature, of, the, vulgar, who, are, always, swelling, and, rising, against, their, rulers, and, endeavoring, at, changes, this, disposition, getting, a, fit, opportunity, breeds, rebels, and, traitors, who, with, impetuous, rage, threaten, and, contrive, the, overthrow, and, destruction, of, princes, and, when, brought, under, and, subdued, the, same, vile, and, restless, nature, of, the, people, impatient, of, peace, produces, rumors, detractions, slanders, libels, &c, to, blacken, those, in, authority, so, that, rebellious, actions, and, seditious, rumors, differ, not, in, origin, and, stock, but, only, as, it, were, in, sex, treasons, and, rebellions, being, the, brothers, and, scandal, or, detraction, the, sister, the, ancients, afford, us, two, examples, for, suppressing, the, impertinent, curiosity, of, mankind, in, diving, into, secrets, and, imprudently, longing, and, endeavoring, to, discover, them, the, one, of, these, is, in, the, person, of, acteon, and, the, other, in, that, of, pentheus, acteon, undesignedly, chancing, to, see, diana, naked, was, turned, into, a, stag, and, torn, to, pieces, by, his, own, hounds, and, pentheus, desiring, to, pry, into, the, hidden, mysteries, of, bacchus’s, sacrifice, and, climbing, a, tree, for, that, purpose, was, struck, with, a, frenzy, this, frenzy, of, pentheus, caused, him, to, see, things, double, particularly, the, sun, and, his, own, city, thebes, so, that, running, homewards, and, immediately, espying, another, thebes, he, runs, towards, that, and, thus, continues, incessantly, tending, first, to, the, one, and, then, to, the, other, without, coming, at, either, —the, first, of, these, fables, may, relate, to, the, secrets, of, princes, and, the, second, to, divine, mysteries, for, they, who, are, not, intimate, with, a, prince, yet, against, his, will, have, a, knowledge, of, his, secrets, inevitably, incur, his, displeasure, and, therefore, being, aware, that, they, are, singled, out, and, all, opportunities, watched, against, them, they, lead, the, life, of, a, stag, full, of, fears, and, suspicions, it, likewise, frequently, happens, that, their, servants, and, domestics, accuse, them, and, plot, their, overthrow, in, order, to, procure, favor, with, the, prince, for, whenever, the, king, manifests, his, displeasure, the, person, it, falls, upon, must, expect, his, servants, to, betray, him, and, worry, him, down, as, acteon, was, worried, by, his, own, dogs, the, punishment, of, pentheus, is, of, another, kind, for, they, who, unmindful, of, their, mortal, state, rashly, aspire, to, divine, mysteries, by, climbing, the, heights, of, nature, and, philosophy, here, represented, by, climbing, a, tree, —their, fate, is, perpetual, inconstancy, perplexity, and, instability, of, judgment, for, as, there, is, one, light, of, nature, and, another, light, that, is, divine, they, see, as, it, were, two, suns, and, as, the, actions, of, life, and, the, determinations, of, the, will, depend, upon, the, understanding, they, are, distracted, as, much, in, opinion, as, in, will, and, therefore, judge, very, inconsistently, or, contradictorily, and, see, as, it, were, thebes, double, for, thebes, being, the, refuge, and, habitation, of, pentheus, here, denotes, the, ends, of, actions, whence, they, know, not, what, course, to, take, but, remaining, undetermined, and, unresolved, in, their, views, and, designs, they, are, merely, driven, about, by, every, sudden, gust, and, impulse, of, the, mind, —the, fable, of, orpheus, though, trite, and, common, has, never, been, well, interpreted, and, seems, to, hold, out, a, picture, of, universal, philosophy, for, to, this, sense, may, be, easily, transferred, what, is, said, of, his, being, a, wonderful, and, perfectly, divine, person, skilled, in, all, kinds, of, harmony, subduing, and, drawing, all, things, after, him, by, sweet, and, gentle, methods, and, modulations, for, the, labors, of, orpheus, exceed, the, labors, of, hercules, both, in, power, and, dignity, as, the, works, of, knowledge, exceed, the, works, of, strength, —orpheus, having, his, beloved, wife, snatched, from, him, by, sudden, death, resolved, upon, descending, to, the, infernal, regions, to, try, if, by, the, power, of, his, harp, he, could, reobtain, her, and, in, effect, he, so, appeased, and, soothed, the, infernal, powers, by, the, melody, and, sweetness, of, his, harp, and, voice, that, they, indulged, him, the, liberty, of, taking, her, back, on, condition, that, she, should, follow, him, behind, and, he, not, turn, to, look, upon, her, till, they, came, into, open, day, but, he, through, the, impatience, of, his, care, and, affection, and, thinking, himself, almost, past, danger, at, length, looked, behind, him, whereby, the, condition, was, violated, and, she, again, precipitated, to, pluto’s, regions, from, this, time, orpheus, grew, pensive, and, sad, a, hater, of, the, sex, and, went, into, solitude, where, by, the, same, sweetness, of, his, harp, and, voice, he, first, drew, the, wild, beasts, of, all, sorts, about, him, so, that, forgetting, their, natures, they, were, neither, actuated, by, revenge, cruelty, lust, hunger, or, the, desire, of, prey, but, stood, gazing, about, him, in, a, tame, and, gentle, manner, listening, attentively, to, his, music, nay, so, great, was, the, power, and, efficacy, of, his, harmony, that, it, even, caused, the, trees, and, stones, to, remove, and, place, themselves, in, a, regular, manner, about, him, when, he, had, for, a, time, and, with, great, admiration, continued, to, do, this, at, length, the, thracian, women, raised, by, the, instigation, of, bacchus, first, blew, a, deep, and, hoarse-sounding, horn, in, such, an, outrageous, manner, that, it, quite, drowned, the, music, of, orpheus, and, thus, the, power, which, as, the, link, of, their, society, held, all, things, in, order, being, dissolved, disturbance, reigned, anew, each, creature, returned, to, its, own, nature, and, pursued, and, preyed, upon, its, fellow, as, before, the, rocks, and, woods, also, started, back, to, their, former, places, and, even, orpheus, himself, was, at, last, torn, to, pieces, by, these, female, furies, and, his, limbs, scattered, all, over, the, desert, but, in, sorrow, and, revenge, for, his, death, the, river, helicon, sacred, to, the, muses, hid, its, waters, under, ground, and, rose, again, in, other, places, —the, fable, receives, this, explanation, the, music, of, orpheus, is, of, two, kinds, one, that, appeases, the, infernal, powers, and, the, other, that, draws, together, the, wild, beasts, and, trees, the, former, properly, relates, to, natural, and, the, latter, to, moral, philosophy, or, civil, society, the, reinstatement, and, restoration, of, corruptible, things, is, the, noblest, work, of, natural, philosophy, and, in, a, less, degree, the, preservation, of, bodies, in, their, own, state, or, a, prevention, of, their, dissolution, and, corruption, and, if, this, be, possible, it, can, certainly, be, effected, no, other, way, than, by, proper, and, exquisite, attemperations, of, nature, as, it, were, by, the, harmony, and, fine, touching, of, the, harp, but, as, this, is, a, thing, of, exceeding, great, difficulty, the, end, is, seldom, obtained, and, that, probably, for, no, reason, more, than, a, curious, and, unseasonable, impatience, and, solicitude, and, therefore, philosophy, being, almost, unequal, to, the, task, has, cause, to, grow, sad, and, hence, betakes, itself, to, human, affairs, insinuating, into, men’s, minds, the, love, of, virtue, equity, and, peace, by, means, of, eloquence, and, persuasion, thus, forming, men, into, societies, bringing, them, under, laws, and, regulations, and, making, them, forget, their, unbridled, passions, and, affections, so, long, as, they, hearken, to, precepts, and, submit, to, discipline, and, thus, they, soon, after, build, themselves, habitations, form, cities, cultivate, lands, plant, orchards, gardens, &c, so, that, they, may, not, improperly, be, said, to, remove, and, call, the, trees, and, stones, together, and, this, regard, to, civil, affairs, is, justly, and, regularly, placed, after, diligent, trial, made, for, restoring, the, mortal, body, the, attempt, being, frustrated, in, the, end—because, the, unavoidable, necessity, of, death, thus, evidently, laid, before, mankind, animates, them, to, seek, a, kind, of, eternity, by, works, of, perpetuity, character, and, fame, it, is, also, prudently, added, that, orpheus, was, afterwards, averse, to, women, and, wedlock, because, the, indulgence, of, the, married, state, and, the, natural, affections, which, men, have, for, their, children, often, prevent, them, from, entering, upon, any, grand, noble, or, meritorious, enterprise, for, the, public, good, as, thinking, it, sufficient, to, obtain, immortality, by, their, descendants, without, endeavoring, at, great, actions, and, even, the, works, of, knowledge, though, the, most, excellent, among, human, things, have, their, periods, for, after, kingdoms, and, commonwealths, have, flourished, for, a, time, disturbances, seditions, and, wars, often, arise, in, the, din, whereof, first, the, laws, are, silent, and, not, heard, and, then, men, return, to, their, own, depraved, natures—whence, cultivated, lands, and, cities, soon, become, desolate, and, waste, and, if, this, disorder, continues, learning, and, philosophy, is, infallibly, torn, to, pieces, so, that, only, some, scattered, fragments, thereof, can, afterwards, be, found, up, and, down, in, a, few, places, like, planks, after, a, shipwreck, and, barbarous, times, succeeding, the, river, helicon, dips, under-ground, that, is, letters, are, buried, till, things, having, undergone, their, due, course, of, changes, learning, rises, again, and, shows, its, head, though, seldom, in, the, same, place, but, in, some, other, nation, [629], the, poets, relate, that, cœlum, was, the, most, ancient, of, all, the, gods, that, his, parts, of, generation, were, cut, off, by, his, son, saturn, that, saturn, had, a, numerous, offspring, but, devoured, all, his, sons, as, soon, as, they, were, born, that, jupiter, at, length, escaped, the, common, fate, and, when, grown, up, drove, his, father, saturn, into, tartarus, usurped, the, kingdom, cut, off, his, father’s, genitals, with, the, same, knife, wherewith, saturn, had, dismembered, cœlum, and, throwing, them, into, the, sea, thence, sprung, venus, before, jupiter, was, well, established, in, his, empire, two, memorable, wars, were, made, upon, him, the, first, by, the, titans, in, subduing, of, whom, sol, the, only, one, of, the, titans, who, favored, jupiter, performed, him, singular, service, the, second, by, the, giants, who, being, destroyed, and, subdued, by, the, thunder, and, arms, of, jupiter, he, now, reigned, secure, —this, fable, appears, to, be, an, enigmatical, account, of, the, origin, of, all, things, not, greatly, differing, from, the, philosophy, afterwards, embraced, by, democritus, who, expressly, asserts, the, eternity, of, matter, but, denies, the, eternity, of, the, world, thereby, approaching, to, the, truth, of, sacred, writ, which, makes, chaos, or, uninformed, matter, to, exist, before, the, six, days’, works, the, meaning, of, the, fable, seems, to, be, this, cœlum, denotes, the, concave, space, or, vaulted, roof, that, incloses, all, matter, and, saturn, the, matter, itself, which, cuts, off, all, power, of, generation, from, his, father, as, one, and, the, same, quantity, of, matter, remains, invariable, in, nature, without, addition, or, diminution, but, the, agitations, and, struggling, motions, of, matter, first, produced, certain, imperfect, and, ill-joined, compositions, of, things, as, it, were, so, many, first, rudiments, or, essays, of, worlds, till, in, process, of, time, there, arose, a, fabric, capable, of, preserving, its, form, and, structure, whence, the, first, age, was, shadowed, out, by, the, reign, of, saturn, who, on, account, of, the, frequent, dissolutions, and, short, durations, of, things, was, said, to, devour, his, children, and, the, second, age, was, denoted, by, the, reign, of, jupiter, who, thrust, or, drove, those, frequent, and, transitory, changes, into, tartarus—a, place, expressive, of, disorder, this, place, seems, to, be, the, middle, space, between, the, lower, heavens, and, the, internal, parts, of, the, earth, wherein, disorder, imperfection, mutation, mortality, destruction, and, corruption, are, principally, found, venus, was, not, born, during, the, former, generation, of, things, under, the, reign, of, saturn, for, whilst, discord, and, jar, had, the, upper, hand, of, concord, and, uniformity, in, the, matter, of, the, universe, a, change, of, the, entire, structure, was, necessary, and, in, this, manner, things, were, generated, and, destroyed, before, saturn, was, dismembered, but, when, this, manner, of, generation, ceased, there, immediately, followed, another, brought, about, by, venus, or, a, perfect, and, established, harmony, of, things, whereby, changes, were, wrought, in, the, parts, whilst, the, universal, fabric, remained, entire, and, undisturbed, saturn, however, is, said, to, be, thrust, out, and, dethroned, not, killed, and, become, extinct, because, agreeably, to, the, opinion, of, democritus, the, world, might, relapse, into, its, old, confusion, and, disorder, which, lucretius, hoped, would, not, happen, in, his, time, [630], but, now, when, the, world, was, compact, and, held, together, by, its, own, bulk, and, energy, yet, there, was, no, rest, from, the, beginning, for, first, there, followed, considerable, motions, and, disturbances, in, the, celestial, regions, though, so, regulated, and, moderated, by, the, power, of, the, sun, prevailing, over, the, heavenly, bodies, as, to, continue, the, world, in, its, state, afterwards, there, followed, the, like, in, the, lower, parts, by, inundations, storms, winds, general, earthquakes, &c, which, however, being, subdued, and, kept, under, there, ensued, a, more, peaceable, and, lasting, harmony, and, consent, of, things, it, may, be, said, of, this, fable, that, it, includes, philosophy, and, again, that, philosophy, includes, the, fable, for, we, know, by, faith, that, all, these, things, are, but, the, oracle, of, sense, long, since, ceased, and, decayed, but, the, matter, and, fabric, of, the, world, being, justly, attributed, to, a, creator, proteus, according, to, the, poets, was, neptune’s, herdsman, an, old, man, and, a, most, extraordinary, prophet, who, understood, things, past, and, present, as, well, as, future, so, that, besides, the, business, of, divination, he, was, the, revealer, and, interpreter, of, all, antiquity, and, secrets, of, every, kind, he, lived, in, a, vast, cave, where, his, custom, was, to, tell, over, his, herd, of, sea-calves, at, noon, and, then, to, sleep, whoever, consulted, him, had, no, other, way, of, obtaining, an, answer, but, by, binding, him, with, manacles, and, fetters, when, he, endeavoring, to, free, himself, would, change, into, all, kinds, of, shapes, and, miraculous, forms, as, of, fire, water, wild, beasts, &c, till, at, length, he, resumed, his, own, shape, again, —this, fable, seems, to, point, at, the, secrets, of, nature, and, the, states, of, matter, for, the, person, of, proteus, denotes, matter, the, oldest, of, all, things, after, god, himself, [631], that, resides, as, in, a, cave, under, the, vast, concavity, of, the, heavens, he, is, represented, as, the, servant, of, neptune, because, the, various, operations, and, modifications, of, matter, are, principally, wrought, in, a, fluid, state, the, herd, or, flock, of, proteus, seems, to, be, no, other, than, the, several, kinds, of, animals, plants, and, minerals, in, which, matter, appears, to, diffuse, and, spend, itself, so, that, after, having, formed, these, several, species, and, as, it, were, finished, its, task, it, seems, to, sleep, and, repose, without, otherwise, attempting, to, produce, any, new, ones, and, this, is, the, moral, of, proteus’s, counting, his, herd, then, going, to, sleep, this, is, said, to, be, done, at, noon, not, in, the, morning, or, evening, by, which, is, meant, the, time, best, fitted, and, disposed, for, the, production, of, species, from, a, matter, duly, prepared, and, made, ready, beforehand, and, now, lying, in, a, middle, state, between, its, first, rudiments, and, decline, which, we, learn, from, sacred, history, was, the, case, at, the, time, of, the, creation, when, by, the, efficacy, of, the, divine, command, matter, directly, came, together, without, any, transformation, or, intermediate, changes, which, it, affects, instantly, obeyed, the, order, and, appeared, in, the, form, of, creatures, and, thus, far, the, fable, reaches, of, proteus, and, his, flock, at, liberty, and, unrestrained, for, the, universe, with, the, common, structures, and, fabrics, of, the, creatures, is, the, face, of, matter, not, under, constraint, or, as, the, flock, wrought, upon, and, tortured, by, human, means, but, if, any, skilful, minister, of, nature, shall, apply, force, to, matter, and, by, design, torture, and, vex, it, in, order, to, its, annihilation, it, on, the, contrary, being, brought, under, this, necessity, changes, and, transforms, itself, into, a, strange, variety, of, shapes, and, appearances, for, nothing, but, the, power, of, the, creator, can, annihilate, or, truly, destroy, it, so, that, at, length, running, through, the, whole, circle, of, transformations, and, completing, its, period, it, in, some, degree, restores, itself, if, the, force, be, continued, and, that, method, of, binding, torturing, or, detaining, will, prove, the, most, effectual, and, expeditious, which, makes, use, of, manacles, and, fetters, that, is, lays, hold, and, works, upon, matter, in, the, extremest, degrees, the, addition, in, the, fable, that, makes, proteus, a, prophet, who, had, the, knowledge, of, things, past, present, and, future, excellently, agrees, with, the, nature, of, matter, as, he, who, knows, the, properties, the, changes, and, the, processes, of, matter, must, of, necessity, understand, the, effects, and, sum, of, what, it, does, has, done, or, can, do, though, his, knowledge, extends, not, to, all, the, parts, and, particulars, thereof, the, poets, made, memnon, the, son, of, aurora, and, bring, him, to, the, trojan, war, in, beautiful, armor, and, flushed, with, popular, praise, where, thirsting, after, further, glory, and, rashly, hurrying, on, to, the, greatest, enterprises, he, engages, the, bravest, warrior, of, all, the, greeks, achilles, and, falls, by, his, hand, in, single, combat, jupiter, in, commiseration, of, his, death, sent, birds, to, grace, his, funeral, that, perpetually, chanted, certain, mournful, and, bewailing, dirges, it, is, also, reported, that, the, rays, of, the, rising, sun, striking, his, statue, used, to, give, a, lamenting, sound, —this, fable, regards, the, unfortunate, end, of, those, promising, youths, who, like, sons, of, the, morning, elate, with, empty, hopes, and, glittering, outsides, attempt, things, beyond, their, strength, challenge, the, bravest, heroes, provoke, them, to, the, combat, and, proving, unequal, die, in, their, high, attempts, the, death, of, such, youths, seldom, fails, to, meet, with, infinite, pity, as, no, mortal, calamity, is, more, moving, and, afflicting, than, to, see, the, flower, of, virtue, cropped, before, its, time, nay, the, prime, of, life, enjoyed, to, the, full, or, even, to, a, degree, of, envy, does, not, assuage, or, moderate, the, grief, occasioned, by, the, untimely, death, of, such, hopeful, youths, but, lamentations, and, bewailings, fly, like, mournful, birds, about, their, tombs, for, a, long, while, after, especially, upon, all, fresh, occasions, new, commotions, and, the, beginning, of, great, actions, the, passionate, desire, of, them, is, renewed, as, by, the, sun’s, morning, rays, it, is, elegantly, fabled, by, tythonus, that, being, exceedingly, beloved, by, aurora, she, petitioned, jupiter, that, he, might, prove, immortal, thereby, to, secure, herself, the, everlasting, enjoyment, of, his, company, but, through, female, inadvertence, she, forgot, to, add, that, he, might, never, grow, old, so, that, though, he, proved, immortal, he, became, miserably, worn, and, consumed, with, age, insomuch, that, jupiter, out, of, pity, at, length, transformed, him, to, a, grasshopper, —this, fable, seems, to, contain, an, ingenious, description, of, pleasure, which, at, first, as, it, were, in, the, morning, of, the, day, is, so, welcome, that, men, pray, to, have, it, everlasting, but, forget, that, satiety, and, weariness, of, it, will, like, old, age, overtake, them, though, they, think, not, of, it, so, that, at, length, when, their, appetite, for, pleasurable, actions, is, gone, their, desires, and, affections, often, continue, whence, we, commonly, find, that, aged, persons, delight, themselves, with, the, discourse, and, remembrance, of, the, things, agreeable, to, them, in, their, better, days, this, is, very, remarkable, in, men, of, a, loose, and, men, of, a, military, life, the, former, whereof, are, always, talking, over, their, amours, and, the, latter, the, exploits, of, their, youth, like, grasshoppers, that, show, their, vigor, only, by, their, chirping, the, poets, tell, us, that, jupiter, to, carry, on, his, love-intrigues, assumed, many, different, shapes, as, of, a, bull, an, eagle, a, swan, a, golden, shower, &c, but, when, he, attempted, juno, he, turned, himself, into, the, most, ignoble, and, ridiculous, creature, —even, that, of, a, wretched, wet, weather-beaten, affrighted, trembling, and, half-starved, cuckoo, —this, is, a, wise, fable, and, drawn, from, the, very, entrails, of, morality, the, moral, is, that, men, should, not, be, conceited, of, themselves, and, imagine, that, a, discovery, of, their, excellences, will, always, render, them, acceptable, for, this, can, only, succeed, according, to, the, nature, and, manners, of, the, person, they, court, or, solicit, who, if, he, be, a, man, not, of, the, same, gifts, and, endowments, but, altogether, of, a, haughty, and, contemptuous, behavior, here, represented, by, the, person, of, juno, they, must, entirely, drop, the, character, that, carries, the, least, show, of, worth, or, gracefulness, if, they, proceed, upon, any, other, footing, it, is, downright, folly, nor, is, it, sufficient, to, act, the, deformity, of, obsequiousness, unless, they, really, change, themselves, and, become, abject, and, contemptible, in, their, persons, the, particulars, related, by, the, poets, of, cupid, or, love, do, not, properly, agree, to, the, same, person, yet, they, differ, only, so, far, that, if, the, confusion, of, persons, be, rejected, the, correspondence, may, hold, they, say, that, love, was, the, most, ancient, of, all, the, gods, and, existed, before, every, thing, else, except, chaos, which, is, held, coeval, therewith, but, for, chaos, the, ancients, never, paid, divine, honors, nor, gave, the, title, of, a, god, thereto, love, is, represented, absolutely, without, progenitor, excepting, only, that, he, is, said, to, have, proceeded, from, the, egg, of, nox, but, that, himself, begot, the, gods, and, all, things, else, on, chaos, his, attributes, are, four, viz, 1, perpetual, infancy, 2, blindness, 3, nakedness, and, 4, archery, there, was, also, another, cupid, or, love, the, youngest, son, of, the, gods, born, of, venus, and, upon, him, the, attributes, of, the, elder, are, transferred, with, some, degree, of, correspondence, —this, fable, points, at, and, enters, the, cradle, of, nature, love, seems, to, be, the, appetite, or, incentive, of, the, primitive, matter, or, to, speak, more, distinctly, the, natural, motion, or, moving, principle, of, the, original, corpuscles, or, atoms, this, being, the, most, ancient, and, only, power, that, made, and, wrought, all, things, out, of, matter, it, is, absolutely, without, parent, that, is, without, cause, for, causes, are, as, parents, to, effects, but, this, power, or, efficacy, could, have, no, natural, cause, for, excepting, god, nothing, was, before, it, and, therefore, it, could, have, no, efficient, in, nature, and, as, nothing, is, more, inward, with, nature, it, can, neither, be, a, genus, nor, a, form, and, therefore, whatever, it, is, it, must, be, somewhat, positive, though, inexpressible, and, if, it, were, possible, to, conceive, its, modus, and, process, yet, it, could, not, be, known, from, its, cause, as, being, next, to, god, the, cause, of, causes, and, itself, without, a, cause, and, perhaps, we, are, not, to, hope, that, the, modus, of, it, should, fall, or, be, comprehended, under, human, inquiry, whence, it, is, properly, feigned, to, be, the, egg, of, nox, or, laid, in, the, dark, the, divine, philosopher, declares, that, “god, has, made, every, thing, beautiful, in, its, season, and, has, given, over, the, world, to, our, disputes, and, inquiries, but, that, man, cannot, find, out, the, work, which, god, has, wrought, from, its, beginning, up, to, its, end, ”, thus, the, summary, or, collective, law, of, nature, or, the, principle, of, love, impressed, by, god, upon, the, original, particles, of, all, things, so, as, to, make, them, attack, each, other, and, come, together, by, the, repetition, and, multiplication, whereof, all, the, variety, in, the, universe, is, produced, can, scarce, possibly, find, full, admittance, into, the, thoughts, of, men, though, some, faint, notion, may, be, had, thereof, the, greek, philosophy, is, subtile, and, busied, in, discovering, the, material, principles, of, things, but, negligent, and, languid, in, discovering, the, principles, of, motion, in, which, the, energy, and, efficacy, of, every, operation, consists, and, here, the, greek, philosophers, seem, perfectly, blind, and, childish, for, the, opinion, of, the, peripatetics, as, to, the, stimulus, of, matter, by, privation, is, little, more, than, words, or, rather, sound, than, signification, and, they, who, refer, it, to, god, though, they, do, well, therein, yet, they, do, it, by, a, start, and, not, by, proper, degrees, of, assent, for, doubtless, there, is, one, summary, or, capital, law, in, which, nature, meets, subordinate, to, god, viz, the, law, mentioned, in, the, passage, above, quoted, from, solomon, or, the, work, which, god, has, wrought, from, its, beginning, to, its, end, democritus, who, further, considered, this, subject, having, first, supposed, an, atom, or, corpuscle, of, some, dimension, or, figure, attributed, thereto, an, appetite, desire, or, first, motion, simply, and, another, comparatively, imagining, that, all, things, properly, tended, to, the, centre, of, the, world, those, containing, more, matter, falling, faster, to, the, centre, and, thereby, removing, and, in, the, shock, driving, away, such, as, held, less, but, this, is, a, slender, conceit, and, regards, too, few, particulars, for, neither, the, revolutions, of, the, celestial, bodies, nor, the, contractions, and, expansions, of, things, can, be, reduced, to, this, principle, and, for, the, opinion, of, epicurus, as, to, the, declination, and, fortuitous, agitation, of, atoms, this, only, brings, the, matter, back, again, to, a, trifle, and, wraps, it, up, in, ignorance, and, night, cupid, is, elegantly, drawn, a, perpetual, child, for, compounds, are, larger, things, and, have, their, periods, of, age, but, the, first, seeds, or, atoms, of, bodies, are, small, and, remain, in, a, perpetual, infant, state, he, is, again, justly, represented, naked, as, all, compounds, may, properly, be, said, to, be, dressed, and, clothed, or, to, assume, a, personage, whence, nothing, remains, truly, naked, but, the, original, particles, of, things, the, blindness, of, cupid, contains, a, deep, allegory, for, this, same, cupid, love, or, appetite, of, the, world, seems, to, have, very, little, foresight, but, directs, his, steps, and, motions, conformably, to, what, he, finds, next, him, as, blind, men, do, when, they, feel, out, their, way, which, renders, the, divine, and, overruling, providence, and, foresight, the, more, surprising, as, by, a, certain, steady, law, it, brings, such, a, beautiful, order, and, regularity, of, things, out, of, what, seems, extremely, casual, void, of, design, and, as, it, were, really, blind, the, last, attribute, of, cupid, is, archery, viz, a, virtue, or, power, operating, at, a, distance, for, every, thing, that, operates, at, a, distance, may, seem, as, it, were, to, dart, or, shoot, with, arrows, and, whoever, allows, of, atoms, and, vacuity, necessarily, supposes, that, the, virtue, of, atoms, operates, at, a, distance, for, without, this, operation, no, motion, could, be, excited, on, account, of, the, vacuum, interposing, but, all, things, would, remain, sluggish, and, unmoved, as, to, the, other, cupid, he, is, properly, said, to, be, the, youngest, son, of, the, gods, as, his, power, could, not, take, place, before, the, formation, of, species, or, particular, bodies, the, description, given, us, of, him, transfers, the, allegory, to, morality, though, he, still, retains, some, resemblance, with, the, ancient, cupid, for, as, venus, universally, excites, the, affection, of, association, and, the, desire, of, procreation, her, son, cupid, applies, the, affection, to, individuals, so, that, the, general, disposition, proceeds, from, venus, but, the, more, close, sympathy, from, cupid, the, former, depends, upon, a, near, approximation, of, causes, but, the, latter, upon, deeper, more, necessitating, and, uncontrollable, principles, as, if, they, proceeded, from, the, ancient, cupid, on, whom, all, exquisite, sympathies, depend, diomed, acquired, great, glory, and, honor, at, the, trojan, war, and, was, highly, favored, by, pallas, who, encouraged, and, excited, him, by, no, means, to, spare, venus, if, he, should, casually, meet, her, in, fight, he, followed, the, advice, with, too, much, eagerness, and, intrepidity, and, accordingly, wounded, that, goddess, in, her, hand, this, presumptuous, action, remained, unpunished, for, a, time, and, when, the, war, was, ended, he, returned, with, great, glory, and, renown, to, his, own, country, where, finding, himself, embroiled, with, domestic, affairs, he, retired, into, italy, here, also, at, first, he, was, well, received, and, nobly, entertained, by, king, daunus, who, besides, other, gifts, and, honors, erected, statues, for, him, over, all, his, dominions, but, upon, the, first, calamity, that, afflicted, the, people, after, the, stranger’s, arrival, daunus, immediately, reflected, that, he, entertained, a, devoted, person, in, his, palace, an, enemy, to, the, gods, and, one, who, had, sacrilegiously, wounded, a, goddess, with, his, sword, whom, it, was, impious, but, to, touch, to, expiate, therefore, his, country’s, guilt, he, without, regard, to, the, laws, of, hospitality, which, were, less, regarded, by, him, than, the, laws, of, religion, directly, slew, his, guest, and, commanded, his, statues, and, all, his, honors, to, be, razed, and, abolished, nor, was, it, safe, for, others, to, commiserate, or, bewail, so, cruel, a, destiny, but, even, his, companions, in, arms, whilst, they, lamented, the, death, of, their, leader, and, filled, all, places, with, their, complaints, were, turned, into, a, kind, of, swans, which, are, said, at, the, approach, of, their, own, death, to, chant, sweet, melancholy, dirges, —this, fable, intimates, an, extraordinary, and, almost, singular, thing, for, no, hero, besides, diomed, is, recorded, to, have, wounded, any, of, the, gods, doubtless, we, have, here, described, the, nature, and, fate, of, a, man, who, professedly, makes, any, divine, worship, or, sect, of, religion, though, in, itself, vain, and, light, the, only, scope, of, his, actions, and, resolves, to, propagate, it, by, fire, and, sword, for, although, the, bloody, dissensions, and, differences, about, religion, were, unknown, to, the, ancients, yet, so, copious, and, diffusive, was, their, knowledge, that, what, they, knew, not, by, experience, they, comprehended, in, thought, and, representation, those, therefore, who, endeavor, to, reform, or, establish, any, sect, of, religion, though, vain, corrupt, and, infamous, (which, is, here, denoted, under, the, person, of, venus), not, by, the, force, of, reason, learning, sanctity, of, manners, the, weight, of, arguments, and, examples, but, would, spread, or, extirpate, it, by, persecution, pains, penalties, tortures, fire, and, sword, may, perhaps, be, instigated, hereto, by, pallas, that, is, by, a, certain, rigid, prudential, consideration, and, a, severity, of, judgment, by, the, vigor, and, efficacy, whereof, they, see, thoroughly, into, the, fallacies, and, fictions, of, the, delusions, of, this, kind, and, through, aversion, to, depravity, and, a, well-meant, zeal, these, men, usually, for, a, time, acquire, great, fame, and, glory, and, are, by, the, vulgar, to, whom, no, moderate, measures, can, be, acceptable, extolled, and, almost, adored, as, the, only, patrons, and, protectors, of, truth, and, religion, men, of, any, other, disposition, seeming, in, comparison, with, these, to, be, lukewarm, mean-spirited, and, cowardly, this, fame, and, felicity, however, seldom, endures, to, the, end, but, all, violence, unless, it, escapes, the, reverses, and, changes, of, things, by, untimely, death, is, commonly, unprosperous, in, the, issue, and, if, a, change, of, affairs, happens, and, that, sect, of, religion, which, was, persecuted, and, oppressed, gains, strength, and, rises, again, then, the, zeal, and, warm, endeavors, of, this, sort, of, men, are, condemned, their, very, name, becomes, odious, and, all, their, honors, terminate, in, disgrace, as, to, the, point, that, diomed, should, be, slain, by, his, hospitable, entertainer, this, denotes, that, religious, dissensions, may, cause, treachery, bloody, animosities, and, deceit, even, between, the, nearest, friends, that, complaining, or, bewailing, should, not, in, so, enormous, a, case, be, permitted, to, friends, affected, by, the, catastrophe, without, punishment, includes, this, prudent, admonition, that, almost, in, all, kinds, of, wickedness, and, depravity, men, have, still, room, left, for, commiseration, so, that, they, who, hate, the, crime, may, yet, pity, the, person, and, bewail, his, calamity, from, a, principle, of, humanity, and, good-nature, and, to, forbid, the, overflowings, and, intercourses, of, pity, upon, such, occasions, were, the, extremest, of, evils, yet, in, the, cause, of, religion, and, impiety, the, very, commiserations, of, men, are, noted, and, suspected, on, the, other, hand, the, lamentations, and, complainings, of, the, followers, and, attendants, of, diomed, that, is, of, men, of, the, same, sect, or, persuasion, are, usually, very, sweet, agreeable, and, moving, like, the, dying, notes, of, swans, or, the, birds, of, diomed, this, also, is, a, noble, and, remarkable, part, of, the, allegory, denoting, that, the, last, words, of, those, who, suffer, for, the, sake, of, religion, strongly, affect, and, sway, men’s, minds, and, leave, a, lasting, impression, upon, the, sense, and, memory, the, ancients, have, left, us, a, description, of, mechanical, skill, industry, and, curious, arts, converted, to, ill, uses, in, the, person, of, dædalus, a, most, ingenious, but, execrable, artist, this, dædalus, was, banished, for, the, murder, of, his, brother, artist, and, rival, yet, found, a, kind, reception, in, his, banishment, from, the, kings, and, states, where, he, came, he, raised, many, incomparable, edifices, to, the, honor, of, the, gods, and, invented, many, new, contrivances, for, the, beautifying, and, ennobling, of, cities, and, public, places, but, still, he, was, most, famous, for, wicked, inventions, among, the, rest, by, his, abominable, industry, and, destructive, genius, he, assisted, in, the, fatal, and, infamous, production, of, the, monster, minotaur, that, devourer, of, promising, youths, and, then, to, cover, one, mischief, with, another, and, provide, for, the, security, of, this, monster, he, invented, and, built, a, labyrinth, a, work, infamous, for, its, end, and, design, but, admirable, and, prodigious, for, art, and, workmanship, after, this, that, he, might, not, only, be, celebrated, for, wicked, inventions, but, be, sought, after, as, well, for, prevention, as, for, instruments, of, mischief, he, formed, that, ingenious, device, of, his, clue, which, led, directly, through, all, the, windings, of, the, labyrinth, this, dædalus, was, persecuted, by, minos, with, the, utmost, severity, diligence, and, inquiry, but, he, always, found, refuge, and, means, of, escaping, lastly, endeavoring, to, teach, his, son, icarus, the, art, of, flying, the, novice, trusting, too, much, to, his, wings, fell, from, his, towering, flight, and, was, drowned, in, the, sea, —the, sense, of, the, fable, runs, thus, it, first, denotes, envy, which, is, continually, upon, the, watch, and, strangely, prevails, among, excellent, artificers, for, no, kind, of, people, are, observed, to, be, more, implacably, and, destructively, envious, to, one, another, than, these, in, the, next, place, it, observes, an, impolitic, and, improvident, kind, of, punishment, inflicted, upon, dædalus—that, of, banishment, for, good, workmen, are, gladly, received, everywhere, so, that, banishment, to, an, excellent, artificer, is, scarce, any, punishment, at, all, whereas, other, conditions, of, life, cannot, easily, flourish, from, home, for, the, admiration, of, artists, is, propagated, and, increased, among, foreigners, and, strangers, it, being, a, principle, in, the, minds, of, men, to, slight, and, despise, the, mechanical, operators, of, their, own, nation, the, succeeding, part, of, the, fable, is, plain, concerning, the, use, of, mechanic, arts, whereto, human, life, stands, greatly, indebted, as, receiving, from, this, treasury, numerous, particulars, for, the, service, of, religion, the, ornament, of, civil, society, and, the, whole, provision, and, apparatus, of, life, but, then, the, same, magazine, supplies, instruments, of, lust, cruelty, and, death, for, not, to, mention, the, arts, of, luxury, and, debauchery, we, plainly, see, how, far, the, business, of, exquisite, poisons, guns, engines, of, war, and, such, kind, of, destructive, inventions, exceeds, the, cruelty, and, barbarity, of, the, minotaur, himself, the, addition, of, the, labyrinth, contains, a, beautiful, allegory, representing, the, nature, of, mechanic, arts, in, general, for, all, ingenious, and, accurate, mechanical, inventions, may, be, conceived, as, a, labyrinth, which, by, reason, of, their, subtilty, intricacy, crossing, and, interfering, with, one, another, and, the, apparent, resemblances, they, have, among, themselves, scarce, any, power, of, the, judgment, can, unravel, and, distinguish, so, that, they, are, only, to, be, understood, and, traced, by, the, clue, of, experience, it, is, no, less, prudently, added, that, he, who, invented, the, windings, of, the, labyrinth, should, also, show, the, use, and, management, of, the, clue, for, mechanical, arts, have, an, ambiguous, or, double, use, and, serve, as, well, to, produce, as, to, prevent, mischief, and, destruction, so, that, their, virtue, almost, destroys, or, unwinds, itself, unlawful, arts, and, indeed, frequently, arts, themselves, are, persecuted, by, minos, that, is, by, laws, which, prohibit, and, forbid, their, use, among, the, people, but, notwithstanding, this, they, are, hid, concealed, retained, and, everywhere, find, reception, and, skulking-places, a, thing, well, observed, by, tacitus, of, the, astrologers, and, fortune-tellers, of, his, time, “these, ”, says, he, “are, a, kind, of, men, that, will, always, be, prohibited, and, yet, will, always, be, retained, in, our, city, ”, but, lastly, all, unlawful, and, vain, arts, of, what, kind, soever, lose, their, reputation, in, tract, of, time, grow, contemptible, and, perish, through, their, overconfidence, like, icarus, being, commonly, unable, to, perform, what, they, boasted, and, to, say, the, truth, such, arts, are, better, suppressed, by, their, own, vain, pretensions, than, checked, or, restrained, by, the, bridle, of, laws, [632], the, poets, feign, that, vulcan, attempted, the, chastity, of, minerva, and, impatient, of, refusal, had, recourse, to, force, the, consequence, of, which, was, the, birth, of, ericthonius, whose, body, from, the, middle, upwards, was, comely, and, well-proportioned, but, his, thighs, and, legs, small, shrunk, and, deformed, like, an, eel, conscious, of, this, defect, he, became, the, inventor, of, chariots, so, as, to, show, the, graceful, but, conceal, the, deformed, part, of, his, body, —this, strange, fable, seems, to, carry, this, meaning, art, is, here, represented, under, the, person, of, vulcan, by, reason, of, the, various, uses, it, makes, of, fire, and, nature, under, the, person, of, minerva, by, reason, of, the, industry, employed, in, her, works, art, therefore, whenever, it, offers, violence, to, nature, in, order, to, conquer, subdue, and, bend, her, to, its, purpose, by, tortures, and, force, of, all, kinds, seldom, obtains, the, end, proposed, yet, upon, great, struggle, and, application, there, proceed, certain, imperfect, births, or, lame, abortive, works, specious, in, appearance, but, weak, and, unstable, in, use, which, are, nevertheless, with, great, pomp, and, deceitful, appearances, triumphantly, carried, about, and, shown, by, impostors, procedure, very, familiar, and, remarkable, in, chemical, productions, and, new, mechanical, inventions, especially, when, the, inventors, rather, hug, their, errors, than, improve, upon, them, and, go, on, struggling, with, nature, not, courting, her, the, poets, tell, us, that, the, inhabitants, of, the, old, world, being, totally, destroyed, by, the, universal, deluge, excepting, deucalion, and, pyrrha, these, two, desiring, with, zealous, and, fervent, devotion, to, restore, mankind, received, this, oracle, for, answer, that, “they, should, succeed, by, throwing, their, mother’s, bones, behind, them, ”, this, at, first, cast, them, into, great, sorrow, and, despair, because, as, all, things, were, levelled, by, the, deluge, it, was, in, vain, to, seek, their, mother’s, tomb, but, at, length, they, understood, the, expression, of, the, oracle, to, signify, the, stones, of, the, earth, which, is, esteemed, the, mother, of, all, things, —this, fable, seems, to, reveal, a, secret, of, nature, and, correct, an, error, familiar, to, the, mind, for, men’s, ignorance, leads, them, to, expect, the, renovation, or, restoration, of, things, from, their, corruption, and, remains, as, the, phœnix, is, said, to, be, restored, out, of, its, ashes, which, is, a, very, improper, procedure, because, such, kind, of, materials, have, finished, their, course, and, are, become, absolutely, unfit, to, supply, the, first, rudiments, of, the, same, things, again, whence, in, cases, of, renovation, recourse, should, be, had, to, more, common, principles, nemesis, is, represented, as, a, goddess, venerated, by, all, but, feared, by, the, powerful, and, the, fortunate, she, is, said, to, be, the, daughter, of, nox, and, oceanus, she, is, drawn, with, wings, and, a, crown, a, javelin, of, ash, in, her, right, hand, a, glass, containing, ethiopians, in, her, left, and, riding, upon, a, stag, —the, fable, receives, this, explanation, the, word, nemesis, manifestly, signifies, revenge, or, retribution, for, the, office, of, this, goddess, consisted, in, interposing, like, the, roman, tribunes, with, an, forbid, it, ”, in, all, courses, of, constant, and, perpetual, felicity, so, as, not, only, to, chastise, haughtiness, but, also, to, repay, even, innocent, and, moderate, happiness, with, adversity, as, if, it, were, decreed, that, none, of, human, race, should, be, admitted, to, the, banquet, of, the, gods, but, for, sport, and, indeed, to, read, over, that, chapter, of, pliny, wherein, he, has, collected, the, miseries, and, misfortunes, of, augustus, cæsar, whom, of, all, mankind, one, would, judge, most, fortunate, —as, he, had, a, certain, art, of, using, and, enjoying, prosperity, with, a, mind, no, way, tumid, light, effeminate, confused, or, melancholic, —one, cannot, but, think, this, a, very, great, and, powerful, goddess, who, could, bring, such, a, victim, to, her, altar, [633], the, parents, of, this, goddess, were, oceanus, and, nox, that, is, the, fluctuating, change, of, things, and, the, obscure, and, secret, divine, decrees, the, changes, of, things, are, aptly, represented, by, the, ocean, on, account, of, its, perpetual, ebbing, and, flowing, and, secret, providence, is, justly, expressed, by, night, even, the, heathens, have, observed, this, secret, nemesis, of, the, night, or, the, difference, betwixt, divine, and, human, judgment, [634], wings, are, given, to, nemesis, because, of, the, sudden, and, unforeseen, changes, of, things, for, from, the, earliest, account, of, time, it, has, been, common, for, great, and, prudent, men, to, fall, by, the, dangers, they, most, despised, thus, cicero, when, admonished, by, brutus, of, the, infidelity, and, rancor, of, octavius, coolly, wrote, back, cannot, however, but, be, obliged, to, you, brutus, as, ought, for, informing, me, though, of, such, a, trifle, ”[635], nemesis, also, has, her, crown, by, reason, of, the, invidious, and, malignant, nature, of, the, vulgar, who, generally, rejoice, triumph, and, crown, her, at, the, fall, of, the, fortunate, and, the, powerful, and, for, the, javelin, in, her, right, hand, it, has, regard, to, those, whom, she, has, actually, struck, and, transfixed, but, whoever, escapes, her, stroke, or, feels, not, actual, calamity, or, misfortune, she, affrights, with, a, black, and, dismal, sight, in, her, left, hand, for, doubtless, mortals, on, the, highest, pinnacle, of, felicity, have, a, prospect, of, death, diseases, calamities, perfidious, friends, undermining, enemies, reverses, of, fortune, &c, represented, by, the, ethiopians, in, her, glass, thus, virgil, with, great, elegance, describing, the, battle, of, actium, says, of, cleopatra, that, “she, did, not, yet, perceive, the, two, asps, behind, her, ”[636], but, soon, after, which, way, soever, she, turned, she, saw, whole, troops, of, ethiopians, still, before, her, lastly, it, is, significantly, added, that, nemesis, rides, upon, a, stag, which, is, a, very, long-lived, creature, for, though, perhaps, some, by, an, untimely, death, in, youth, may, prevent, or, escape, this, goddess, yet, they, who, enjoy, a, long, flow, of, happiness, and, power, doubtless, become, subject, to, her, at, length, and, are, brought, to, yield, the, ancients, relate, that, hercules, and, achelous, being, rivals, in, the, courtship, of, deianira, the, matter, was, contested, by, single, combat, when, achelous, having, transformed, himself, as, he, had, power, to, do, into, various, shapes, by, way, of, trial, at, length, in, the, form, of, a, fierce, wild, bull, prepares, himself, for, the, fight, but, hercules, still, retains, his, human, shape, engages, sharply, with, him, and, in, the, issue, broke, off, one, of, the, bull’s, horns, and, now, achelous, in, great, pain, and, fright, to, redeem, his, horn, presents, hercules, with, the, cornucopia, —this, fable, relates, to, military, expeditions, and, preparations, for, the, preparation, of, war, on, the, defensive, side, here, denoted, by, achelous, appears, in, various, shapes, whilst, the, invading, side, has, but, one, simple, form, consisting, either, in, an, army, or, perhaps, a, fleet, but, the, country, that, expects, the, invasion, is, employed, infinite, ways, in, fortifying, towns, blockading, passes, rivers, and, ports, raising, soldiers, disposing, garrisons, building, and, breaking, down, bridges, procuring, aids, securing, provisions, arms, ammunition, &c, so, that, there, appears, a, new, face, of, things, every, day, and, at, length, when, the, country, is, sufficiently, fortified, and, prepared, it, represents, to, the, life, the, form, and, threats, of, a, fierce, fighting, bull, on, the, other, side, the, invader, presses, on, to, the, fight, fearing, to, be, distressed, in, an, enemy’s, country, and, if, after, the, battle, he, remains, master, of, the, field, and, has, now, broke, as, it, were, the, horn, of, his, enemy, the, besieged, of, course, retire, inglorious, affrighted, and, dismayed, to, their, stronghold, there, endeavoring, to, secure, themselves, and, repair, their, strength, leaving, at, the, same, time, their, country, a, prey, to, the, conqueror, which, is, well, expressed, by, the, amalthean, horn, or, cornucopia, [637], the, fable, runs, that, semele, jupiter’s, mistress, having, bound, him, by, an, inviolable, oath, to, grant, her, an, unknown, request, desired, he, would, embrace, her, in, the, same, form, and, manner, he, used, to, embrace, juno, and, the, promise, being, irrevocable, she, was, burnt, to, death, with, lightning, in, the, performance, the, embryo, however, was, sewed, up, and, carried, in, jupiter’s, thigh, till, the, complete, time, of, its, birth, but, the, burden, thus, rendering, the, father, lame, and, causing, him, pain, the, child, was, thence, called, dionysus, when, born, he, was, committed, for, some, years, to, be, nursed, by, proserpina, and, when, grown, up, appeared, with, so, effeminate, a, face, that, his, sex, seemed, somewhat, doubtful, he, also, died, and, was, buried, for, a, time, but, afterwards, revived, when, a, youth, he, first, introduced, the, cultivation, and, dressing, of, vines, the, method, of, preparing, wine, and, taught, the, use, thereof, whence, becoming, famous, he, subdued, the, world, even, to, the, utmost, bounds, of, the, indies, he, rode, in, a, chariot, drawn, by, tigers, there, danced, about, him, certain, deformed, demons, called, cobali, &c, the, muses, also, joined, in, his, train, he, married, ariadne, who, was, deserted, by, theseus, the, ivy, was, sacred, to, him, he, was, also, held, the, inventor, and, institutor, of, religious, rites, and, ceremonies, but, such, as, were, wild, frantic, and, full, of, corruption, and, cruelty, he, had, also, the, power, of, striking, men, with, frenzies, pentheus, and, orpheus, were, torn, to, pieces, by, the, frantic, women, at, his, orgies, the, first, for, climbing, a, tree, to, behold, their, outrageous, ceremonies, and, the, other, for, the, music, of, his, harp, but, the, acts, of, this, god, are, much, entangled, and, confounded, with, those, of, jupiter, —this, fable, seems, to, contain, a, little, system, of, morality, so, that, there, is, scarce, any, better, invention, in, all, ethics, under, the, history, of, bacchus, is, drawn, the, nature, of, unlawful, desire, or, affection, and, disorder, for, the, appetite, and, thirst, of, apparent, good, is, the, mother, of, all, unlawful, desire, though, ever, so, destructive, and, all, unlawful, desires, are, conceived, in, unlawful, wishes, or, requests, rashly, indulged, or, granted, before, they, are, well, understood, or, considered, and, when, the, affection, begins, to, grow, warm, the, mother, of, it, (the, nature, of, good), is, destroyed, and, burnt, up, by, the, heat, and, whilst, an, unlawful, desire, lies, in, the, embryo, or, unripened, in, the, mind, which, is, its, father, and, here, represented, by, jupiter, it, is, cherished, and, concealed, especially, in, the, inferior, part, of, the, mind, corresponding, to, the, thigh, of, the, body, where, pain, twitches, and, depresses, the, mind, so, far, as, to, render, its, resolutions, and, actions, imperfect, and, lame, and, even, after, this, child, of, the, mind, is, confirmed, and, gains, strength, by, consent, and, habit, and, comes, forth, into, action, it, must, still, be, nursed, by, proserpina, for, a, time, that, is, it, skulks, and, hides, its, head, in, a, clandestine, manner, as, it, were, under, ground, till, at, length, when, the, checks, of, shame, and, fear, are, removed, and, the, requisite, boldness, acquired, it, either, assumes, the, pretext, of, some, virtue, or, openly, despises, infamy, and, it, is, justly, observed, that, every, vehement, passion, appears, of, a, doubtful, sex, as, having, the, strength, of, a, man, at, first, but, at, last, the, impotence, of, a, woman, it, is, also, excellently, added, that, bacchus, died, and, rose, again, for, the, affections, sometimes, seem, to, die, and, be, no, more, but, there, is, no, trusting, them, even, though, they, were, buried, being, always, apt, and, ready, to, rise, again, whenever, the, occasion, or, object, offers, that, bacchus, should, be, the, inventor, of, wine, carries, a, fine, allegory, with, it, for, every, affection, is, cunning, and, subtle, in, discovering, a, proper, matter, to, nourish, and, feed, it, and, of, all, things, known, to, mortals, wine, is, the, most, powerful, and, effectual, for, exciting, and, inflaming, passions, of, all, kinds, being, indeed, like, a, common, fuel, to, all, it, is, again, with, great, elegance, observed, of, bacchus, that, he, subdued, provinces, and, undertook, endless, expeditions, for, the, affections, never, rest, satisfied, with, what, they, enjoy, but, with, an, endless, and, insatiable, appetite, thirst, after, something, further, and, tigers, are, prettily, feigned, to, draw, the, chariot, for, as, soon, as, any, affection, shall, from, going, on, foot, be, advanced, to, ride, it, triumphs, over, reason, and, exerts, its, cruelty, fierceness, and, strength, against, all, that, oppose, it, it, is, also, humorously, imagined, that, ridiculous, demons, dance, and, frisk, about, this, chariot, for, every, passion, produces, indecent, disorderly, interchangeable, and, deformed, motions, in, the, eyes, countenance, and, gesture, so, that, the, person, under, the, impulse, whether, of, anger, insult, love, &c, though, to, himself, he, may, seem, grand, lofty, or, obliging, yet, in, the, eyes, of, others, appears, mean, contemptible, or, ridiculous, the, muses, also, are, found, in, the, train, of, bacchus, for, there, is, scarce, any, passion, without, its, art, science, or, doctrine, to, court, and, flatter, it, but, in, this, respect, the, indulgence, of, men, of, genius, has, greatly, detracted, from, the, majesty, of, the, muses, who, ought, to, be, the, leaders, and, conductors, of, human, life, and, not, the, handmaids, of, the, passions, the, allegory, of, bacchus, falling, in, love, with, a, cast, mistress, is, extremely, noble, for, it, is, certain, that, the, affections, always, court, and, covet, what, has, been, rejected, upon, experience, and, all, those, who, by, serving, and, indulging, their, passions, immensely, raise, the, value, of, enjoyment, should, know, that, whatever, they, covet, and, pursue, whether, riches, pleasure, glory, learning, or, anything, else, they, only, pursue, those, things, that, have, been, forsaken, and, cast, off, with, contempt, by, great, numbers, in, all, ages, after, possession, and, experience, nor, is, it, without, a, mystery, that, the, ivy, was, sacred, to, bacchus, and, this, for, two, reasons, first, because, ivy, is, an, evergreen, or, flourishes, in, the, winter, and, secondly, because, it, winds, and, creeps, about, so, many, things, as, trees, walls, and, buildings, and, raises, itself, above, them, as, to, the, first, every, passion, grows, fresh, strong, and, vigorous, by, opposition, and, prohibition, as, it, were, by, a, kind, of, contrast, or, antiperistasis, like, the, ivy, in, the, winter, and, for, the, second, the, predominant, passion, of, the, mind, throws, itself, like, the, ivy, round, all, human, actions, entwines, all, our, resolutions, and, perpetually, adheres, to, and, mixes, itself, among, or, even, overtops, them, and, no, wonder, that, superstitious, rites, and, ceremonies, are, attributed, to, bacchus, when, almost, every, ungovernable, passion, grows, wanton, and, luxuriant, in, corrupt, religions, nor, again, that, fury, and, frenzy, should, be, sent, and, dealt, out, by, him, because, every, passion, is, a, short, frenzy, and, if, it, be, vehement, lasting, and, take, deep, root, it, terminates, in, madness, and, hence, the, allegory, of, pentheus, and, orpheus, being, torn, to, pieces, is, evident, for, every, headstrong, passion, is, extremely, bitter, severe, inveterate, and, revengeful, upon, all, curious, inquiry, wholesome, admonition, free, counsel, and, persuasion, lastly, the, confusion, between, the, persons, of, jupiter, and, bacchus, will, justly, admit, of, an, allegory, because, noble, and, meritorious, actions, may, sometimes, proceed, from, virtue, sound, reason, and, magnanimity, and, sometimes, again, from, a, concealed, passion, and, secret, desire, of, ill, however, they, may, be, extolled, and, praised, insomuch, that, it, is, not, easy, to, distinguish, betwixt, the, acts, of, bacchus, and, the, acts, of, jupiter, atalanta, who, was, exceedingly, fleet, contended, with, hippomenes, in, the, course, on, condition, that, if, hippomenes, won, he, should, espouse, her, or, forfeit, his, life, if, he, lost, the, match, was, very, unequal, for, atalanta, had, conquered, numbers, to, their, destruction, hippomenes, therefore, had, recourse, to, stratagem, he, procured, three, golden, apples, and, purposely, carried, them, with, him, they, started, atalanta, outstripped, him, soon, then, hippomenes, bowled, one, of, his, apples, before, her, across, the, course, in, order, not, only, to, make, her, stoop, but, to, draw, her, out, of, the, path, she, prompted, by, female, curiosity, and, the, beauty, of, the, golden, fruit, starts, from, the, course, to, take, up, the, apple, hippomenes, in, the, mean, time, holds, on, his, way, and, steps, before, her, but, she, by, her, natural, swiftness, soon, fetches, up, her, lost, ground, and, leaves, him, again, behind, hippomenes, however, by, rightly, timing, his, second, and, third, throw, at, length, won, the, race, not, by, his, swiftness, but, his, cunning, —this, fable, seems, to, contain, a, noble, allegory, of, the, contest, betwixt, art, and, nature, for, art, here, denoted, by, atalanta, is, much, swifter, or, more, expeditious, in, its, operations, than, nature, when, all, obstacles, and, impediments, are, removed, and, sooner, arrives, at, its, end, this, appears, almost, in, every, instance, thus, fruit, comes, slowly, from, the, kernel, but, soon, by, inoculation, or, incision, clay, left, to, itself, is, a, long, time, in, acquiring, a, stony, hardness, but, is, presently, burnt, by, fire, into, brick, so, again, in, human, life, nature, is, a, long, while, in, alleviating, and, abolishing, the, remembrance, of, pain, and, assuaging, the, troubles, of, the, mind, but, moral, philosophy, which, is, the, art, of, living, performs, it, presently, yet, this, prerogative, and, singular, efficacy, of, art, is, stopped, and, retarded, to, the, infinite, detriment, of, human, life, by, certain, golden, apples, for, there, is, no, one, science, or, art, that, constantly, holds, on, its, true, and, proper, course, to, the, end, but, they, are, all, continually, stopping, short, forsaking, the, track, and, turning, aside, to, profit, and, convenience, exactly, like, atalanta, [638], whence, it, is, no, wonder, that, art, gets, not, the, victory, over, nature, nor, according, to, the, condition, of, the, contest, brings, her, under, subjection, but, on, the, contrary, remains, subject, to, her, as, a, wife, to, a, husband, [639], the, ancients, relate, that, man, was, the, work, of, prometheus, and, formed, of, clay, only, the, artificer, mixed, in, with, the, mass, particles, taken, from, different, animals, and, being, desirous, to, improve, his, workmanship, and, endow, as, well, as, create, the, human, race, he, stole, up, to, heaven, with, a, bundle, of, birch-rods, and, kindling, them, at, the, chariot, of, the, sun, thence, brought, down, fire, to, the, earth, for, the, service, of, men, they, add, that, for, this, meritorious, act, prometheus, was, repayed, with, ingratitude, by, mankind, so, that, forming, a, conspiracy, they, arraigned, both, him, and, his, invention, before, jupiter, but, the, matter, was, otherwise, received, than, they, imagined, for, the, accusation, proved, extremely, grateful, to, jupiter, and, the, gods, insomuch, that, delighted, with, the, action, they, not, only, indulged, mankind, the, use, of, fire, but, moreover, conferred, upon, them, a, most, acceptable, and, desirable, present, viz, perpetual, youth, but, men, foolishly, overjoyed, hereat, laid, this, present, of, the, gods, upon, an, ass, who, in, returning, back, with, it, being, extremely, thirsty, strayed, to, a, fountain, the, serpent, who, was, guardian, thereof, would, not, suffer, him, to, drink, but, upon, condition, of, receiving, the, burden, he, carried, whatever, it, should, be, the, silly, ass, complied, and, thus, the, perpetual, renewal, of, youth, was, for, a, drop, of, water, transferred, from, men, to, the, race, of, serpents, prometheus, not, desisting, from, his, unwarrantable, practices, though, now, reconciled, to, mankind, after, they, were, thus, tricked, of, their, present, but, still, continuing, inveterate, against, jupiter, had, the, boldness, to, attempt, deceit, even, in, a, sacrifice, and, is, said, to, have, once, offered, up, two, bulls, to, jupiter, but, so, as, in, the, hide, of, one, of, them, to, wrap, all, the, flesh, and, fat, of, both, and, stuffing, out, the, other, hide, only, with, the, bones, then, in, a, religious, and, devout, manner, gave, jupiter, his, choice, of, the, two, jupiter, detesting, this, sly, fraud, and, hypocrisy, but, having, thus, an, opportunity, of, punishing, the, offender, purposely, chose, the, mock, bull, and, now, giving, way, to, revenge, but, finding, he, could, not, chastise, the, insolence, of, prometheus, without, afflicting, the, human, race, (in, the, production, whereof, prometheus, had, strangely, and, insufferably, prided, himself), he, commanded, vulcan, to, form, a, beautiful, and, graceful, woman, to, whom, every, god, presented, a, certain, gift, whence, she, was, called, pandora, [640], they, put, into, her, hands, an, elegant, box, containing, all, sorts, of, miseries, and, misfortunes, but, hope, was, placed, at, the, bottom, of, it, with, this, box, she, first, goes, to, prometheus, to, try, if, she, could, prevail, upon, him, to, receive, and, open, it, but, he, being, upon, his, guard, warily, refused, the, offer, upon, this, refusal, she, comes, to, his, brother, epimetheus, a, man, of, a, very, different, temper, who, rashly, and, inconsiderately, opens, the, box, when, finding, all, kinds, of, miseries, and, misfortunes, issued, out, of, it, he, grew, wise, too, late, and, with, great, hurry, and, struggle, endeavored, to, clap, the, cover, on, again, but, with, all, his, endeavor, could, scarce, keep, in, hope, which, lay, at, the, bottom, lastly, jupiter, arraigned, prometheus, of, many, heinous, crimes, as, that, he, formerly, stole, fire, from, heaven, that, he, contemptuously, and, deceitfully, mocked, him, by, a, sacrifice, of, bones, that, he, despised, his, present, [641], adding, withal, a, new, crime, that, he, attempted, to, ravish, pallas, for, all, which, he, was, sentenced, to, be, bound, in, chains, and, doomed, to, perpetual, torments, accordingly, by, jupiter’s, command, he, was, brought, to, mount, caucasus, and, there, fastened, to, a, pillar, so, firmly, that, he, could, no, way, stir, vulture, or, eagle, stood, by, him, which, in, the, daytime, gnawed, and, consumed, his, liver, but, in, the, night, the, wasted, parts, were, supplied, again, whence, matter, for, his, pain, was, never, wanting, they, relate, however, that, his, punishment, had, an, end, for, hercules, sailing, the, ocean, in, a, cup, or, pitcher, presented, him, by, the, sun, came, at, length, to, caucasus, shot, the, eagle, with, his, arrows, and, set, prometheus, free, in, certain, nations, also, there, were, instituted, particular, games, of, the, torch, to, the, honor, of, prometheus, in, which, they, who, ran, for, the, prize, carried, lighted, torches, and, as, any, one, of, these, torches, happened, to, go, out, the, bearer, withdrew, himself, and, gave, way, to, the, next, and, that, person, was, allowed, to, win, the, prize, who, first, brought, in, his, lighted, torch, to, the, goal, —this, fable, contains, and, enforces, many, just, and, serious, considerations, some, whereof, have, been, long, since, well, observed, but, some, again, remain, perfectly, untouched, prometheus, clearly, and, expressly, signifies, providence, for, of, all, the, things, in, nature, the, formation, and, endowment, of, man, was, singled, out, by, the, ancients, and, esteemed, the, peculiar, work, of, providence, the, reason, hereof, seems, that, the, nature, of, man, includes, a, mind, and, understanding, which, is, the, seat, of, providence, 2, that, it, is, harsh, and, incredible, to, suppose, reason, and, mind, should, be, raised, and, drawn, out, of, senseless, and, irrational, principles, whence, it, becomes, almost, inevitable, that, providence, is, implanted, in, the, human, mind, in, conformity, with, and, by, the, direction, and, the, design, of, the, greater, overruling, providence, but, 3, the, principal, cause, is, this, that, man, seems, to, be, the, thing, in, which, the, whole, world, centres, with, respect, to, final, causes, so, that, if, he, were, away, all, other, things, would, stray, and, fluctuate, without, end, or, intention, or, become, perfectly, disjointed, and, out, of, frame, for, all, things, are, made, subservient, to, man, and, he, receives, use, and, benefit, from, them, all, thus, the, revolutions, places, and, periods, of, the, celestial, bodies, serve, him, for, distinguishing, times, and, seasons, and, for, dividing, the, world, into, different, regions, the, meteors, afford, him, prognostications, of, the, weather, the, winds, sail, our, ships, drive, our, mills, and, move, our, machines, and, the, vegetables, and, animals, of, all, kinds, either, afford, us, matter, for, houses, and, habitations, clothing, food, physic, or, tend, to, ease, or, delight, to, support, or, refresh, us, so, that, everything, in, nature, seems, not, made, for, itself, but, for, man, and, it, is, not, without, reason, added, that, the, mass, of, matter, whereof, man, was, formed, should, be, mixed, up, with, particles, taken, from, different, animals, and, wrought, in, with, the, clay, because, it, is, certain, that, of, all, things, in, the, universe, man, is, the, most, compounded, and, recompounded, body, so, that, the, ancients, not, improperly, styled, him, a, microcosm, or, little, world, within, himself, for, although, the, chemists, have, absurdly, and, too, literally, wrested, and, perverted, the, elegance, of, the, term, microcosm, whilst, they, pretend, to, find, all, kind, of, mineral, and, vegetable, matters, or, something, corresponding, to, them, in, man, yet, it, remains, firm, and, unshaken, that, the, human, body, is, of, all, substances, the, most, mixed, and, organical, whence, it, has, surprising, powers, and, faculties, for, the, powers, of, simple, bodies, are, but, few, though, certain, and, quick, as, being, little, broken, or, weakened, and, not, counterbalanced, by, mixture, but, excellence, and, quantity, of, energy, reside, in, mixture, and, composition, man, however, in, his, first, origin, seems, to, be, a, defenceless, naked, creature, slow, in, assisting, himself, and, standing, in, need, of, numerous, things, prometheus, therefore, hastened, to, the, invention, of, fire, which, supplies, and, administers, to, nearly, all, human, uses, and, necessities, insomuch, that, if, the, soul, may, be, called, the, form, of, forms, if, the, hand, may, be, called, the, instrument, of, instruments, fire, may, as, properly, be, called, the, assistant, of, assistants, or, the, helper, of, helps, for, hence, proceed, numberless, operations, hence, all, the, mechanic, arts, and, hence, infinite, assistances, are, afforded, to, the, sciences, themselves, the, manner, wherein, prometheus, stole, this, fire, is, properly, described, from, the, nature, of, the, thing, he, being, said, to, have, done, it, by, applying, a, rod, of, birch, to, the, chariot, of, the, sun, for, birch, is, used, in, striking, and, beating, which, clearly, denotes, the, generation, of, fire, to, be, from, the, violent, percussions, and, collisions, of, bodies, whereby, the, matters, struck, are, subtilized, rarefied, put, into, motion, and, so, prepared, to, receive, the, heat, of, the, celestial, bodies, whence, they, in, a, clandestine, and, secret, manner, collect, and, snatch, fire, as, it, were, by, stealth, from, the, chariot, of, the, sun, the, next, is, a, remarkable, part, of, the, fable, which, represents, that, men, instead, of, gratitude, and, thanks, fell, into, indignation, and, expostulation, accusing, both, prometheus, and, his, fire, to, jupiter, —and, yet, the, accusation, proved, highly, pleasing, to, jupiter, so, that, he, for, this, reason, crowned, these, benefits, of, mankind, with, a, new, bounty, here, it, may, seem, strange, that, the, sin, of, ingratitude, to, a, creator, and, benefactor, a, sin, so, heinous, as, to, include, almost, all, others, should, meet, with, approbation, and, reward, but, the, allegory, has, another, view, and, denotes, that, the, accusation, and, arraignment, both, of, human, nature, and, human, art, among, mankind, proceeds, from, a, most, noble, and, laudable, temper, of, the, mind, and, tends, to, a, very, good, purpose, whereas, the, contrary, temper, is, odious, to, the, gods, and, unbeneficial, in, itself, for, they, who, break, into, extravagant, praises, of, human, nature, and, the, arts, in, vogue, and, who, lay, themselves, out, in, admiring, the, things, they, already, possess, and, will, needs, have, the, sciences, cultivated, among, them, to, be, thought, absolutely, perfect, and, complete, in, the, first, place, show, little, regard, to, the, divine, nature, whilst, they, extol, their, own, inventions, almost, as, high, as, his, perfection, in, the, next, place, men, of, this, temper, are, unserviceable, and, prejudicial, in, life, whilst, they, imagine, themselves, already, got, to, the, top, of, things, and, there, rest, without, further, inquiry, on, the, contrary, they, who, arraign, and, accuse, both, nature, and, art, and, are, always, full, of, complaints, against, them, not, only, preserve, a, more, just, and, modest, sense, of, mind, but, are, also, perpetually, stirred, up, to, fresh, industry, and, new, discoveries, is, not, then, the, ignorance, and, fatality, of, mankind, to, be, extremely, pitied, whilst, they, remain, slaves, to, the, arrogance, of, a, few, of, their, own, fellows, and, are, dotingly, fond, of, that, scrap, of, grecian, knowledge, the, peripatetic, philosophy, and, this, to, such, a, degree, as, not, only, to, think, all, accusation, or, arraignment, thereof, useless, but, even, hold, it, suspect, and, dangerous, certainly, the, procedure, of, empedocles, though, furious—but, especially, that, of, democritus, (who, with, great, modesty, complained, that, all, things, were, abstruse, that, we, know, nothing, that, truth, lies, hid, in, deep, pits, that, falsehood, is, strangely, joined, and, twisted, along, with, truth, &c, )—is, to, be, preferred, before, the, confident, assuming, and, dogmatical, school, of, aristotle, mankind, are, therefore, to, be, admonished, that, the, arraignment, of, nature, and, of, art, is, pleasing, to, the, gods, and, that, a, sharp, and, vehement, accusation, of, prometheus, though, a, creator, a, founder, and, a, master, obtained, new, blessings, and, presents, from, the, divine, bounty, and, proved, more, sound, and, serviceable, than, a, diffusive, harangue, of, praise, and, gratulation, and, let, men, be, assured, that, the, fond, opinion, that, they, have, already, acquired, enough, is, a, principal, reason, why, they, have, acquired, so, little, that, the, perpetual, flower, of, youth, should, be, the, present, which, mankind, received, as, a, reward, for, their, accusation, carries, this, moral, that, the, ancients, seem, not, to, have, despaired, of, discovering, methods, and, remedies, for, retarding, old, age, and, prolonging, the, period, of, human, life, but, rather, reckoned, it, among, those, things, which, through, sloth, and, want, of, diligent, inquiry, perish, and, come, to, nothing, after, having, been, once, undertaken, than, among, such, as, are, absolutely, impossible, or, placed, beyond, the, reach, of, the, human, power, for, they, signify, and, intimate, from, the, true, use, of, fire, and, the, just, and, strenuous, accusation, and, conviction, of, the, errors, of, art, that, the, divine, bounty, is, not, wanting, to, men, in, such, kind, of, presents, but, that, men, indeed, are, wanting, to, themselves, and, lay, such, an, inestimable, gift, upon, the, back, of, a, slow-paced, ass, that, is, upon, the, back, of, the, heavy, dull, lingering, thing, experience, from, whose, sluggish, and, tortoise-pace, proceeds, that, ancient, complaint, of, the, shortness, of, life, and, the, slow, advancement, of, arts, and, certainly, it, may, well, seem, that, the, two, faculties, of, reasoning, and, experience, are, not, hitherto, properly, joined, and, coupled, together, but, to, be, still, new, gifts, of, the, gods, separately, laid, the, one, upon, the, back, of, a, light, bird, or, abstract, philosophy, and, the, other, upon, an, ass, or, slow-paced, practice, and, trial, and, yet, good, hopes, might, be, conceived, of, this, ass, if, it, were, not, for, his, thirst, and, the, accidents, of, the, way, for, we, judge, that, if, any, one, would, constantly, proceed, by, a, certain, law, and, method, in, the, road, of, experience, and, not, by, the, way, thirst, after, such, experiments, as, make, for, profit, or, ostentation, nor, exchange, his, burden, or, quit, the, original, design, for, the, sake, of, these, he, might, be, an, useful, bearer, of, a, new, and, accumulated, divine, bounty, to, mankind, that, this, gift, of, perpetual, youth, should, pass, from, men, to, serpents, seems, added, by, way, of, ornament, and, illustration, to, the, fable, perhaps, intimating, at, the, same, time, the, shame, it, is, for, men, that, they, with, their, fire, and, numerous, arts, cannot, procure, to, themselves, those, things, which, nature, has, bestowed, upon, many, other, creatures, the, sudden, reconciliation, of, prometheus, to, mankind, after, being, disappointed, of, their, hopes, contains, a, prudent, and, useful, admonition, it, points, out, the, levity, and, temerity, of, men, in, new, experiments, when, not, presently, succeeding, or, answering, to, expectation, they, precipitantly, quit, their, new, undertakings, hurry, back, to, their, old, ones, and, grow, reconciled, thereto, after, the, fable, has, described, the, state, of, man, with, regard, to, arts, and, intellectual, matters, it, passes, on, to, religion, for, after, the, inventing, and, settling, of, arts, follows, the, establishment, of, divine, worship, which, hypocrisy, presently, enters, into, and, corrupts, so, that, by, the, two, sacrifices, we, have, elegantly, painted, the, person, of, a, man, truly, religious, and, of, an, hypocrite, one, of, these, sacrifices, contained, the, fat, or, the, portion, of, god, used, for, burning, and, incensing, thereby, denoting, affection, and, zeal, offered, up, to, his, glory, it, likewise, contained, the, bowels, which, are, expressive, of, charity, along, with, the, good, and, useful, flesh, but, the, other, contained, nothing, more, than, dry, bones, which, nevertheless, stuffed, out, the, hide, so, as, to, make, it, resemble, a, fair, beautiful, and, magnificent, sacrifice, hereby, finely, denoting, the, external, and, empty, rites, and, barren, ceremonies, wherewith, men, burden, and, stuff, out, the, divine, worship, —things, rather, intended, for, show, and, ostentation, than, conducing, to, piety, nor, are, mankind, simply, content, with, this, mock-worship, of, god, but, also, impose, and, further, it, upon, him, as, if, he, had, chosen, and, ordained, it, certainly, the, prophet, in, the, person, of, god, has, a, fine, expostulation, as, to, this, matter, of, choice, “is, this, the, fasting, which, have, chosen, that, a, man, should, afflict, his, soul, for, a, day, and, bow, down, his, head, like, a, bulrush, ”, after, thus, touching, the, state, of, religion, the, fable, next, turns, to, manners, and, the, conditions, of, human, life, and, though, it, be, a, very, common, yet, is, it, a, just, interpretation, that, pandora, denotes, the, pleasures, and, licentiousness, which, the, cultivation, and, luxury, of, the, arts, of, civil, life, introduce, as, it, were, by, the, instrumental, efficacy, of, fire, whence, the, works, of, the, voluptuary, arts, are, properly, attributed, to, vulcan, the, god, of, fire, and, hence, infinite, miseries, and, calamities, have, proceeded, to, the, minds, the, bodies, and, the, fortunes, of, men, together, with, a, late, repentance, and, this, not, in, each, man’s, particular, but, also, in, kingdoms, and, states, for, wars, and, tumults, and, tyrannies, have, all, arisen, from, this, same, fountain, or, box, of, pandora, it, is, worth, observing, how, beautifully, and, elegantly, the, fable, has, drawn, two, reigning, characters, in, human, life, and, given, two, examples, or, tablatures, of, them, under, the, persons, of, prometheus, and, epimetheus, the, followers, of, epimetheus, are, improvident, see, not, far, before, them, and, prefer, such, things, as, are, agreeable, for, the, present, whence, they, are, oppressed, with, numerous, straits, difficulties, and, calamities, with, which, they, almost, continually, struggle, but, in, the, mean, time, gratify, their, own, temper, and, for, want, of, a, better, knowledge, of, things, feed, their, minds, with, many, vain, hopes, and, as, with, so, many, pleasing, dreams, delight, themselves, and, sweeten, the, miseries, of, life, but, the, followers, of, prometheus, are, the, prudent, wary, men, that, look, into, futurity, and, cautiously, guard, against, prevent, and, undermine, many, calamities, and, misfortunes, but, this, watchful, provident, temper, is, attended, with, a, deprivation, of, numerous, pleasures, and, the, loss, of, various, delights, whilst, such, men, debar, themselves, the, use, even, of, innocent, things, and, what, is, still, worse, rack, and, torture, themselves, with, cares, fears, and, disquiets, being, bound, fast, to, the, pillar, of, necessity, and, tormented, with, numberless, thoughts, (which, for, their, swiftness, are, well, compared, to, an, eagle), that, continually, wound, tear, and, gnaw, their, liver, or, mind, unless, perhaps, they, find, some, small, remission, by, intervals, or, as, it, were, at, nights, but, then, new, anxieties, dreads, and, fears, soon, return, again, as, it, were, in, the, morning, and, therefore, very, few, men, of, either, temper, have, secured, to, themselves, the, advantages, of, providence, and, kept, clear, of, disquiets, troubles, and, misfortunes, nor, indeed, can, any, man, obtain, this, end, without, the, assistance, of, hercules, that, is, of, such, fortitude, and, constancy, of, mind, as, stands, prepared, against, every, event, and, remains, indifferent, to, every, change, looking, forward, without, being, daunted, enjoying, the, good, without, disdain, and, enduring, the, bad, without, impatience, and, it, must, be, observed, that, even, prometheus, had, not, the, power, to, free, himself, but, owed, his, deliverance, to, another, for, no, natural, inbred, force, and, fortitude, could, prove, equal, to, such, a, task, the, power, of, releasing, him, came, from, the, utmost, confines, of, the, ocean, and, from, the, sun, that, is, from, apollo, or, knowledge, and, again, from, a, due, consideration, of, the, uncertainty, instability, and, fluctuating, state, of, human, life, which, is, aptly, represented, by, sailing, the, ocean, accordingly, virgil, has, prudently, joined, these, two, together, accounting, him, happy, who, knows, the, causes, of, things, and, has, conquered, all, his, fears, apprehensions, and, superstitions, [642], it, is, added, with, great, elegance, for, supporting, and, confirming, the, human, mind, that, the, great, hero, who, thus, delivered, him, sailed, the, ocean, in, a, cup, or, pitcher, to, prevent, fear, or, complaint, as, if, through, the, narrowness, of, our, nature, or, a, too, great, fragility, thereof, we, were, absolutely, incapable, of, that, fortitude, and, constancy, to, which, seneca, finely, alludes, when, he, says, “it, is, a, noble, thing, at, once, to, participate, in, the, frailty, of, man, and, the, security, of, a, god, ”, we, have, hitherto, that, we, might, not, break, the, connection, of, things, designedly, omitted, the, last, crime, of, prometheus—that, of, attempting, the, chastity, of, minerva—which, heinous, offence, it, doubtless, was, that, caused, the, punishment, of, having, his, liver, gnawed, by, the, vulture, the, meaning, seems, to, be, this, —that, when, men, are, puffed, up, with, arts, and, knowledge, they, often, try, to, subdue, even, the, divine, wisdom, and, bring, it, under, the, dominion, of, sense, and, reason, whence, inevitably, follows, a, perpetual, and, restless, rending, and, tearing, of, the, mind, sober, and, humble, distinction, must, therefore, be, made, betwixt, divine, and, human, things, and, betwixt, the, oracles, of, sense, and, faith, unless, mankind, had, rather, choose, an, heretical, religion, and, a, fictitious, and, romantic, philosophy, [643], the, last, particular, in, the, fable, is, the, games, of, the, torch, instituted, to, prometheus, which, again, relates, to, arts, and, sciences, as, well, as, the, invention, of, fire, for, the, commemoration, and, celebration, whereof, these, games, were, held, and, here, we, have, an, extremely, prudent, admonition, directing, us, to, expect, the, perfection, of, the, sciences, from, succession, and, not, from, the, swiftness, and, abilities, of, any, single, person, for, he, who, is, fleetest, and, strongest, in, the, course, may, perhaps, be, less, fit, to, keep, his, torch, alight, since, there, is, danger, of, its, going, out, from, too, rapid, as, well, as, from, too, slow, a, motion, [644], but, this, kind, of, contest, with, the, torch, seems, to, have, been, long, dropped, and, neglected, the, sciences, appearing, to, have, flourished, principally, in, their, first, authors, as, aristotle, galen, euclid, ptolemy, &c, whilst, their, successors, have, done, very, little, or, scarce, made, any, attempts, but, it, were, highly, to, be, wished, that, these, games, might, be, renewed, to, the, honor, of, prometheus, or, human, nature, and, that, they, might, excite, contest, emulation, and, laudable, endeavors, and, the, design, meet, with, such, success, as, not, to, hang, tottering, tremulous, and, hazarded, upon, the, torch, of, any, single, person, mankind, therefore, should, be, admonished, to, rouse, themselves, and, try, and, exert, their, own, strength, and, chance, and, not, place, all, their, dependence, upon, a, few, men, whose, abilities, and, capacities, perhaps, are, not, greater, than, their, own, these, are, the, particulars, which, appear, to, us, shadowed, out, by, this, trite, and, vulgar, fable, though, without, denying, that, there, may, be, contained, in, it, several, intimations, that, have, a, surprising, correspondence, with, the, christian, mysteries, in, particular, the, voyage, of, hercules, made, in, a, pitcher, to, release, prometheus, bears, an, allusion, to, the, word, of, god, coming, in, the, frail, vessel, of, the, flesh, to, redeem, mankind, but, we, indulge, ourselves, no, such, liberties, as, these, for, fear, of, using, strange, fire, at, the, altar, of, the, lord, mediocrity, or, the, holding, a, middle, course, has, been, highly, extolled, in, morality, but, little, in, matters, of, science, though, no, less, useful, and, proper, here, whilst, in, politics, it, is, held, suspected, and, ought, to, be, employed, with, judgment, the, ancients, described, mediocrity, in, manners, by, the, course, prescribed, to, icarus, and, in, matters, of, the, understanding, by, the, steering, betwixt, scylla, and, charybdis, on, account, of, the, great, difficulty, and, danger, in, passing, those, straits, icarus, being, to, fly, across, the, sea, was, ordered, by, his, father, neither, to, soar, too, high, nor, fly, too, low, for, as, his, wings, were, fastened, together, with, wax, there, was, danger, of, its, melting, by, the, sun’s, heat, in, too, high, a, flight, and, of, its, becoming, less, tenacious, by, the, moisture, if, he, kept, too, near, the, vapor, of, the, sea, but, he, with, a, juvenile, confidence, soared, aloft, and, fell, down, headlong, —the, fable, is, vulgar, and, easily, interpreted, for, the, path, of, virtue, lies, straight, between, excess, on, the, one, side, and, defect, on, the, other, and, no, wonder, that, excess, should, prove, the, bane, of, icarus, exulting, in, juvenile, strength, and, vigor, for, excess, is, the, natural, vice, of, youth, as, defect, is, that, of, old, age, and, if, a, man, must, perish, by, either, icarus, chose, the, better, of, the, two, for, all, defects, are, justly, esteemed, more, depraved, than, excesses, there, is, some, magnanimity, in, excess, that, like, a, bird, claims, kindred, with, the, heavens, but, defect, is, a, reptile, that, basely, crawls, upon, the, earth, it, was, excellently, said, by, heraclitus, dry, light, makes, the, best, soul, ”, for, if, the, soul, contracts, moisture, from, the, earth, it, perfectly, degenerates, and, sinks, on, the, other, hand, moderation, must, be, observed, to, prevent, this, fine, light, from, burning, by, its, too, great, subtility, and, dryness, but, these, observations, are, common, in, matters, of, the, understanding, it, requires, great, skill, and, a, particular, felicity, to, steer, clear, of, scylla, and, charybdis, if, the, ship, strikes, upon, scylla, it, is, dashed, in, pieces, against, the, rocks, if, upon, charybdis, it, is, swallowed, outright, this, allegory, is, pregnant, with, matter, but, we, shall, only, observe, the, force, of, it, lies, here, that, a, mean, be, observed, in, every, doctrine, and, science, and, in, the, rules, and, axioms, thereof, between, the, rocks, of, distinctions, and, the, whirlpools, of, universalities, for, these, two, are, the, bane, and, shipwreck, of, fine, geniuses, and, arts, they, relate, that, sphinx, was, a, monster, variously, formed, having, the, face, and, voice, of, a, virgin, the, wings, of, a, bird, and, the, talons, of, a, griffin, she, resided, on, the, top, of, a, mountain, near, the, city, thebes, and, also, beset, the, highways, her, manner, was, to, lie, in, ambush, and, seize, the, travellers, and, having, them, in, her, power, to, propose, to, them, certain, dark, and, perplexed, riddles, which, it, was, thought, she, received, from, the, muses, and, if, her, wretched, captives, could, not, solve, and, interpret, these, riddles, she, with, great, cruelty, fell, upon, them, in, their, hesitation, and, confusion, and, tore, them, to, pieces, this, plague, having, reigned, a, long, time, the, thebans, at, length, offered, their, kingdom, to, the, man, who, could, interpret, her, riddles, there, being, no, other, way, to, subdue, her, œdipus, a, penetrating, and, prudent, man, though, lame, in, his, feet, excited, by, so, great, a, reward, accepted, the, condition, and, with, a, good, assurance, of, mind, cheerfully, presented, himself, before, the, monster, who, directly, asked, him, “what, creature, that, was, which, being, born, four-footed, afterwards, became, two-footed, then, three-footed, and, lastly, four-footed, again, ”, œdipus, with, presence, of, mind, replied, it, was, man, who, upon, his, first, birth, and, infant, state, crawled, upon, all, fours, in, endeavoring, to, walk, but, not, long, after, went, upright, upon, his, two, natural, feet, again, in, old, age, walked, three-footed, with, a, stick, and, at, last, growing, decrepit, lay, four-footed, confined, to, his, bed, and, having, by, this, exact, solution, obtained, the, victory, he, slew, the, monster, and, laying, the, carcass, upon, an, ass, led, her, away, in, triumph, and, upon, this, he, was, according, to, the, agreement, made, king, of, thebes, —this, is, an, elegant, instructive, fable, and, seems, invented, to, represent, science, especially, as, joined, with, practice, for, science, may, without, absurdity, be, called, a, monster, being, strangely, gazed, at, and, admired, by, the, ignorant, and, unskilful, her, figure, and, form, is, various, by, reason, of, the, vast, variety, of, subjects, that, science, considers, her, voice, and, countenance, are, represented, female, by, reason, of, her, gay, appearance, and, volubility, of, speech, wings, are, added, because, the, sciences, and, their, inventions, run, and, fly, about, in, a, moment, for, knowledge, like, light, communicated, from, one, torch, to, another, is, presently, caught, and, copiously, diffused, sharp, and, hooked, talons, are, elegantly, attributed, to, her, because, the, axioms, and, arguments, of, science, enter, the, mind, lay, hold, of, it, fix, it, down, and, keep, it, from, moving, or, slipping, away, this, the, sacred, philosopher, observed, when, he, said, “the, words, of, the, wise, are, like, goads, or, nails, driven, far, in, ”[645], again, all, science, seems, placed, on, high, as, it, were, on, the, tops, of, mountains, that, are, hard, to, climb, for, science, is, justly, imagined, a, sublime, and, lofty, thing, looking, down, upon, ignorance, from, an, eminence, and, at, the, same, time, taking, an, extensive, view, on, all, sides, as, is, usual, on, the, tops, of, mountains, science, is, said, to, beset, the, highways, because, through, all, the, journey, and, peregrination, of, human, life, there, is, matter, and, occasion, offered, of, contemplation, sphinx, is, said, to, propose, various, difficult, questions, and, riddles, to, men, which, she, received, from, the, muses, and, these, questions, so, long, as, they, remain, with, the, muses, may, very, well, be, unaccompanied, with, severity, for, while, there, is, no, other, end, of, contemplation, and, inquiry, but, that, of, knowledge, alone, the, understanding, is, not, oppressed, or, driven, to, straits, and, difficulties, but, expatiates, and, ranges, at, large, and, even, receives, a, degree, of, pleasure, from, doubt, and, variety, but, after, the, muses, have, given, over, their, riddles, to, sphinx, that, is, to, practice, which, urges, and, impels, to, action, choice, and, determination, then, it, is, that, they, become, torturing, severe, and, trying, and, unless, solved, and, interpreted, strangely, perplex, and, harass, the, human, mind, rend, it, every, way, and, perfectly, tear, it, to, pieces, all, the, riddles, of, sphinx, therefore, have, two, conditions, annexed, viz, dilaceration, to, those, who, do, not, solve, them, and, empire, to, those, that, do, for, he, who, understands, the, thing, proposed, obtains, his, end, and, every, artificer, rules, over, his, work, [646], sphinx, has, no, more, than, two, kinds, of, riddles, one, relating, to, the, nature, of, things, the, other, to, the, nature, of, man, and, correspondent, to, these, the, prizes, of, the, solution, are, two, kinds, of, empire, —the, empire, over, nature, and, the, empire, over, man, for, the, true, and, ultimate, end, of, natural, philosophy, is, dominion, over, natural, things, natural, bodies, remedies, machines, and, numberless, other, particulars, though, the, schools, contented, with, what, spontaneously, offers, and, swollen, with, their, own, discourses, neglect, and, in, a, manner, despise, both, things, and, works, but, the, riddle, proposed, to, œdipus, the, solution, whereof, acquired, him, the, theban, kingdom, regarded, the, nature, of, man, for, he, who, has, thoroughly, looked, into, and, examined, human, nature, may, in, a, manner, command, his, own, fortune, and, seems, born, to, acquire, dominion, and, rule, accordingly, virgil, properly, makes, the, arts, of, government, to, be, the, arts, of, the, romans, [647], it, was, therefore, extremely, apposite, in, augustus, cæsar, to, use, the, image, of, sphinx, in, his, signet, whether, this, happened, by, accident, or, by, design, for, he, of, all, men, was, deeply, versed, in, politics, and, through, the, course, of, his, life, very, happily, solved, abundance, of, new, riddles, with, regard, to, the, nature, of, man, and, unless, he, had, done, this, with, great, dexterity, and, ready, address, he, would, frequently, have, been, involved, in, imminent, danger, if, not, destruction, it, is, with, the, utmost, elegance, added, in, the, fable, that, when, sphinx, was, conquered, her, carcass, was, laid, upon, an, ass, for, there, is, nothing, so, subtile, and, abstruse, but, after, being, once, made, plain, intelligible, and, common, it, may, be, received, by, the, slowest, capacity, we, must, not, omit, that, sphinx, was, conquered, by, a, lame, man, and, impotent, in, his, feet, for, men, usually, make, too, much, haste, to, the, solution, of, sphinx’s, riddles, whence, it, happens, that, she, prevailing, their, minds, are, rather, racked, and, torn, by, disputes, than, invested, with, command, by, works, and, effects, they, tell, us, pluto, having, upon, that, memorable, division, of, empire, among, the, gods, received, the, infernal, regions, for, his, share, despaired, of, winning, any, one, of, the, goddesses, in, marriage, by, an, obsequious, courtship, and, therefore, through, necessity, resolved, upon, a, rape, having, watched, his, opportunity, he, suddenly, seized, upon, proserpine, a, most, beautiful, virgin, the, daughter, of, ceres, as, she, was, gathering, narcissus, flowers, in, the, meads, of, sicily, and, hurrying, her, to, his, chariot, carried, her, with, him, to, the, subterraneal, regions, where, she, was, treated, with, the, highest, reverence, and, styled, the, lady, of, dis, but, ceres, missing, her, only, daughter, whom, she, extremely, loved, grew, pensive, and, anxious, beyond, measure, and, taking, a, lighted, torch, in, her, hand, wandered, the, world, over, in, quest, of, her, daughter, —but, all, to, no, purpose, till, suspecting, she, might, be, carried, to, the, infernal, regions, she, with, great, lamentation, and, abundance, of, tears, importuned, jupiter, to, restore, her, and, with, much, ado, prevailed, so, far, as, to, recover, and, bring, her, away, if, she, had, tasted, nothing, there, this, proved, a, hard, condition, upon, the, mother, for, proserpine, was, found, to, have, eaten, three, kernels, of, a, pomegranate, ceres, however, desisted, not, but, fell, to, her, entreaties, and, lamentations, afresh, insomuch, that, at, last, it, was, indulged, her, that, proserpine, should, divide, the, year, betwixt, her, husband, and, her, mother, and, live, six, months, with, the, one, and, as, many, with, the, other, after, this, theseus, and, perithous, with, uncommon, audacity, attempted, to, force, proserpine, away, from, pluto’s, bed, but, happening, to, grow, tired, in, their, journey, and, resting, themselves, upon, a, stone, in, the, realms, below, they, could, never, rise, from, it, again, but, remain, sitting, there, forever, proserpine, therefore, still, continued, queen, of, the, lower, regions, in, honor, of, whom, there, was, also, added, this, grand, privilege, that, though, it, had, never, been, permitted, any, one, to, return, after, having, once, descended, thither, a, particular, exception, was, made, that, he, who, brought, a, golden, bough, as, a, present, to, proserpine, might, on, that, condition, descend, and, return, this, was, an, only, bough, that, grew, in, a, large, dark, grove, not, from, a, tree, of, its, own, but, like, the, mistletoe, from, another, and, when, plucked, away, a, fresh, one, always, shot, out, in, its, stead, —this, fable, seems, to, regard, natural, philosophy, and, searches, deep, into, that, rich, and, fruitful, virtue, and, supply, in, subterraneous, bodies, from, whence, all, the, things, upon, the, earth’s, surface, spring, and, into, which, they, again, relapse, and, return, by, proserpine, the, ancients, denoted, that, ethereal, spirit, shut, up, and, detained, within, the, earth, here, represented, by, pluto, —the, spirit, being, separated, from, the, superior, globe, according, to, the, expression, of, the, poet, [648], this, spirit, is, conceived, as, ravished, or, snatched, up, by, the, earth, because, it, can, in, no, way, be, detained, when, it, has, time, and, opportunity, to, fly, off, but, is, only, wrought, together, and, fixed, by, sudden, intermixture, and, comminution, in, the, same, manner, as, if, one, should, endeavor, to, mix, air, with, water, which, cannot, otherwise, be, done, than, by, a, quick, and, rapid, agitation, that, joins, them, together, in, froth, whilst, the, air, is, thus, caught, up, by, the, water, and, it, is, elegantly, added, that, proserpine, was, ravished, whilst, she, gathered, narcissus, flowers, which, have, their, name, from, numbedness, or, stupefaction, for, the, spirit, we, speak, of, is, in, the, fittest, disposition, to, be, embraced, by, terrestrial, matter, when, it, begins, to, coagulate, or, grow, torpid, as, it, were, it, is, an, honor, justly, attributed, to, proserpine, and, not, to, any, other, wife, of, the, gods, that, of, being, the, lady, or, mistress, of, her, husband, because, this, spirit, performs, all, its, operations, in, the, subterraneal, regions, whilst, pluto, or, the, earth, remains, stupid, or, as, it, were, ignorant, of, them, the, ether, or, the, efficacy, of, the, heavenly, bodies, denoted, by, ceres, endeavors, with, infinite, diligence, to, force, out, this, spirit, and, restore, it, to, its, pristine, state, and, by, the, torch, in, the, hand, of, ceres, or, the, ether, is, doubtless, meant, the, sun, which, disperses, light, over, the, whole, globe, of, the, earth, and, if, the, thing, were, possible, must, have, the, greatest, share, in, recovering, proserpine, or, reinstating, the, subterraneal, spirit, yet, proserpine, still, continues, and, dwells, below, after, the, manner, excellently, described, in, the, condition, betwixt, jupiter, and, ceres, for, first, it, is, certain, that, there, are, two, ways, of, detaining, the, spirit, in, solid, and, terrestrial, matter, —the, one, by, condensation, or, obstruction, which, is, mere, violence, and, imprisonment, the, other, by, administering, a, proper, aliment, which, is, spontaneous, and, free, for, after, the, included, spirit, begins, to, feed, and, nourish, itself, it, is, not, in, a, hurry, to, fly, off, but, remains, as, it, were, fixed, in, its, own, earth, and, this, is, the, moral, of, proserpine’s, tasting, the, pomegranate, and, were, it, not, for, this, she, must, long, ago, have, been, carried, up, by, ceres, who, with, her, torch, wandered, the, world, over, and, so, the, earth, have, been, left, without, its, spirit, for, though, the, spirit, in, metals, and, minerals, may, perhaps, be, after, a, particular, manner, wrought, in, by, the, solidity, of, the, mass, yet, the, spirit, of, vegetables, and, animals, has, open, passages, to, escape, at, unless, it, be, willingly, detained, in, the, way, of, sipping, and, tasting, them, the, second, article, of, agreement, that, of, proserpine’s, remaining, six, months, with, her, mother, and, six, with, her, husband, is, an, elegant, description, of, the, division, of, the, year, for, the, spirit, diffused, through, the, earth, lives, above-ground, in, the, vegetable, world, during, the, summer, months, but, in, the, winter, returns, under, ground, again, the, attempt, of, theseus, and, perithous, to, bring, proserpine, away, denotes, that, the, more, subtile, spirits, which, descend, in, many, bodies, to, the, earth, may, frequently, be, unable, to, drink, in, unite, with, themselves, and, carry, off, the, subterraneous, spirit, but, on, the, contrary, be, coagulated, by, it, and, rise, no, more, so, as, to, increase, the, inhabitants, and, add, to, the, dominion, of, proserpine, [649], the, alchemists, will, be, apt, to, fall, in, with, our, interpretation, of, the, golden, bough, whether, we, will, or, no, because, they, promise, golden, mountains, and, the, restoration, of, natural, bodies, from, their, stone, as, from, the, gates, of, pluto, but, we, are, well, assured, that, their, theory, had, no, just, foundation, and, suspect, they, have, no, very, encouraging, or, practical, proofs, of, its, soundness, leaving, therefore, their, conceits, to, themselves, we, shall, freely, declare, our, own, sentiments, upon, this, last, part, of, the, fable, we, are, certain, from, numerous, figures, and, expressions, of, the, ancients, that, they, judged, the, conservation, and, in, some, degree, the, renovation, of, natural, bodies, to, be, no, desperate, or, impossible, thing, but, rather, abstruse, and, out, of, the, common, road, than, wholly, impracticable, and, this, seems, to, be, their, opinion, in, the, present, case, as, they, have, placed, this, bough, among, an, infinite, number, of, shrubs, in, a, spacious, and, thick, wood, they, supposed, it, of, gold, because, gold, is, the, emblem, of, duration, they, feigned, it, adventitious, not, native, because, such, an, effect, is, to, be, expected, from, art, and, not, from, any, medicine, or, any, simple, or, mere, natural, way, of, working, the, ancient, poets, relate, that, jupiter, took, metis, to, wife, whose, name, plainly, denotes, counsel, and, that, he, perceiving, she, was, pregnant, by, him, would, by, no, means, wait, the, time, of, her, delivery, but, directly, devoured, her, whence, himself, also, became, pregnant, and, was, delivered, in, a, wonderful, manner, for, he, from, his, head, or, brain, brought, forth, pallas, armed, —this, fable, which, in, its, literal, sense, appears, monstrously, absurd, seems, to, contain, a, state, secret, and, shows, with, what, art, kings, usually, carry, themselves, towards, their, council, in, order, to, preserve, their, own, authority, and, majesty, not, only, inviolate, but, so, as, to, have, it, magnified, and, heightened, among, the, people, for, kings, commonly, link, themselves, as, it, were, in, a, nuptial, bond, to, their, council, and, deliberate, and, communicate, with, them, after, a, prudent, and, laudable, custom, upon, matters, of, the, greatest, importance, at, the, same, time, justly, conceiving, this, no, diminution, of, their, majesty, but, when, the, matter, once, ripens, to, a, decree, or, order, which, is, a, kind, of, birth, the, king, then, suffers, the, council, to, go, on, no, further, lest, the, act, should, seem, to, depend, upon, their, pleasure, now, therefore, the, king, usually, assumes, to, himself, whatever, was, wrought, elaborated, or, formed, as, it, were, in, the, womb, of, the, council, (unless, it, be, a, matter, of, an, invidious, nature, which, he, is, sure, to, put, from, him), so, that, the, decree, and, the, execution, shall, seem, to, flow, from, himself, [650], and, as, this, decree, or, execution, proceeds, with, prudence, and, power, so, as, to, imply, necessity, it, is, elegantly, wrapped, up, under, the, figure, of, pallas, armed, nor, are, kings, content, to, have, this, seem, the, effect, of, their, own, authority, free, will, and, uncontrollable, choice, unless, they, also, take, the, whole, honor, to, themselves, and, make, the, people, imagine, that, all, good, and, wholesome, decrees, proceed, entirely, from, their, own, head, that, is, their, own, sole, prudence, and, judgment, —the, fable, of, the, sirens, is, in, a, vulgar, sense, justly, enough, explained, of, the, pernicious, incentives, to, pleasure, but, the, ancient, mythology, seems, to, us, like, a, vintage, ill-pressed, and, trod, for, though, something, has, been, drawn, from, it, yet, all, the, more, excellent, parts, remain, behind, in, the, grapes, that, are, untouched, —the, sirens, are, said, to, be, the, daughters, of, achelous, and, terpsichore, one, of, the, muses, in, their, early, days, they, had, wings, but, lost, them, upon, being, conquered, by, the, muses, with, whom, they, rashly, contended, and, with, the, feathers, of, these, wings, the, muses, made, themselves, crowns, so, that, from, this, time, the, muses, wore, wings, on, their, heads, except, only, the, mother, to, the, sirens, these, sirens, resided, in, certain, pleasant, islands, and, when, from, their, watch-tower, they, saw, any, ship, approaching, they, first, detained, the, sailors, by, their, music, then, enticing, them, to, shore, destroyed, them, their, singing, was, not, of, one, and, the, same, kind, but, they, adapted, their, tunes, exactly, to, the, nature, of, each, person, in, order, to, captivate, and, secure, him, and, so, destructive, had, they, been, that, these, islands, of, the, sirens, appeared, to, a, very, great, distance, white, with, the, bones, of, their, unburied, captives, two, different, remedies, were, invented, to, protect, persons, against, them, the, one, by, ulysses, the, other, by, orpheus, ulysses, commanded, his, associates, to, stop, their, ears, close, with, wax, and, he, determining, to, make, the, trial, and, yet, avoid, the, danger, ordered, himself, to, be, tied, fast, to, a, mast, of, the, ship, giving, strict, charge, not, to, be, unbound, even, though, himself, should, entreat, it, but, orpheus, without, any, binding, at, all, escaped, the, danger, by, loudly, chanting, to, his, harp, the, praises, of, the, gods, whereby, he, drowned, the, voices, of, the, sirens, —this, fable, is, of, the, moral, kind, and, appears, no, less, elegant, than, easy, to, interpret, for, pleasures, proceed, from, plenty, and, affluence, attended, with, activity, or, exultation, of, the, mind, [651], anciently, their, first, incentives, were, quick, and, seized, upon, men, as, if, they, had, been, winged, but, learning, and, philosophy, afterwards, prevailing, had, at, least, the, power, to, lay, the, mind, under, some, restraint, and, make, it, consider, the, issue, of, things, and, thus, deprived, pleasures, of, their, wings, this, conquest, redounded, greatly, to, the, honor, and, ornament, of, the, muses, for, after, it, appeared, by, the, example, of, a, few, that, philosophy, could, introduce, a, contempt, of, pleasures, it, immediately, seemed, to, be, a, sublime, thing, that, could, raise, and, elevate, the, soul, fixed, in, a, manner, down, to, the, earth, and, thus, render, men’s, thoughts, which, reside, in, the, head, winged, as, it, were, or, sublime, only, the, mother, of, the, sirens, was, not, thus, plumed, on, the, head, which, doubtless, denotes, superficial, learning, invented, and, used, for, delight, and, levity, an, eminent, example, whereof, we, have, in, petronius, who, after, receiving, sentence, of, death, still, continued, his, gay, frothy, humor, and, as, tacitus, observes, used, his, learning, to, solace, or, divert, himself, and, instead, of, such, discourses, as, give, firmness, and, constancy, of, mind, read, nothing, but, loose, poems, and, verses, [652], such, learning, as, this, seems, to, pluck, the, crowns, again, from, the, muses’, heads, and, restore, them, to, the, sirens, the, sirens, are, said, to, inhabit, certain, islands, because, pleasures, generally, seek, retirement, and, often, shun, society, and, for, their, songs, with, the, manifold, artifice, and, destructiveness, thereof, this, is, too, obvious, and, common, to, need, explanation, but, that, particular, of, the, bones, stretching, like, white, cliffs, along, the, shores, and, appearing, afar, off, contains, a, more, subtile, allegory, and, denotes, that, the, examples, of, others’, calamity, and, misfortunes, though, ever, so, manifest, and, apparent, have, yet, but, little, force, to, deter, the, corrupt, nature, of, man, from, pleasures, the, allegory, of, the, remedies, against, the, sirens, is, not, difficult, but, very, wise, and, noble, it, proposes, in, effect, three, remedies, as, well, against, subtile, as, violent, mischiefs, two, drawn, from, philosophy, and, one, from, religion, the, first, means, of, escaping, is, to, resist, the, earliest, temptation, in, the, beginning, and, diligently, avoid, and, cut, off, all, occasions, that, may, solicit, or, sway, the, mind, and, this, is, well, represented, by, shutting, up, the, ears, a, kind, of, remedy, to, be, necessarily, used, with, mean, and, vulgar, minds, such, as, the, retinue, of, ulysses, but, nobler, spirits, may, converse, even, in, the, midst, of, pleasures, if, the, mind, be, well, guarded, with, constancy, and, resolution, and, thus, some, delight, to, make, a, severe, trial, of, their, own, virtue, and, thoroughly, acquaint, themselves, with, the, folly, and, madness, of, pleasures, without, complying, or, being, wholly, given, up, to, them, which, is, what, solomon, professes, of, himself, when, he, closes, the, account, of, all, the, numerous, pleasures, he, gave, a, loose, to, with, this, expression, “but, wisdom, still, continued, with, me, ”, such, heroes, in, virtue, may, therefore, remain, unmoved, by, the, greatest, incentives, to, pleasure, and, stop, themselves, on, the, very, precipice, of, danger, if, according, to, the, example, of, ulysses, they, turn, a, deaf, ear, to, pernicious, counsel, and, the, flatteries, of, their, friends, and, companions, which, have, the, greatest, power, to, shake, and, unsettle, the, mind, but, the, most, excellent, remedy, in, every, temptation, is, that, of, orpheus, who, by, loudly, chanting, and, resounding, the, praises, of, the, gods, confounded, the, voices, and, kept, himself, from, hearing, the, music, of, the, sirens, for, divine, contemplations, exceed, the, pleasures, of, sense, not, only, in, power, but, also, in, sweetness, ﻿we, sailed, from, peru, (where, we, had, continued, for, the, space, of, one, whole, year), for, china, and, japan, by, the, south, sea, taking, with, us, victuals, for, twelve, months, and, had, good, winds, from, the, east, though, soft, and, weak, for, five, months, space, and, more, but, the, wind, came, about, and, settled, in, the, west, for, many, days, so, as, we, could, make, little, or, no, way, and, were, sometime, in, purpose, to, turn, back, but, then, again, there, arose, strong, and, great, winds, from, the, south, with, a, point, east, which, carried, us, up, (for, all, that, we, could, do), towards, the, north, by, which, time, our, victuals, failed, us, though, we, had, made, good, spare, of, them, so, that, finding, ourselves, in, the, midst, of, the, greatest, wilderness, of, waters, in, the, world, without, victuals, we, gave, ourselves, for, lost, men, and, prepared, for, death, yet, we, did, lift, up, our, hearts, and, voices, to, god, above, who, showeth, his, wonders, in, the, deep, beseeching, him, of, his, mercy, that, as, in, the, beginning, he, discovered, the, face, of, the, deep, and, brought, forth, dry, land, so, he, would, now, discover, land, to, us, that, we, might, not, perish, and, it, came, to, pass, that, the, next, day, about, evening, we, saw, within, a, kenning, before, us, towards, the, north, as, it, were, thick, clouds, which, did, put, us, in, some, hope, of, land, knowing, how, that, part, of, the, south, sea, was, utterly, unknown, and, might, have, islands, or, continents, that, hitherto, were, not, come, to, light, wherefore, we, bent, our, course, thither, where, we, saw, the, appearance, of, land, all, that, night, and, in, the, dawning, of, the, next, day, we, might, plainly, discern, that, it, was, a, land, flat, to, our, sight, and, full, of, boscage, which, made, it, show, the, more, dark, and, after, an, hour, and, a, half's, sailing, we, entered, into, a, good, haven, being, the, port, of, a, fair, city, not, great, indeed, but, well, built, and, that, gave, a, pleasant, view, from, the, sea, and, we, thinking, every, minute, long, till, we, were, on, land, came, close, to, the, shore, and, offered, to, land, but, straightways, we, saw, divers, of, the, people, with, bastons, in, their, hands, (as, it, were), forbidding, us, to, land, yet, without, any, cries, of, fierceness, but, only, as, warning, us, off, by, signs, that, they, made, whereupon, being, not, a, little, discomforted, we, were, advising, with, ourselves, what, we, should, do, during, which, time, there, made, forth, to, us, a, small, boat, with, about, eight, persons, in, it, whereof, one, of, them, had, in, his, hand, a, tipstaff, of, a, yellow, cane, tipped, at, both, ends, with, blue, who, came, aboard, our, ship, without, any, show, of, distrust, at, all, and, when, he, saw, one, of, our, number, present, himself, somewhat, before, the, rest, he, drew, forth, a, little, scroll, of, parchment, (somewhat, yellower, than, our, parchment, and, shining, like, the, leaves, of, writing, tables, but, otherwise, soft, and, flexible, ), and, delivered, it, to, our, foremost, man, in, which, scroll, were, written, in, ancient, hebrew, and, in, ancient, greek, and, in, good, latin, of, the, school, and, in, spanish, these, words, land, ye, not, none, of, you, and, provide, to, be, gone, from, this, coast, within, sixteen, days, except, you, have, further, time, given, you, meanwhile, if, you, want, fresh, water, or, victuals, or, help, for, your, sick, or, that, your, ship, needeth, repairs, write, down, your, wants, and, you, shall, have, that, which, belongeth, to, mercy, this, scroll, was, signed, with, a, stamp, of, cherubim, wings, not, spread, but, hanging, downwards, and, by, them, a, cross, this, being, delivered, the, officer, returned, and, left, only, a, servant, with, us, to, receive, our, answer, consulting, hereupon, amongst, ourselves, we, were, much, perplexed, the, denial, of, landing, and, hasty, warning, us, away, troubled, us, much, on, the, other, side, to, find, that, the, people, had, languages, and, were, so, full, of, humanity, did, comfort, us, not, a, little, and, above, all, the, sign, of, the, cross, to, that, instrument, was, to, us, a, great, rejoicing, and, as, it, were, a, certain, presage, of, good, our, answer, was, in, the, spanish, tongue, that, for, our, ship, it, was, well, for, we, had, rather, met, with, calms, and, contrary, winds, than, any, tempests, for, our, sick, they, were, many, and, in, very, ill, case, so, that, if, they, were, not, permitted, to, land, they, ran, danger, of, their, lives, our, other, wants, we, set, down, in, particular, adding, that, we, had, some, little, store, of, merchandise, which, if, it, pleased, them, to, deal, for, it, might, supply, our, wants, without, being, chargeable, unto, them, we, offered, some, reward, in, pistolets, unto, the, servant, and, a, piece, of, crimson, velvet, to, be, presented, to, the, officer, but, the, servant, took, them, not, nor, would, scarce, look, upon, them, and, so, left, us, and, went, back, in, another, little, boat, which, was, sent, for, him, about, three, hours, after, we, had, dispatched, our, answer, there, came, towards, us, a, person, (as, it, seemed), of, place, he, had, on, him, a, gown, with, wide, sleeves, of, a, kind, of, water, chamolet, of, an, excellent, azure, colour, fair, more, glossy, than, ours, his, under, apparel, was, green, and, so, was, his, hat, being, in, the, form, of, a, turban, daintily, made, and, not, so, huge, as, the, turkish, turbans, and, the, locks, of, his, hair, came, down, below, the, brims, of, it, reverend, man, was, he, to, behold, he, came, in, a, boat, gilt, in, some, part, of, it, with, four, persons, more, only, in, that, boat, and, was, followed, by, another, boat, wherein, were, some, twenty, when, he, was, come, within, a, flightshot, of, our, ship, signs, were, made, to, us, that, we, should, send, forth, some, to, meet, him, upon, the, water, which, we, presently, did, in, our, ship-boat, sending, the, principal, man, amongst, us, save, one, and, four, of, our, number, with, him, when, we, were, come, within, six, yards, of, their, boat, they, called, to, us, to, stay, and, not, to, approach, farther, which, we, did, and, thereupon, the, man, whom, before, described, stood, up, and, with, a, loud, voice, in, spanish, asked, are, ye, christians, we, answered, we, were, fearing, the, less, because, of, the, cross, we, had, seen, in, the, subscription, at, which, answer, the, said, person, lifted, up, his, right, hand, towards, heaven, and, drew, it, softly, to, his, mouth, (which, is, the, gesture, they, use, when, they, thank, god, ), and, then, said, if, ye, will, swear, (all, of, you), by, the, merits, of, the, saviour, that, ye, are, no, pirates, nor, have, shed, blood, lawfully, nor, unlawfully, within, forty, days, past, you, may, have, licence, to, come, on, land, we, said, we, were, all, ready, to, take, that, oath, whereupon, one, of, those, that, were, with, him, being, (as, it, seemed), a, notary, made, an, entry, of, this, act, which, done, another, of, the, attendants, of, the, great, person, which, was, with, him, in, the, same, boat, after, his, lord, had, spoken, a, little, to, him, said, aloud, my, lord, would, have, you, know, that, it, is, not, of, pride, or, greatness, that, he, cometh, not, aboard, your, ship, but, for, that, in, your, answer, you, declare, that, you, have, many, sick, amongst, you, he, was, warned, by, the, conservator, of, health, of, the, city, that, he, should, keep, a, distance, we, bowed, ourselves, towards, him, and, answered, we, were, his, humble, servants, and, accounted, for, great, honour, and, singular, humanity, towards, us, that, which, was, already, done, but, hoped, well, that, the, nature, of, the, sickness, of, our, men, was, not, infectious, so, he, returned, and, a, while, after, came, the, notary, to, us, aboard, our, ship, holding, in, his, hand, a, fruit, of, that, country, like, an, orange, but, of, color, between, orange-tawney, and, scarlet, which, cast, a, most, excellent, odour, he, used, it, (as, it, seemeth), for, a, preservative, against, infection, he, gave, us, our, oath, by, the, name, of, jesus, and, his, merits, and, after, told, us, that, the, next, day, by, six, of, the, clock, in, the, morning, we, should, be, sent, to, and, brought, to, the, strangers', house, (so, he, called, it, ), where, we, should, be, accommodated, of, things, both, for, our, whole, and, for, our, sick, so, he, left, us, and, when, we, offered, him, some, pistolets, he, smiling, said, he, must, not, be, twice, paid, for, one, labour, meaning, (as, take, it), that, he, had, salary, sufficient, of, the, state, for, his, service, for, (as, after, learned), they, call, an, officer, that, taketh, rewards, twice, paid, the, next, morning, early, there, came, to, us, the, same, officer, that, came, to, us, at, first, with, his, cane, and, told, us, he, came, to, conduct, us, to, the, strangers', house, and, that, he, had, prevented, the, hour, because, we, might, have, the, whole, day, before, us, for, our, business, for, said, he, if, you, will, follow, my, advice, there, shall, first, go, with, me, some, few, of, you, and, see, the, place, and, how, it, may, be, made, convenient, for, you, and, then, you, may, send, for, your, sick, and, the, rest, of, your, number, which, ye, will, bring, on, land, we, thanked, him, and, said, that, this, care, which, he, took, of, desolate, strangers, god, would, reward, and, so, six, of, us, went, on, land, with, him, and, when, we, were, on, land, he, went, before, us, and, turned, to, us, and, said, he, was, but, our, servant, and, our, guide, he, led, us, through, three, fair, streets, and, all, the, way, we, went, there, were, gathered, some, people, on, both, sides, standing, in, a, row, but, in, so, civil, a, fashion, as, if, it, had, been, not, to, wonder, at, us, but, to, welcome, us, and, divers, of, them, as, we, passed, by, them, put, their, arms, a, little, abroad, which, is, their, gesture, when, they, did, bid, any, welcome, the, strangers', house, is, a, fair, and, spacious, house, built, of, brick, of, somewhat, a, bluer, colour, than, our, brick, and, with, handsome, windows, some, of, glass, some, of, a, kind, of, cambric, oiled, he, brought, us, first, into, a, fair, parlour, above, stairs, and, then, asked, us, what, number, of, persons, we, were, and, how, many, sick, we, answered, we, were, in, all, (sick, and, whole, ), one, and, fifty, persons, whereof, our, sick, were, seventeen, he, desired, us, to, have, patience, a, little, and, to, stay, till, he, came, back, to, us, which, was, about, an, hour, after, and, then, he, led, us, to, see, the, chambers, which, were, provided, for, us, being, in, number, nineteen, they, having, cast, it, (as, it, seemeth), that, four, of, those, chambers, which, were, better, than, the, rest, might, receive, four, of, the, principal, men, of, our, company, and, lodge, them, alone, by, themselves, and, the, other, fifteen, chambers, were, to, lodge, us, two, and, two, together, the, chambers, were, handsome, and, cheerful, chambers, and, furnished, civilly, then, he, led, us, to, a, long, gallery, like, a, dorture, where, he, showed, us, all, along, the, one, side, (for, the, other, side, was, but, wall, and, window), seventeen, cells, very, neat, ones, having, partitions, of, cedar, wood, which, gallery, and, cells, being, in, all, forty, many, more, than, we, needed, were, instituted, as, an, infirmary, for, sick, persons, and, he, told, us, withal, that, as, any, of, our, sick, waxed, well, he, might, be, removed, from, his, cell, to, a, chamber, for, which, purpose, there, were, set, forth, ten, spare, chambers, besides, the, number, we, spake, of, before, this, done, he, brought, us, back, to, the, parlour, and, lifting, up, his, cane, a, little, (as, they, do, when, they, give, any, charge, or, command), said, to, us, ye, are, to, know, that, the, custom, of, the, land, requireth, that, after, this, day, and, to-morrow, (which, we, give, you, for, removing, of, your, people, from, your, ship, ), you, are, to, keep, within, doors, for, three, days, but, let, it, not, trouble, you, nor, do, not, think, yourselves, restrained, but, rather, left, to, your, rest, and, ease, you, shall, want, nothing, and, there, are, six, of, our, people, appointed, to, attend, you, for, any, business, you, may, have, abroad, we, gave, him, thanks, with, all, affection, and, respect, and, said, god, surely, is, manifested, in, this, land, we, offered, him, also, twenty, pistolets, but, he, smiled, and, only, said, what, twice, paid, and, so, he, left, us, soon, after, our, dinner, was, served, in, which, was, right, good, viands, both, for, bread, and, treat, better, than, any, collegiate, diet, that, have, known, in, europe, we, had, also, drink, of, three, sorts, all, wholesome, and, good, wine, of, the, grape, a, drink, of, grain, such, as, is, with, us, our, ale, but, more, clear, and, a, kind, of, cider, made, of, a, fruit, of, that, country, a, wonderful, pleasing, and, refreshing, drink, besides, there, were, brought, in, to, us, great, store, of, those, scarlet, oranges, for, our, sick, which, (they, said), were, an, assured, remedy, for, sickness, taken, at, sea, there, was, given, us, also, a, box, of, small, gray, or, whitish, pills, which, they, wished, our, sick, should, take, one, of, the, pills, every, night, before, sleep, which, (they, said), would, hasten, their, recovery, the, next, day, after, that, our, trouble, of, carriage, and, removing, of, our, men, and, goods, out, of, our, ship, was, somewhat, settled, and, quiet, thought, good, to, call, our, company, together, and, when, they, were, assembled, said, unto, them, my, dear, friends, let, us, know, ourselves, and, how, it, standeth, with, us, we, are, men, cast, on, land, as, jonas, was, out, of, the, whale's, belly, when, we, were, as, buried, in, the, deep, and, now, we, are, on, land, we, are, but, between, death, and, life, for, we, are, beyond, both, the, old, world, and, the, new, and, whether, ever, we, shall, see, europe, god, only, knoweth, it, is, a, kind, of, miracle, bath, brought, us, hither, and, it, must, be, little, less, that, shall, bring, us, hence, therefore, in, regard, of, our, deliverance, past, and, our, danger, present, and, to, come, let, us, look, up, to, god, and, every, man, reform, his, own, ways, besides, we, are, come, here, amongst, a, christian, people, full, of, piety, and, humanity, let, us, not, bring, that, confusion, of, face, upon, ourselves, as, to, show, our, vices, or, unworthiness, before, them, yet, there, is, more, for, they, have, by, commandment, (though, in, form, of, courtesy), cloistered, us, within, these, wall, for, three, days, who, knoweth, whether, it, be, not, to, take, some, taste, of, our, manners, and, conditions, and, if, they, find, them, bad, to, banish, us, straightways, if, good, to, give, us, further, time, for, these, men, that, they, have, given, us, for, attendance, may, withal, have, an, eye, upon, us, therefore, for, god's, love, and, as, we, love, the, weal, of, our, souls, and, bodies, let, us, so, behave, ourselves, as, we, may, be, at, peace, with, god, and, may, find, grace, in, the, eyes, of, this, people, our, company, with, one, voice, thanked, me, for, my, good, admonition, and, promised, me, to, live, soberly, and, civilly, and, without, giving, any, the, least, occasion, of, offence, so, we, spent, our, three, days, joyfully, and, without, care, in, expectation, what, would, be, done, with, us, when, they, were, expired, during, which, time, we, had, every, hour, joy, of, the, amendment, of, our, sick, who, thought, themselves, cast, into, some, divine, pool, of, healing, they, mended, so, kindly, and, so, fast, the, morrow, after, our, three, days, were, past, there, came, to, us, a, new, man, that, we, had, not, seen, before, clothed, in, blue, as, the, former, was, save, that, his, turban, was, white, with, a, small, red, cross, on, the, top, he, had, also, a, tippet, of, fine, linen, at, his, coming, in, he, did, bend, to, us, a, little, and, put, his, arms, abroad, we, of, our, parts, saluted, him, in, a, very, lowly, and, submissive, manner, as, looking, that, from, him, we, should, receive, sentence, of, life, or, death, he, desired, to, speak, with, some, few, of, us, whereupon, six, of, us, only, staid, and, the, rest, avoided, the, room, he, said, am, by, office, governor, of, this, house, of, strangers, and, by, vocation, am, a, christian, priest, and, therefore, am, come, to, you, to, offer, you, my, service, both, as, strangers, and, chiefly, as, christians, some, things, may, tell, you, which, think, you, will, not, be, unwilling, to, hear, the, state, hath, given, you, license, to, stay, on, land, for, the, space, of, six, weeks, and, let, it, not, trouble, you, if, your, occasions, ask, further, time, for, the, law, in, this, point, is, not, precise, and, do, not, doubt, but, my, self, shall, be, able, to, obtain, for, you, such, further, time, as, may, be, convenient, ye, shall, also, understand, that, the, strangers', house, is, at, this, time, rich, and, much, aforehand, for, it, hath, laid, up, revenue, these, thirty-seven, years, for, so, long, it, is, since, any, stranger, arrived, in, this, part, and, therefore, take, ye, no, care, the, state, will, defray, you, all, the, time, you, stay, neither, shall, you, stay, one, day, the, less, for, that, as, for, any, merchandise, ye, have, brought, ye, shall, be, well, used, and, have, your, return, either, in, merchandise, or, in, gold, and, silver, for, to, us, it, is, all, one, and, if, you, have, any, other, request, to, make, hide, it, not, for, ye, shall, find, we, will, not, make, your, countenance, to, fall, by, the, answer, ye, shall, receive, only, this, must, tell, you, that, none, of, you, must, go, above, a, karan, (that, is, with, them, a, mile, and, an, half), from, the, walls, of, the, city, without, especial, leave, we, answered, after, we, had, looked, awhile, one, upon, another, admiring, this, gracious, and, parent-like, usage, that, we, could, not, tell, what, to, say, for, we, wanted, words, to, express, our, thanks, and, his, noble, free, offers, left, us, nothing, to, ask, it, seemed, to, us, that, we, had, before, us, a, picture, of, our, salvation, in, heaven, for, we, that, were, a, while, since, in, the, jaws, of, death, were, now, brought, into, a, place, where, we, found, nothing, but, consolations, for, the, commandment, laid, upon, us, we, would, not, fail, to, obey, it, though, it, was, impossible, but, our, hearts, should, be, enflamed, to, tread, further, upon, this, happy, and, holy, ground, we, added, that, our, tongues, should, first, cleave, to, the, roofs, of, our, mouths, ere, we, should, forget, either, his, reverend, person, or, this, whole, nation, in, our, prayers, we, also, most, humbly, besought, him, to, accept, of, us, as, his, true, servants, by, as, just, a, right, as, ever, men, on, earth, were, bounden, laying, and, presenting, both, our, persons, and, all, we, had, at, his, feet, he, said, he, was, a, priest, and, looked, for, a, priest's, reward, which, was, our, brotherly, love, and, the, good, of, our, souls, and, bodies, so, he, went, from, us, not, without, tears, of, tenderness, in, his, eyes, and, left, us, also, confused, with, joy, and, kindness, saying, amongst, ourselves, that, we, were, come, into, a, land, of, angels, which, did, appear, to, us, daily, and, prevent, us, with, comforts, which, we, thought, not, of, much, less, expected, the, next, day, about, ten, of, the, clock, the, governor, came, to, us, again, and, after, salutations, said, familiarly, that, he, was, come, to, visit, us, and, called, for, a, chair, and, sat, him, down, and, we, being, some, ten, of, us, (the, rest, were, of, the, meaner, sort, or, else, gone, abroad, ), sat, down, with, him, and, when, we, were, set, he, began, thus, we, of, this, island, of, bensalem, (for, so, they, call, it, in, their, language, ), have, this, that, by, means, of, our, solitary, situation, and, of, the, laws, of, secrecy, which, we, have, for, our, travellers, and, our, rare, admission, of, strangers, we, know, well, most, part, of, the, habitable, world, and, are, ourselves, unknown, therefore, because, he, that, knoweth, least, is, fittest, to, ask, questions, it, is, more, reason, for, the, entertainment, of, the, time, that, ye, ask, me, questions, than, that, ask, you, we, answered, that, we, humbly, thanked, him, that, he, would, give, us, leave, so, to, do, and, that, we, conceived, by, the, taste, we, had, already, that, there, was, no, worldly, thing, on, earth, more, worthy, to, be, known, than, the, state, of, that, happy, land, but, above, all, (we, said, ), since, that, we, were, met, from, the, several, ends, of, the, world, and, hoped, assuredly, that, we, should, meet, one, day, in, the, kingdom, of, heaven, (for, that, we, were, both, parts, christians, ), we, desired, to, know, (in, respect, that, land, was, so, remote, and, so, divided, by, vast, and, unknown, seas, from, the, land, where, our, saviour, walked, on, earth, ), who, was, the, apostle, of, that, nation, and, how, it, was, converted, to, the, faith, it, appeared, in, his, face, that, he, took, great, contentment, in, this, our, question, he, said, ye, knit, my, heart, to, you, by, asking, this, question, in, the, first, place, for, it, sheweth, that, you, first, seek, the, kingdom, of, heaven, and, shall, gladly, and, briefly, satisfy, your, demand, about, twenty, years, after, the, ascension, of, our, saviour, it, came, to, pass, that, there, was, seen, by, the, people, of, renfusa, (a, city, upon, the, eastern, coast, of, our, island, ), within, night, (the, night, was, cloudy, and, calm, ), as, it, might, be, some, mile, into, the, sea, a, great, pillar, of, light, not, sharp, but, in, form, of, a, column, or, cylinder, rising, from, the, sea, a, great, way, up, towards, heaven, and, on, the, top, of, it, was, seen, a, large, cross, of, light, more, bright, and, resplendent, than, the, body, of, the, pillar, upon, which, so, strange, a, spectacle, the, people, of, the, city, gathered, apace, together, upon, the, sands, to, wonder, and, so, after, put, themselves, into, a, number, of, small, boats, to, go, nearer, to, this, marvellous, sight, but, when, the, boats, were, come, within, (about), sixty, yards, of, the, pillar, they, found, themselves, all, bound, and, could, go, no, further, yet, so, as, they, might, move, to, go, about, but, might, not, approach, nearer, so, as, the, boats, stood, all, as, in, a, theatre, beholding, this, light, as, an, heavenly, sign, it, so, fell, out, that, there, was, in, one, of, the, boats, one, of, the, wise, men, of, the, society, of, salomon's, house, which, house, or, college, (my, good, brethren), is, the, very, eye, of, this, kingdom, who, having, awhile, attentively, and, devoutly, viewed, and, contemplated, this, pillar, and, cross, fell, down, upon, his, face, and, then, raised, himself, upon, his, knees, and, lifting, up, his, hands, to, heaven, made, his, prayers, in, this, manner, god, of, heaven, and, earth, thou, hast, vouchsafed, of, thy, grace, to, those, of, our, order, to, know, thy, works, of, creation, and, the, secrets, of, them, and, to, discern, (as, far, as, appertaineth, to, the, generations, of, men), between, divine, miracles, works, of, nature, works, of, art, and, impostures, and, illusions, of, all, sorts, do, here, acknowledge, and, testify, before, this, people, that, the, thing, which, we, now, see, before, our, eyes, is, thy, finger, and, a, true, miracle, and, forasmuch, as, we, learn, in, our, books, that, thou, never, workest, miracles, but, to, divine, and, excellent, end, (for, the, laws, of, nature, are, thine, own, laws, and, thou, exceedest, them, not, but, upon, great, cause, ), we, most, humbly, beseech, thee, to, prosper, this, great, sign, and, to, give, us, the, interpretation, and, use, of, it, in, mercy, which, thou, dost, in, some, part, secretly, promise, by, sending, it, unto, us, ', when, he, had, made, his, prayer, he, presently, found, the, boat, he, was, in, moveable, and, unbound, whereas, all, the, rest, remained, still, fast, and, taking, that, for, an, assurance, of, leave, to, approach, he, caused, the, boat, to, be, softly, and, with, silence, rowed, towards, the, pillar, but, ere, he, came, near, it, the, pillar, and, cross, of, light, brake, up, and, cast, itself, abroad, as, it, were, into, a, firmament, of, many, stars, which, also, vanished, soon, after, and, there, was, nothing, left, to, be, seen, but, a, small, ark, or, chest, of, cedar, dry, and, not, wet, at, all, with, water, though, it, swam, and, in, the, fore-end, of, it, which, was, towards, him, grew, a, small, green, branch, of, palm, and, when, the, wise, man, had, taken, it, with, all, reverence, into, his, boat, it, opened, of, itself, and, there, were, found, in, it, a, book, and, a, letter, both, written, in, fine, parchment, and, wrapped, in, sindons, of, linen, the, book, contained, all, the, canonical, books, of, the, old, and, new, testament, according, as, you, have, them, (for, we, know, well, what, the, churches, with, you, receive), and, the, apocalypse, itself, and, some, other, books, of, the, new, testament, which, were, not, at, that, time, written, were, nevertheless, in, the, book, and, for, the, letter, it, was, in, these, words, bartholomew, a, servant, of, the, highest, and, apostle, of, jesus, christ, was, warned, by, an, angel, that, appeareth, to, me, in, a, vision, of, glory, that, should, commit, this, ark, to, the, floods, of, the, sea, therefore, do, testify, and, declare, unto, that, people, where, god, shall, ordain, this, ark, to, come, to, land, that, in, the, same, day, is, come, unto, them, salvation, and, peace, and, good-will, from, the, father, and, from, the, lord, jesus, ', there, was, also, in, both, these, writings, as, well, the, book, as, the, letter, wrought, a, great, miracle, conform, to, that, of, the, apostles, in, the, original, gift, of, tongues, for, there, being, at, that, time, in, this, land, hebrews, persians, and, indians, besides, the, natives, every, one, read, upon, the, book, and, letter, as, if, they, had, been, written, in, his, own, language, and, thus, was, this, land, saved, from, infidelity, (as, the, remainder, of, the, old, world, was, from, water), by, an, ark, through, the, apostolical, and, miraculous, evangelism, of, saint, bartholomew, and, here, he, paused, and, a, messenger, came, and, called, him, from, us, so, this, was, all, that, passed, in, that, conference, the, next, day, the, same, governor, came, again, to, us, immediately, after, dinner, and, excused, himself, saying, that, the, day, before, he, was, called, from, us, somewhat, abruptly, but, now, he, would, make, us, amends, and, spend, time, with, us, if, we, held, his, company, and, conference, agreeable, we, answered, that, we, held, it, so, agreeable, and, pleasing, to, us, as, we, forgot, both, dangers, past, and, fears, to, come, for, the, time, we, hear, him, speak, and, that, we, thought, an, hour, spent, with, him, was, worth, years, of, our, former, life, he, bowed, himself, a, little, to, us, and, after, we, were, set, again, he, said, well, the, questions, are, on, your, part, one, of, our, number, said, after, a, little, pause, that, there, was, a, matter, we, were, no, less, desirous, to, know, than, fearful, to, ask, lest, we, might, presume, too, far, but, encouraged, by, his, rare, humanity, towards, us, (that, could, scarce, think, ourselves, strangers, being, his, vowed, and, professed, servants, ), we, would, take, the, hardiness, to, propound, it, humbly, beseeching, him, if, he, thought, it, not, fit, to, be, answered, that, he, would, pardon, it, though, he, rejected, it, we, said, we, well, observed, those, his, words, which, he, formerly, spake, that, this, happy, island, where, we, now, stood, was, known, to, few, and, yet, knew, most, of, the, nations, of, the, world, which, we, found, to, be, true, considering, they, had, the, languages, of, europe, and, knew, much, of, our, state, and, business, and, yet, we, in, europe, (notwithstanding, all, the, remote, discoveries, and, navigations, of, this, last, age), never, heard, of, the, least, inkling, or, glimpse, of, this, island, this, we, found, wonderful, strange, for, that, all, nations, have, inter-knowledge, one, of, another, either, by, voyage, into, foreign, parts, or, by, strangers, that, come, to, them, and, though, the, traveller, into, a, foreign, country, doth, commonly, know, more, by, the, eye, than, he, that, stayeth, at, home, can, by, relation, of, the, traveller, yet, both, ways, suffice, to, make, a, mutual, knowledge, in, some, degree, on, both, parts, but, for, this, island, we, never, heard, tell, of, any, ship, of, theirs, that, had, been, seen, to, arrive, upon, any, shore, of, europe, nor, of, either, the, east, or, west, indies, nor, yet, of, any, ship, of, any, other, part, of, the, world, that, had, made, return, from, them, and, yet, the, marvel, rested, not, in, this, for, the, situation, of, it, (as, his, lordship, said), in, the, secret, conclave', of, such, a, vast, sea, might, cause, it, but, then, that, they, should, have, knowledge, of, the, languages, books, affairs, of, those, that, lie, such, a, distance, from, them, it, was, a, thing, we, could, not, tell, what, to, make, of, for, that, it, seemed, to, us, a, conditioner, and, propriety, of, divine, powers, and, beings, to, be, hidden, and, unseen, to, others, and, yet, to, have, others, open, and, as, in, a, light, to, them, at, this, speech, the, governor, gave, a, gracious, smile, and, said, that, we, did, well, to, ask, pardon, for, this, question, we, now, asked, for, that, it, imported, as, if, we, thought, this, land, a, land, of, magicians, that, sent, forth, spirits, of, the, air, into, all, parts, to, bring, them, news, and, intelligence, of, other, countries, it, was, answered, by, us, all, in, all, possible, humbleness, but, yet, with, a, countenance, taking, knowledge, that, we, knew, that, he, spake, it, but, merrily, that, we, were, apt, enough, to, think, there, was, somewhat, supernatural, in, this, island, but, yet, rather, as, angelical, than, magical, but, to, let, his, lordship, know, truly, what, it, was, that, made, us, tender, and, doubtful, to, ask, this, question, it, was, not, any, such, conceit, but, because, we, remembered, he, had, given, a, touch, in, his, former, speech, that, this, land, had, laws, of, secrecy, touching, strangers, to, this, he, said, you, remember, it, aright, and, therefore, in, that, shall, say, to, you, must, reserve, some, particulars, which, it, is, not, lawful, for, me, to, reveal, but, there, will, be, enough, left, to, give, you, satisfaction, you, shall, understand, (that, which, perhaps, you, will, scarce, think, credible), that, about, three, thousand, years, ago, or, somewhat, more, the, navigation, of, the, world, (especially, for, remote, voyages, ), was, greater, than, at, this, day, do, not, think, with, yourselves, that, know, not, how, much, it, is, increased, with, you, within, these, six-score, years, know, it, well, and, yet, say, greater, then, than, now, whether, it, was, that, the, example, of, the, ark, that, saved, the, remnant, of, men, from, the, universal, deluge, gave, men, confidence, to, adventure, upon, the, waters, or, what, it, was, but, such, is, the, truth, the, phoenicians, and, especially, the, tyrians, had, great, fleets, so, had, the, carthaginians, their, colony, which, is, yet, further, west, toward, the, east, the, shipping, of, egypt, and, of, palestine, was, likewise, great, china, also, and, the, great, atlantis, (that, you, call, america, ), which, have, now, but, junks, and, canoes, abounded, then, in, tall, ships, this, island, (as, appeareth, by, faithful, registers, of, those, times, ), had, then, fifteen, hundred, strong, ships, of, great, content, of, all, this, there, is, with, you, sparing, memory, or, none, but, we, have, large, knowledge, thereof, at, that, time, this, land, was, known, and, frequented, by, the, ships, and, vessels, of, all, the, nations, before, named, and, (as, it, cometh, to, pass), they, had, many, times, men, of, other, countries, that, were, no, sailors, that, came, with, them, as, persians, chaldeans, arabians, so, as, almost, all, nations, of, might, and, fame, resorted, hither, of, whom, we, have, some, stirps, and, little, tribes, with, us, at, this, day, and, for, our, own, ships, they, went, sundry, voyages, as, well, to, your, straits, which, you, call, the, pillars, of, hercules, as, to, other, parts, in, the, atlantic, and, mediterrane, seas, as, to, paguin, (which, is, the, same, with, cambaline, ), and, quinzy, upon, the, oriental, seas, as, far, as, to, the, borders, of, the, east, tartary, at, the, same, time, and, an, age, after, or, more, the, inhabitants, of, the, great, atlantis, did, flourish, for, though, the, narration, and, description, which, is, made, by, a, great, man, with, you, that, the, descendants, of, neptune, planted, there, and, of, the, magnificent, temple, palace, city, and, hill, and, the, manifold, streams, of, goodly, navigable, rivers, (which, as, so, many, chains, environed, the, same, site, and, temple), and, the, several, degrees, of, ascent, whereby, men, did, climb, up, to, the, same, as, if, it, had, been, a, scala, coeli, be, all, poetical, and, fabulous, yet, so, much, is, true, that, the, said, country, of, atlantis, as, well, that, of, peru, then, called, coya, as, that, of, mexico, then, named, tyrambel, were, mighty, and, proud, kingdoms, in, arms, shipping, and, riches, so, mighty, as, at, one, time, (or, at, least, within, the, space, of, ten, years), they, both, made, two, great, expeditions, they, of, tyrambel, through, the, atlantic, to, the, mediterrane, sea, and, they, of, coya, through, the, south, sea, upon, this, our, island, and, for, the, former, of, these, which, was, into, europe, the, same, author, amongst, you, (as, it, seemeth), had, some, relation, from, the, egyptian, priest, whom, he, cited, for, assuredly, such, a, thing, there, was, but, whether, it, were, the, ancient, athenians, that, had, the, glory, of, the, repulse, and, resistance, of, those, forces, can, say, nothing, but, certain, it, is, there, never, came, back, either, ship, or, man, from, that, voyage, neither, had, the, other, voyage, of, those, of, coya, upon, us, had, better, fortune, if, they, had, not, met, with, enemies, of, greater, clemency, for, the, king, of, this, island, (by, name, altabin, ), a, wise, man, and, a, great, warrior, knowing, well, both, his, own, strength, and, that, of, his, enemies, handled, the, matter, so, as, he, cut, off, their, land-forces, from, their, ships, and, entoiled, both, their, navy, and, their, tamp, with, a, greater, power, than, theirs, both, by, sea, and, land, arid, compelled, them, to, render, themselves, without, striking, stroke, and, after, they, were, at, his, mercy, contenting, himself, only, with, their, oath, that, they, should, no, more, bear, arms, against, him, dismissed, them, all, in, safety, but, the, divine, revenge, overtook, not, long, after, those, proud, enterprises, for, within, less, than, the, space, of, one, hundred, years, the, great, atlantis, was, utterly, lost, and, destroyed, not, by, a, great, earthquake, as, your, man, saith, (for, that, whole, tract, is, little, subject, to, earthquakes, ), but, by, a, particular', deluge, or, inundation, those, countries, having, at, this, day, far, greater, rivers, and, far, higher, mountains, to, pour, down, waters, than, any, part, of, the, old, world, but, it, is, true, that, the, same, inundation, was, not, deep, not, past, forty, foot, in, most, places, from, the, ground, so, that, although, it, destroyed, man, and, beast, generally, yet, some, few, wild, inhabitants, of, the, wood, escaped, birds, also, were, saved, by, flying, to, the, high, trees, and, woods, for, as, for, men, although, they, had, buildings, in, many, places, higher, than, the, depth, of, the, water, yet, that, inundation, though, it, were, shallow, had, a, long, continuance, whereby, they, of, the, vale, that, were, not, drowned, perished, for, want, of, food, and, other, things, necessary, so, as, marvel, you, not, at, the, thin, population, of, america, nor, at, the, rudeness, and, ignorance, of, the, people, for, you, must, account, your, inhabitants, of, america, as, a, young, people, younger, a, thousand, years, at, the, least, than, the, rest, of, the, world, for, that, there, was, so, much, time, between, the, universal, flood, and, their, particular, inundation, for, the, poor, remnant, of, human, seed, which, remained, in, their, mountains, peopled, the, country, again, slowly, by, little, and, little, and, being, simple, and, savage, people, (not, like, noah, and, his, sons, which, was, the, chief, family, of, the, earth, ), they, were, not, able, to, leave, letters, arts, and, civility, to, their, posterity, and, having, likewise, in, their, mountainous, habitations, been, used, (in, respect, of, the, extreme, cold, of, those, regions), to, clothe, themselves, with, the, skins, of, tigers, bears, and, great, hairy, goats, that, they, have, in, those, parts, when, after, they, came, down, into, the, valley, and, found, the, intolerable, heats, which, are, there, and, knew, no, means, of, lighter, apparel, they, were, forced, to, begin, the, custom, of, going, naked, which, continueth, at, this, day, only, they, take, great, pride, and, delight, in, the, feathers, of, birds, and, this, also, they, took, from, those, their, ancestors, of, the, mountains, who, were, invited, unto, it, by, the, infinite, flights, of, birds, that, came, up, to, the, high, grounds, while, the, waters, stood, below, so, you, see, by, this, main, accident, of, time, we, lost, our, traffic, with, the, americans, with, whom, of, all, others, in, regard, they, lay, nearest, to, us, we, had, most, commerce, as, for, the, other, parts, of, the, world, it, is, most, manifest, that, in, the, ages, following, (whether, it, were, in, respect, of, wars, or, by, a, natural, revolution, of, time, ), navigation, did, every, where, greatly, decay, and, specially, far, voyages, (the, rather, by, the, use, of, galleys, and, such, vessels, as, could, hardly, brook, the, ocean, ), were, altogether, left, and, omitted, so, then, that, part, of, intercourse, which, could, be, from, other, nations, to, sail, to, us, you, see, how, it, hath, long, since, ceased, except, it, were, by, some, rare, accident, as, this, of, yours, but, now, of, the, cessation, of, that, other, part, of, intercourse, which, might, be, by, our, sailing, to, other, nations, must, yield, you, some, other, cause, for, cannot, say, (if, shall, say, truly, ), but, our, shipping, for, number, strength, mariners, pilots, and, all, things, that, appertain, to, navigation, is, as, great, as, ever, and, therefore, why, we, should, sit, at, home, shall, now, give, you, an, account, by, itself, and, it, will, draw, nearer, to, give, you, satisfaction, to, your, principal, question, there, reigned, in, this, land, about, nineteen, hundred, years, ago, a, king, whose, memory, of, all, others, we, most, adore, not, superstitiously, but, as, a, divine, instrument, though, a, mortal, man, his, name, was, solamona, and, we, esteem, him, as, the, lawgiver, of, our, nation, this, king, had, a, large, heart, inscrutable, for, good, and, was, wholly, bent, to, make, his, kingdom, and, people, happy, he, therefore, taking, into, consideration, how, sufficient, and, substantive, this, land, was, to, maintain, itself, without, any, aid, (at, all), of, the, foreigner, being, five, thousand, six, hundred, miles, in, circuit, and, of, rare, fertility, of, soil, in, the, greatest, part, thereof, and, finding, also, the, shipping, of, this, country, might, be, plentifully, set, on, work, both, by, fishing, and, by, transportations, from, port, to, port, and, likewise, by, sailing, unto, some, small, islands, that, are, not, far, from, us, and, are, under, the, crown, and, laws, of, this, state, and, recalling, into, his, memory, the, happy, and, flourishing, estate, wherein, this, land, then, was, so, as, it, might, be, a, thousand, ways, altered, to, the, worse, but, scarce, any, one, way, to, the, better, thought, nothing, wanted, to, his, noble, and, heroical, intentions, but, only, (as, far, as, human, foresight, might, reach), to, give, perpetuity, to, that, which, was, in, his, time, so, happily, established, therefore, amongst, his, other, fundamental, laws, of, this, kingdom, he, did, ordain, the, interdicts, and, prohibitions, which, we, have, touching, entrance, of, strangers, which, at, that, time, (though, it, was, after, the, calamity, of, america), was, frequent, doubting, novelties, and, commixture, of, manners, it, is, true, the, like, law, against, the, admission, of, strangers, without, licence, is, an, ancient, law, in, the, kingdom, of, china, and, yet, continued, in, use, but, there, it, is, a, poor, thing, and, hath, made, them, a, curious, ignorant, fearful, foolish, nation, but, our, lawgiver, made, his, law, of, another, temper, for, first, he, hath, preserved, all, points, of, humanity, in, taking, order, and, making, provision, for, the, relief, of, strangers, distressed, whereof, you, have, tasted, at, which, speech, (as, reason, was), we, all, rose, up, and, bowed, ourselves, he, went, on, that, king, also, still, desiring, to, join, humanity, and, policy, together, and, thinking, it, against, humanity, to, detain, strangers, here, against, their, wills, and, against, policy, that, they, should, return, and, discover, their, knowledge, of, this, estate, he, took, this, course, he, did, ordain, that, of, the, strangers, that, should, be, permitted, to, land, as, many, (at, all, times), might, depart, as, would, but, as, many, as, would, stay, should, have, very, good, conditions, and, means, to, live, from, the, state, wherein, he, saw, so, far, that, now, in, so, many, ages, since, the, prohibition, we, have, memory, not, of, one, ship, that, ever, returned, and, but, of, thirteen, persons, only, at, several, times, that, chose, to, return, in, our, bottoms, what, those, few, that, returned, may, have, reported, abroad, know, not, but, you, must, think, whatsoever, they, have, said, could, be, taken, where, they, came, but, for, a, dream, now, for, our, travelling, from, henna, into, parts, abroad, our, lawgiver, thought, fit, altogether, to, restrain, it, so, is, it, not, in, china, for, the, chinese, sail, where, they, will, or, can, which, sheweth, that, their, law, of, keeping, out, strangers, is, a, law, of, pusillanimity, and, fear, but, this, restraint, of, ours, hath, one, only, exception, which, is, admirable, preserving, the, good, which, cometh, by, communicating, with, strangers, and, avoiding, the, hurt, and, will, now, open, it, to, you, and, here, shall, seem, a, little, to, digress, but, you, will, by, and, by, find, it, pertinent, ye, shall, understand, (my, dear, friends), that, amongst, the, excellent, acts, of, that, king, one, above, all, hath, the, pre-eminence, it, was, the, erection, and, institution, of, an, order, or, society, which, we, call, salomon's, house, the, noblest, foundation, (as, we, think), that, ever, was, upon, the, earth, and, the, lanthorn, of, this, kingdom, it, is, dedicated, to, the, study, of, the, works, and, creatures, of, god, some, think, it, beareth, the, founder's, name, a, little, corrupted, as, if, it, should, be, solamona's, house, but, the, records, write, it, as, it, is, spoken, so, as, take, it, to, be, denominate, of, the, king, of, the, hebrews, which, is, famous, with, you, and, no, stranger, to, us, for, we, have, some, parts, of, his, works, which, with, you, are, lost, namely, that, natural, history, which, he, wrote, of, all, plants, from, the, cedar, of, libanus, to, the, moss, that, groweth, out, of, the, wall, and, of, all, things, that, have, life, and, motion, this, maketh, me, think, that, our, king, finding, himself, to, symbolize, in, many, things, with, that, king, of, the, hebrews, (which, lived, many, years, before, him), honored, him, with, the, title, of, this, foundation, and, am, rather, induced, to, be, of, this, opinion, for, that, find, in, ancient, records, this, order, or, society, is, sometimes, called, salomon's, house, and, sometimes, the, college, of, the, six, days, works, whereby, am, satisfied, that, our, excellent, king, had, learned, from, the, hebrews, that, god, had, created, the, world, and, all, that, therein, is, within, six, days, and, therefore, he, instituting, that, house, for, the, finding, out, of, the, true, nature, of, all, things, (whereby, god, might, have, the, more, glory, in, the, workmanship, of, them, and, insert, the, more, fruit, in, the, use, of, them), did, give, it, also, that, second, name, but, now, to, come, to, our, present, purpose, when, the, king, had, forbidden, to, all, his, people, navigation, into, any, part, that, was, not, under, his, crown, he, made, nevertheless, this, ordinance, that, every, twelve, years, there, should, be, set, forth, out, of, this, kingdom, two, ships, appointed, to, several, voyages, that, in, either, of, these, ships, there, should, be, a, mission, of, three, of, the, fellows, or, brethren, of, salomon's, house, whose, errand, was, only, to, give, us, knowledge, of, the, affairs, and, state, of, those, countries, to, which, they, were, designed, and, especially, of, the, sciences, arts, manufactures, and, inventions, of, all, the, world, and, withal, to, bring, unto, us, books, instruments, and, patterns, in, every, kind, that, the, ships, after, they, had, landed, the, brethren, should, return, and, that, the, brethren, should, stay, abroad, till, the, new, mission, these, ships, are, not, otherwise, fraught, than, with, store, of, victuals, and, good, quantity, of, treasure, to, remain, with, the, brethren, for, the, buying, of, such, things, and, rewarding, of, such, persons, as, they, should, think, fit, now, for, me, to, tell, you, how, the, vulgar, sort, of, mariners, are, contained, from, being, discovered, at, land, and, how, they, that, must, be, put, on, shore, for, any, time, color, themselves, under, the, names, of, other, nations, and, to, what, places, these, voyages, have, been, designed, and, what, places, of, rendezvous, are, appointed, for, the, new, missions, and, the, like, circumstances, of, the, practique, may, not, do, it, neither, is, it, much, to, your, desire, but, thus, you, see, we, maintain, a, trade, not, for, gold, silver, or, jewels, nor, for, silks, nor, for, spices, nor, any, other, commodity, of, matter, but, only, for, god's, first, creature, which, was, light, to, have, light, say), of, the, growth, of, all, parts, of, the, world, and, when, he, had, said, this, he, was, silent, and, so, were, we, all, for, indeed, we, were, all, astonished, to, hear, so, strange, things, so, probably, told, and, he, perceiving, that, we, were, willing, to, say, somewhat, but, had, it, not, ready, in, great, courtesy, took, us, off, and, descended, to, ask, us, questions, of, our, voyage, and, fortunes, and, in, the, end, concluded, that, we, might, do, well, to, think, with, ourselves, what, time, of, stay, we, would, demand, of, the, state, and, bade, us, not, to, scant, ourselves, for, he, would, procure, such, time, as, we, desired, whereupon, we, all, rose, up, and, presented, ourselves, to, kiss, the, skirt, of, his, tippet, but, he, would, not, suffer, us, and, so, took, his, leave, but, when, it, came, once, amongst, our, people, that, the, state, used, to, offer, conditions, to, strangers, that, would, stay, we, had, work, enough, to, get, any, of, our, men, to, look, to, our, ship, and, to, keep, them, from, going, presently, to, the, governor, to, crave, conditions, but, with, much, ado, we, refrained, them, till, we, might, agree, what, course, to, take, we, took, ourselves, now, for, free, men, seeing, there, was, no, danger, of, our, utter, perdition, and, lived, most, joyfully, going, abroad, and, seeing, what, was, to, be, seen, in, the, city, and, places, adjacent, within, our, tedder, and, obtaining, acquaintance, with, many, of, the, city, not, of, the, meanest, quality, at, whose, hands, we, found, such, humanity, and, such, a, freedom, and, desire, to, take, strangers, as, it, were, into, their, bosom, as, was, enough, to, make, us, forget, all, that, was, dear, to, us, in, our, own, countries, and, continually, we, met, with, many, things, right, worthy, of, observation, and, relation, as, indeed, if, there, be, a, mirror, in, the, world, worthy, to, hold, men's, eyes, it, is, that, country, one, day, there, were, two, of, our, company, bidden, to, a, feast, of, the, family, as, they, call, it, most, natural, pious, and, reverend, custom, it, is, shewing, that, nation, to, be, compounded, of, all, goodness, this, is, the, manner, of, it, it, is, granted, to, any, man, that, shall, live, to, see, thirty, persons, descended, of, his, body, alive, together, and, all, above, three, years, old, to, make, this, feast, which, is, done, at, the, cost, of, the, state, the, father, of, the, family, whom, they, call, the, tirsan, two, days, before, the, feast, taketh, to, him, three, of, such, friends, as, he, liketh, to, choose, and, is, assisted, also, by, the, governor, of, the, city, or, place, where, the, feast, is, celebrated, and, all, the, persons, of, the, family, of, both, sexes, are, summoned, to, attend, him, these, two, days, the, tirsan, sitteth, in, consultation, concerning, the, good, estate, of, the, family, there, if, there, be, any, discord, or, suits, between, any, of, the, family, they, are, compounded, and, appeased, there, if, any, of, the, family, be, distressed, or, decayed, order, is, taken, for, their, relief, and, competent, means, to, live, there, if, any, be, subject, to, vice, or, take, ill, courses, they, are, reproved, and, censured, so, likewise, direction, is, given, touching, marriages, and, the, courses, of, life, which, any, of, them, should, take, with, divers, other, the, like, orders, and, advices, the, governor, assisteth, to, the, end, to, put, in, execution, by, his, public, authority, the, decrees, and, orders, of, the, tirsan, if, they, should, be, disobeyed, though, that, seldom, needeth, such, reverence, and, obedience, they, give, to, the, order, of, nature, the, tirsan, doth, also, then, ever, choose, one, man, from, among, his, sons, to, live, in, house, with, him, who, is, called, ever, after, the, son, of, the, vine, the, reason, will, hereafter, appear, on, the, feast, day, the, father, or, tirsan, cometh, forth, after, divine, service, into, a, large, room, where, the, feast, is, celebrated, which, room, hath, an, half-pace, at, the, upper, end, against, the, wall, in, the, middle, of, the, half-pace, is, a, chair, placed, for, him, with, a, table, and, carpet, before, it, over, the, chair, is, a, state, made, round, or, oval, and, it, is, of, ivy, an, ivy, somewhat, whiter, than, ours, like, the, leaf, of, a, silver, asp, but, more, shining, for, it, is, green, all, winter, and, the, state, is, curiously, wrought, with, silver, and, silk, of, divers, colors, broiding, or, binding, in, the, ivy, and, is, ever, of, the, work, of, some, of, the, daughters, of, the, family, and, veiled, over, at, the, top, with, a, fine, net, of, silk, and, silver, but, the, substance, of, it, is, true, ivy, whereof, after, it, is, taken, down, the, friends, of, the, family, are, desirous, to, have, some, leaf, or, sprig, to, keep, the, tirsan, cometh, forth, with, all, his, generation, or, linage, the, males, before, him, and, the, females, following, him, and, if, there, be, a, mother, from, whose, body, the, whole, linage, is, descended, there, is, a, traverse, placed, in, a, loft, above, on, the, right, hand, of, the, chair, with, a, privy, door, and, a, carved, window, of, glass, leaded, with, gold, and, blue, where, she, sitteth, but, is, not, seen, when, the, tirsan, is, come, forth, he, sitteth, down, in, the, chair, and, all, the, linage, place, themselves, against, the, wall, both, at, his, back, and, upon, the, return, of, the, half-pace, in, order, of, their, years, without, difference, of, sex, and, stand, upon, their, feet, when, he, is, set, the, room, being, always, full, of, company, but, well, kept, and, without, disorder, after, some, pause, there, cometh, in, from, the, lower, end, of, the, room, a, taratan, (which, is, as, much, as, an, herald), and, on, either, side, of, him, two, young, lads, whereof, one, carrieth, a, scroll, of, their, shining, yellow, parchment, and, the, other, a, cluster, of, grapes, of, gold, with, a, long, foot, or, stalk, the, herald, and, children, are, clothed, with, mantles, of, sea-water, green, satin, but, the, herald's, mantle, is, streamed, with, gold, and, hath, a, train, then, the, herald, with, three, curtesies, or, rather, inclinations, cometh, up, as, far, as, the, half-pace, and, there, first, taketh, into, his, hand, the, scroll, this, scroll, is, the, king's, charter, containing, gifts, of, revenew, and, many, privileges, exemptions, and, points, of, honour, granted, to, the, father, of, the, family, and, is, ever, styled, and, directed, to, such, do, one, our, well, beloved, friend, and, creditor, which, is, a, title, proper, only, to, this, case, for, they, say, the, king, is, debtor, to, no, man, but, for, propagation, of, his, subjects, the, seal, set, to, the, king's, charter, is, the, king's, image, imbossed, or, moulded, in, gold, and, though, such, charters, be, expedited, of, course, and, as, of, right, yet, they, are, varied, by, discretion, according, to, the, number, and, dignity, of, the, family, this, charter, the, herald, readeth, aloud, and, while, it, is, read, the, father, or, tirsan, standeth, up, supported, by, two, of, his, sons, such, as, he, chooseth, then, the, herald, mounteth, the, half-pace, and, delivereth, the, charter, into, his, hand, and, with, that, there, is, an, acclamation, by, all, that, are, present, in, their, language, which, is, thus, much, happy, are, the, people, of, bensalem, then, the, herald, taketh, into, his, hand, from, the, other, child, the, cluster, of, grapes, which, is, of, gold, both, the, stalk, and, the, grapes, but, the, grapes, are, daintily, enamelled, and, if, the, males, of, the, family, be, the, greater, number, the, grapes, are, enamelled, purple, with, a, little, sun, set, on, the, top, if, the, females, then, they, are, enamelled, into, a, greenish, yellow, with, a, crescent, on, the, top, the, grapes, are, in, number, as, many, as, there, are, descendants, of, the, family, this, golden, cluster, the, herald, delivereth, also, to, the, tirsan, who, presently, delivereth, it, over, to, that, son, that, he, had, formerly, chosen, to, be, in, house, with, him, who, beareth, it, before, his, father, as, an, ensign, of, honour, when, he, goeth, in, public, ever, after, and, is, thereupon, called, the, son, of, the, vine, after, the, ceremony, endeth, the, father, or, tirsan, retireth, and, after, some, time, cometh, forth, again, to, dinner, where, he, sitteth, alone, under, the, state, as, before, and, none, of, his, descendants, sit, with, him, of, what, degree, or, dignity, soever, except, he, hap, to, be, of, salomon's, house, he, is, served, only, by, his, own, children, such, as, are, male, who, perform, unto, him, all, service, of, the, table, upon, the, knee, and, the, women, only, stand, about, him, leaning, against, the, wall, the, room, below, the, half-pace, hath, tables, on, the, sides, for, the, guests, that, are, bidden, who, are, served, with, great, and, comely, order, and, towards, the, end, of, dinner, (which, in, the, greatest, feasts, with, them, lasteth, never, above, an, hour, and, an, half), there, is, an, hymn, sung, varied, according, to, the, invention, of, him, that, composeth, it, (for, they, have, excellent, posy), but, the, subject, of, it, is, (always), the, praises, of, adam, and, noah, and, abraham, whereof, the, former, two, peopled, the, world, and, the, last, was, the, father, of, the, faithful, concluding, ever, with, a, thanksgiving, for, the, nativity, of, our, saviour, in, whose, birth, the, births, of, all, are, only, blessed, dinner, being, done, the, tirsan, retireth, again, and, having, withdrawn, himself, alone, into, a, place, where, he, makes, some, private, prayers, he, cometh, forth, the, third, time, to, give, the, blessing, with, all, his, descendants, who, stand, about, him, as, at, the, first, then, he, calleth, them, forth, by, one, and, by, one, by, name, as, he, pleaseth, though, seldom, the, order, of, age, be, inverted, the, person, that, is, called, (the, table, being, before, removed), kneeleth, down, before, the, chair, and, the, father, layeth, his, hand, upon, his, head, or, her, head, and, giveth, the, blessing, in, these, words, son, of, bensalem, (or, daughter, of, bensalem, ), thy, father, with, it, the, man, by, whom, thou, hast, breath, and, life, speaketh, the, word, the, blessing, of, the, everlasting, father, the, prince, of, peace, and, the, holy, dove, be, upon, thee, and, make, the, days, of, thy, pilgrimage, good, and, many, this, he, saith, to, every, of, them, and, that, done, if, there, be, any, of, his, sons, of, eminent, merit, and, virtue, (so, they, be, not, above, two, ), he, calleth, for, them, again, and, saith, laying, his, arm, over, their, shoulders, they, standing, sons, it, is, well, ye, are, born, give, god, the, praise, and, persevere, to, the, end, and, withall, delivereth, to, either, of, them, a, jewel, made, in, the, figure, of, an, ear, of, wheat, which, they, ever, after, wear, in, the, front, of, their, turban, or, hat, this, done, they, fall, to, music, and, dances, and, other, recreations, after, their, manner, for, the, rest, of, the, day, this, is, the, full, order, of, that, feast, by, that, time, six, or, seven, days, were, spent, was, fallen, into, straight, acquaintance, with, a, merchant, of, that, city, whose, name, was, joabin, he, was, a, jew, and, circumcised, for, they, have, some, few, stirps, of, jews, yet, remaining, among, them, whom, they, leave, to, their, own, religion, which, they, may, the, better, do, because, they, are, of, a, far, differing, disposition, from, the, jews, in, other, parts, for, whereas, they, hate, the, name, of, christ, and, have, a, secret, inbred, rancour, against, the, people, among, whom, they, live, these, (contrariwise), give, unto, our, saviour, many, high, attributes, and, love, the, nation, of, bensalem, extremely, surely, this, man, of, whom, speak, would, ever, acknowledge, that, christ, was, born, of, a, virgin, and, that, he, was, more, than, a, man, and, he, would, tell, how, god, made, him, ruler, of, the, seraphims, which, guard, his, throne, and, they, call, him, also, the, milken, way, and, the, eliah, of, the, messiah, and, many, other, high, names, which, though, they, be, inferior, to, his, divine, majesty, yet, they, are, far, from, the, language, of, other, jews, and, for, the, country, of, bensalem, this, man, would, make, no, end, of, commending, it, being, desirous, by, tradition, among, the, jews, there, to, have, it, believed, that, the, people, thereof, were, of, the, generations, of, abraham, by, another, son, whom, they, call, nachoran, and, that, moses, by, a, secret, cabala, ordained, the, laws, of, bensalem, which, they, now, use, and, that, when, the, messiah, should, come, and, sit, in, his, throne, at, hierusalem, the, king, of, bensalem, should, sit, at, his, feet, whereas, other, kings, should, keep, a, great, distance, but, yet, setting, aside, these, jewish, dreams, the, man, was, a, wise, man, and, learned, and, of, great, policy, and, excellently, seen, in, the, laws, and, customs, of, that, nation, amongst, other, discourses, one, day, told, him, was, much, affected, with, the, relation, had, from, some, of, the, company, of, their, custom, in, holding, the, feast, of, the, family, for, that, (methought), had, never, heard, of, a, solemnity, wherein, nature, did, so, much, preside, and, because, propagation, of, families, proceedeth, from, the, nuptial, copulation, desired, to, know, of, him, what, laws, and, customs, they, had, concerning, marriage, and, whether, they, kept, marriage, well, and, whether, they, were, tied, to, one, wife, for, that, where, population, is, so, much, affected, ', and, such, as, with, them, it, seemed, to, be, there, is, commonly, permission, of, plurality, of, wives, to, this, he, said, you, have, reason, for, to, commend, that, excellent, institution, of, the, feast, of, the, family, and, indeed, we, have, experience, that, those, families, that, are, partakers, of, the, blessing, of, that, feast, do, flourish, and, prosper, ever, after, in, an, extraordinary, manner, but, hear, me, now, and, will, tell, you, what, know, you, shall, understand, that, there, is, not, under, the, heavens, so, chaste, a, nation, as, this, of, bensalem, nor, so, free, from, all, pollution, or, foulness, it, is, the, virgin, of, the, world, remember, have, read, in, one, of, your, european, books, of, an, holy, hermit, amongst, you, that, desired, to, see, the, spirit, of, fornication, and, there, appeared, to, him, a, little, foul, ugly, aethiop, but, if, he, had, desired, to, see, the, spirit, of, chastity, of, bensalem, it, would, have, appeared, to, him, in, the, likeness, of, a, fair, beautiful, cherubim, for, there, is, nothing, amongst, mortal, men, more, fair, and, admirable, than, the, chaste, minds, of, this, people, know, therefore, that, with, them, there, are, no, stews, no, dissolute, houses, no, courtesans, nor, anything, of, that, kind, nay, they, wonder, (with, detestation), at, you, in, europe, which, permit, such, things, they, say, ye, have, put, marriage, out, of, office, for, marriage, is, ordained, a, remedy, for, unlawful, concupiscence, and, natural, concupiscence, seemeth, as, a, spar, to, marriage, but, when, men, have, at, hand, a, remedy, more, agreeable, to, their, corrupt, will, marriage, is, almost, expulsed, and, therefore, there, are, with, you, seen, infinite, men, that, marry, not, but, chose, rather, a, libertine, and, impure, single, life, than, to, be, yoked, in, marriage, and, many, that, do, marry, marry, late, when, the, prime, and, strength, of, their, years, is, past, and, when, they, do, marry, what, is, marriage, to, them, but, a, very, bargain, wherein, is, sought, alliance, or, portion, or, reputation, with, some, desire, (almost, indifferent), of, issue, and, not, the, faithful, nuptial, union, of, man, and, wife, that, was, first, instituted, neither, is, it, possible, that, those, that, have, cast, away, so, basely, so, much, of, their, strength, should, greatly, esteem, children, (being, of, the, same, matter, ), as, chaste, men, do, so, likewise, during, marriage, is, the, case, much, amended, as, it, ought, to, be, if, those, things, were, tolerated, only, for, necessity, no, but, they, remain, still, as, a, very, affront, to, marriage, the, haunting, of, those, dissolute, places, or, resort, to, courtesans, are, no, more, punished, in, married, men, than, in, bachelors, and, the, depraved, custom, of, change, and, the, delight, in, meretricious, embracements, (where, sin, is, turned, into, art, ), maketh, marriage, a, dull, thing, and, a, kind, of, imposition, or, tax, they, hear, you, defend, these, things, as, done, to, avoid, greater, evils, as, advoutries, deflowering, of, virgins, unnatural, lust, and, the, like, but, they, say, this, is, a, preposterous, wisdom, and, they, call, it, lot's, offer, who, to, save, his, guests, from, abusing, offered, his, daughters, nay, they, say, farther, that, there, is, little, gained, in, this, for, that, the, same, vices, and, appetites, do, still, remain, and, abound, unlawful, lust, being, like, a, furnace, that, if, you, stop, the, flames, altogether, it, will, quench, but, if, you, give, it, any, vent, it, will, rage, as, for, masculine, love, they, have, no, touch, of, it, and, yet, there, are, not, so, faithful, and, inviolate, friendships, in, the, world, again, as, are, there, and, to, speak, generally, (as, said, before, ), have, not, read, of, any, such, chastity, in, any, people, as, theirs, and, their, usual, saying, is, that, whosoever, is, unchaste, cannot, reverence, himself, and, they, say, that, the, reverence, of, a, man's, self, is, next, to, religion, the, chiefest, bridle, of, all, vices, and, when, he, had, said, this, the, good, jew, paused, a, little, whereupon, far, more, willing, to, hear, him, speak, on, than, to, speak, myself, yet, thinking, it, decent, that, upon, his, pause, of, speech, should, not, be, altogether, silent, said, only, this, that, would, say, to, him, as, the, widow, of, sarepta, said, to, elias, that, he, was, come, to, bring, to, memory, our, sins, and, that, confess, the, righteousness, of, bensalem, was, greater, than, the, righteousness, of, europe, at, which, speech, he, bowed, his, head, and, went, on, in, this, manner, they, have, also, many, wise, and, excellent, laws, touching, marriage, they, allow, no, polygamy, they, have, ordained, that, none, do, intermarry, or, contract, until, a, month, be, past, from, their, first, interview, marriage, without, consent, of, parents, they, do, not, make, void, but, they, mulct, it, in, the, inheritors, for, the, children, of, such, marriages, are, not, admitted, to, inherit, above, a, third, part, of, their, parents', inheritance, have, read, in, a, book, of, one, of, your, men, of, a, feigned, commonwealth, where, the, married, couple, are, permitted, before, they, contract, to, see, one, another, naked, this, they, dislike, for, they, think, it, a, scorn, to, give, a, refusal, after, so, familiar, knowledge, but, because, of, many, hidden, defects, in, men, and, women's, bodies, they, have, a, more, civil, way, for, they, have, near, every, town, a, couple, of, pools, (which, they, call, adam, and, eve's, pools, ), where, it, is, permitted, to, one, of, the, friends, of, the, men, and, another, of, the, friends, of, the, woman, to, see, them, severally, bathe, naked, and, as, we, were, thus, in, conference, there, came, one, that, seemed, to, be, a, messenger, in, a, rich, huke, that, spake, with, the, jew, whereupon, he, turned, to, me, and, said, you, will, pardon, me, for, am, commanded, away, in, haste, the, next, morning, he, came, to, me, again, joyful, as, it, seemed, and, said, there, is, word, come, to, the, governor, of, the, city, that, one, of, the, fathers, of, salomon's, house, will, be, here, this, day, seven-night, we, have, seen, none, of, them, this, dozen, years, his, coming, is, in, state, but, the, cause, of, his, coming, is, secret, will, provide, you, and, your, fellows, of, a, good, standing, to, see, his, entry, thanked, him, and, told, him, was, most, glad, of, the, news, the, day, being, come, he, made, his, entry, he, was, a, man, of, middle, stature, and, age, comely, of, person, and, had, an, aspect, as, if, he, pitied, men, he, was, clothed, in, a, robe, of, fine, black, cloth, with, wide, sleeves, and, a, cape, his, under, garment, was, of, excellent, white, linen, down, to, the, foot, girt, with, a, girdle, of, the, same, and, a, sindon, or, tippet, of, the, same, about, his, neck, he, had, gloves, that, were, curious, '', and, set, with, stone, and, shoes, of, peach-coloured, velvet, his, neck, was, bare, to, the, shoulders, his, hat, was, like, a, helmet, or, spanish, montera, and, his, locks, curled, below, it, decently, they, were, of, colour, brown, his, beard, was, cut, round, and, of, the, same, colour, with, his, hair, somewhat, lighter, he, was, carried, in, a, rich, chariot, without, wheels, litter-wise, with, two, horses, at, either, end, richly, trapped, in, blue, velvet, embroidered, and, two, footmen, on, each, side, in, the, like, attire, the, chariot, was, all, of, cedar, gilt, and, adorned, with, crystal, save, that, the, fore-end, had, panels, of, sapphires, set, in, borders, of, gold, and, the, hinder-end, the, like, of, emeralds, of, the, peru, colour, there, was, also, a, sun, of, gold, radiant, upon, the, top, in, the, midst, and, on, the, top, before, a, small, cherub, of, gold, with, wings, displayed, the, chariot, was, covered, with, cloth, of, gold, tissued, upon, blue, he, had, before, him, fifty, attendants, young, men, all, in, white, satin, loose, coats, to, the, mid, leg, and, stockings, of, white, silk, and, shoes, of, blue, velvet, and, hats, of, blue, velvet, with, fine, plumes, of, diverse, colours, set, round, like, hat-bands, next, before, the, chariot, went, two, men, bare-headed, in, linen, garments, down, the, foot, girt, and, shoes, of, blue, velvet, who, carried, the, one, a, crosier, the, other, a, pastoral, staff, like, a, sheep-hook, neither, of, them, of, metal, but, the, crosier, of, balm-wood, the, pastoral, staff, of, cedar, horsemen, he, had, none, neither, before, nor, behind, his, chariot, as, it, seemeth, to, avoid, all, tumult, and, trouble, behind, his, chariot, went, all, the, officers, and, principals, of, the, companies, of, the, city, he, sat, alone, upon, cushions, of, a, kind, of, excellent, plush, blue, and, under, his, foot, curious, carpets, of, silk, of, diverse, colours, like, the, persian, but, far, finer, he, held, up, his, bare, hand, as, he, went, as, blessing, the, people, but, in, silence, the, street, was, wonderfully, well, kept, so, that, there, was, never, any, army, had, their, men, stand, in, better, battle-array, than, the, people, stood, the, windows, likewise, were, not, crowded, but, every, one, stood, in, them, as, if, they, had, been, placed, when, the, shew, was, past, the, jew, said, to, me, shall, not, be, able, to, attend, you, as, would, in, regard, of, some, charge, the, city, hath, laid, upon, me, for, the, entertaining, of, this, great, person, three, days, after, the, jew, came, to, me, again, and, said, ye, are, happy, men, for, the, father, of, salomon's, house, taketh, knowledge, of, your, being, here, and, commanded, me, to, tell, you, that, he, will, admit, all, your, company, to, his, presence, and, have, private, conference, with, one, of, you, that, ye, shall, choose, and, for, this, hath, appointed, the, next, day, after, to-morrow, and, because, he, meaneth, to, give, you, his, blessing, he, hath, appointed, it, in, the, forenoon, we, came, at, our, day, and, hour, and, was, chosen, by, my, fellows, for, the, private, access, we, found, him, in, a, fair, chamber, richly, hanged, and, carpeted, under, foot, without, any, degrees, to, the, state, he, was, set, upon, a, low, throne, richly, adorned, and, a, rich, cloth, of, state, over, his, head, of, blue, satin, embroidered, he, was, alone, save, that, he, had, two, pages, of, honour, on, either, hand, one, finely, attired, in, white, his, under, garments, were, the, like, that, we, saw, him, wear, in, the, chariot, but, instead, of, his, gown, he, had, on, him, a, mantle, with, a, cape, of, the, same, fine, black, fastened, about, him, when, we, came, in, as, we, were, taught, we, bowed, low, at, our, first, entrance, and, when, we, were, come, near, his, chair, he, stood, up, holding, forth, his, hand, ungloved, and, in, posture, of, blessing, and, we, every, one, of, us, stooped, down, and, kissed, the, hem, of, his, tippet, that, done, the, rest, departed, and, remained, then, he, warned, the, pages, forth, of, the, room, and, caused, me, to, sit, down, beside, him, and, spake, to, me, thus, in, the, spanish, tongue, god, bless, thee, my, son, will, give, thee, the, greatest, jewel, have, for, will, impart, unto, thee, for, the, love, of, god, and, men, a, relation, of, the, true, state, of, salomon's, house, son, to, make, you, know, the, true, state, of, salomon's, house, will, keep, this, order, first, will, set, forth, unto, you, the, end, of, our, foundation, secondly, the, preparations, and, instruments, we, have, for, our, works, thirdly, the, several, employments, and, functions, whereto, our, fellows, are, assigned, and, fourthly, the, ordinances, and, rites, which, we, observe, the, end, of, our, foundation, is, the, knowledge, of, causes, and, secret, motions, of, things, and, the, enlarging, of, the, bounds, of, human, empire, to, the, effecting, of, all, things, possible, the, preparations, and, instruments, are, these, we, have, large, and, deep, caves, of, several, depths, the, deepest, are, sunk, six, hundred, fathom, and, some, of, them, are, digged, and, made, under, great, hills, and, mountains, so, that, if, you, reckon, together, the, depth, of, the, hill, and, the, depth, of, the, cave, they, are, (some, of, them), above, three, miles, deep, for, we, find, that, the, depth, of, a, hill, and, the, depth, of, a, cave, from, the, flat, is, the, same, thing, both, remote, alike, from, the, sun, and, heaven's, beams, and, from, the, open, air, these, caves, we, call, the, lower, region, and, we, use, them, for, all, coagulations, indurations, refrigerations, and, conservations, of, bodies, we, use, them, likewise, for, the, imitation, of, natural, mines, and, the, producing, also, of, new, artificial, metals, by, compositions, and, materials, which, we, use, and, lay, there, for, many, years, we, use, them, also, sometimes, (which, may, seem, strange, ), for, curing, of, some, diseases, and, for, prolongation, of, life, in, some, hermits, that, choose, to, live, there, well, accommodated, of, all, things, necessary, and, indeed, live, very, long, by, whom, also, we, learn, many, things, we, have, burials, in, several, earths, where, we, put, diverse, cements, as, the, chineses, do, their, porcellain, but, we, have, them, in, greater, variety, and, some, of, them, more, fine, we, have, also, great, variety, of, composts, and, soils, for, the, making, of, the, earth, fruitful, we, have, high, towers, the, highest, about, half, a, mile, in, height, and, some, of, them, likewise, set, upon, high, mountains, so, that, the, vantage, of, the, hill, with, the, tower, is, in, the, highest, of, them, three, miles, at, least, and, these, places, we, call, the, upper, region, accounting, the, air, between, the, high, places, and, the, low, as, a, middle, region, we, use, these, towers, according, to, their, several, heights, and, situations, for, insolation, refrigeration, conservation, and, for, the, view, of, divers, meteors, as, winds, rain, snow, hail, and, some, of, the, fiery, meteors, also, and, upon, them, in, some, places, are, dwellings, of, hermits, whom, we, visit, sometimes, and, instruct, what, to, observe, we, have, great, lakes, both, salt, and, fresh, whereof, we, have, use, for, the, fish, and, fowl, we, use, them, also, for, burials, of, some, natural, bodies, for, we, find, a, difference, in, things, buried, in, earth, or, in, air, below, the, earth, and, things, buried, in, water, we, have, also, pools, of, which, some, do, strain, fresh, water, out, of, salt, and, others, by, art, do, turn, fresh, water, into, salt, we, have, also, some, rocks, in, the, midst, of, the, sea, and, some, bays, upon, the, shore, for, some, works, wherein, is, required, the, air, and, vapor, of, the, sea, we, have, likewise, violent, streams, and, cataracts, which, serve, us, for, many, motions, and, likewise, engines, for, multiplying, and, enforcing, of, winds, to, set, also, on, going, diverse, motions, we, have, also, a, number, of, artificial, wells, and, fountains, made, in, imitation, of, the, natural, sources, and, baths, as, tincted, upon, vitriol, sulphur, steel, brass, lead, nitre, and, other, minerals, and, again, we, have, little, wells, for, infusions, of, many, things, where, the, waters, take, the, virtue, quicker, and, better, than, in, vessels, or, basins, and, amongst, them, we, have, a, water, which, we, call, water, of, paradise, being, by, that, we, do, to, it, made, very, sovereign, for, health, and, prolongation, of, life, we, have, also, great, and, spacious, houses, where, we, imitate, and, demonstrate, meteors, as, snow, hail, rain, some, artificial, rains, of, bodies, and, not, of, water, thunders, lightnings, also, generations, of, bodies, in, air, as, frogs, flies, and, divers, others, we, have, also, certain, chambers, which, we, call, chambers, of, health, where, we, qualify, the, air, as, we, think, good, and, proper, for, the, cure, of, divers, diseases, and, preservation, of, health, we, have, also, fair, and, large, baths, of, several, mixtures, for, the, cure, of, diseases, and, the, restoring, of, man's, body, from, arefaction, and, others, for, the, confirming, of, it, in, strength, of, sinewes, vital, parts, and, the, very, juice, and, substance, of, the, body, we, have, also, large, and, various, orchards, and, gardens, wherein, we, do, not, so, much, respect, beauty, as, variety, of, ground, and, soil, proper, for, divers, trees, and, herbs, and, some, very, spacious, where, trees, and, berries, are, set, whereof, we, make, divers, kinds, of, drinks, besides, the, vineyards, in, these, we, practise, likewise, all, conclusions, of, grafting, and, inoculating, as, well, of, wild-trees, as, fruit-trees, which, produceth, many, effects, and, we, make, (by, art), in, the, same, orchards, and, gardens, trees, and, flowers, to, come, earlier, or, later, than, their, seasons, and, to, come, up, and, bear, more, speedily, than, by, their, natural, course, they, do, we, make, them, also, by, art, greater, much, than, their, nature, and, their, fruit, greater, and, sweeter, and, of, differing, taste, smell, colour, and, figure, from, their, nature, and, many, of, them, we, so, order, as, they, become, of, medicinal, use, we, have, also, means, to, make, divers, plants, rise, by, mixtures, of, earths, without, seeds, and, likewise, to, make, divers, new, plants, differing, from, the, vulgar, and, to, make, one, tree, or, plant, turn, into, another, we, have, also, parks, and, enclosures, of, all, sorts, of, beasts, and, birds, which, we, use, not, only, for, view, or, rareness, but, likewise, for, dissections, and, trials, that, thereby, we, may, take, light, what, may, be, wrought, upon, the, body, of, man, wherein, we, find, many, strange, effects, as, continuing, life, in, them, though, divers, parts, which, you, account, vital, be, perished, and, taken, forth, resuscitating, of, some, that, seem, dead, in, appearance, and, the, like, we, try, also, all, poisons, and, other, medicines, upon, them, as, well, of, chirurgery, as, physic, by, art, likewise, we, make, them, greater, or, taller, than, their, kind, is, and, contrariwise, dwarf, them, and, stay, their, growth, we, make, them, more, fruitful, and, bearing, than, their, kind, is, and, contrariwise, barren, and, not, generative, also, we, make, them, differ, in, colour, shape, activity, many, ways, we, find, means, to, make, commixtures, and, copulations, of, different, kinds, which, have, produced, many, new, kinds, and, them, not, barren, as, the, general, opinion, is, we, make, a, number, of, kinds, of, serpents, worms, flies, fishes, of, putrefaction, whereof, some, are, advanced, (in, effect), to, be, perfect, creatures, like, bests, or, birds, and, have, sexes, and, do, propagate, neither, do, we, this, by, chance, but, we, know, beforehand, of, what, matter, and, commixture, what, kind, of, those, creatures, will, arise, we, have, also, particular, pools, where, we, make, trials, upon, fishes, as, we, have, said, before, of, beasts, and, birds, we, have, also, places, for, breed, and, generation, of, those, kinds, of, worms, and, flies, which, are, of, special, use, such, as, are, with, you, your, silk-worms, and, bees, will, not, hold, you, long, with, recounting, of, our, brewhouses, bake-houses, and, kitchens, where, are, made, divers, drinks, breads, and, meats, rare, and, of, special, effects, wines, we, have, of, grapes, and, drinks, of, other, juice, of, fruits, of, grains, and, of, roots, and, of, mixtures, with, honey, sugar, manna, and, fruits, dried, and, decocted, also, of, the, tears, or, woundings, of, trees, and, of, the, pulp, of, canes, and, these, drinks, are, of, several, ages, some, to, the, age, or, last, of, forty, years, we, have, drinks, also, brewed, with, several, herbs, and, roots, and, spices, yea, with, several, fleshes, and, white-meats, whereof, some, of, the, drinks, are, such, as, they, are, in, effect, meat, and, drink, both, so, that, divers, especially, in, age, do, desire, to, live, with, them, with, little, or, no, meat, or, bread, and, above, all, we, strive, to, have, drink, of, extreme, thin, parts, to, insinuate, into, the, body, and, yet, without, all, biting, sharpness, or, fretting, insomuch, as, some, of, them, put, upon, the, back, of, your, hand, will, with, a, little, stay, pass, through, to, the, palm, and, yet, taste, mild, to, the, mouth, we, have, also, waters, which, we, ripen, in, that, fashion, as, they, become, nourishing, so, that, they, are, indeed, excellent, drink, and, many, will, use, no, other, breads, we, have, of, several, grains, roots, and, kernels, yea, and, some, of, flesh, and, fish, dried, with, divers, kinds, of, leavenings, and, seasonings, so, that, some, do, extremely, move, appetites, some, do, nourish, so, as, divers, do, live, of, them, without, any, other, meat, who, live, very, long, so, for, meats, we, have, some, of, them, so, beaten, and, made, tender, and, mortified, ', yet, without, all, corrupting, as, a, weak, heat, of, the, stomach, will, turn, them, into, good, chylus, as, well, as, a, strong, heat, would, meat, otherwise, prepared, we, have, some, meats, also, and, breads, and, drinks, which, taken, by, men, enable, them, to, fast, long, after, and, some, other, that, used, make, the, very, flesh, of, men's, bodies, sensibly', more, hard, and, tough, and, their, strength, far, greater, than, otherwise, it, would, be, we, have, dispensatories, or, shops, of, medicines, wherein, you, may, easily, think, if, we, have, such, variety, of, plants, and, living, creatures, more, than, you, have, in, europe, (for, we, know, what, you, have, ), the, simples, drugs, and, ingredients, of, medicines, must, likewise, be, in, so, much, the, greater, variety, we, have, them, likewise, of, divers, ages, and, long, fermentations, and, for, their, preparations, we, have, not, only, all, manner, of, exquisite, distillations, and, separations, and, especially, by, gentle, heats, and, percolations, through, divers, strainers, yea, and, substances, but, also, exact, forms, of, composition, whereby, they, incorporate, almost, as, they, were, natural, simples, we, have, also, divers, mechanical, arts, which, you, have, not, and, stuffs, made, by, them, as, papers, linen, silks, tissues, dainty, works, of, feathers, of, wonderful, lustre, excellent, dies, and, many, others, and, shops, likewise, as, well, for, such, as, are, not, brought, into, vulgar, use, amongst, us, as, for, those, that, are, for, you, must, know, that, of, the, things, before, recited, many, of, them, are, grown, into, use, throughout, the, kingdom, but, yet, if, they, did, flow, from, our, invention, we, have, of, them, also, for, patterns, and, principals, we, have, also, furnaces, of, great, diversities, and, that, keep, great, diversity, of, heats, fierce, and, quick, strong, and, constant, soft, and, mild, blown, quiet, dry, moist, and, the, like, but, above, all, we, have, heats, in, imitation, of, the, sun's, and, heavenly, bodies', heats, that, pass, divers, inequalities, and, (as, it, were), orbs, progresses, and, returns, whereby, we, produce, admirable, effects, besides, we, have, heats, of, dungs, and, of, bellies, and, maws, of, living, creatures, and, of, their, bloods, and, bodies, and, of, hays, and, herbs, laid, up, moist, of, lime, unquenched, and, such, like, instruments, also, which, generate, heat, only, by, motion, and, farther, places, for, strong, insulations, and, again, places, under, the, earth, which, by, nature, or, art, yield, heat, these, divers, heats, we, use, as, the, nature, of, the, operation, which, we, intend, requireth, we, have, also, perspective-houses, where, we, make, demonstrations, of, all, lights, and, radiations, and, of, all, colours, and, out, of, things, uncoloured, and, transparent, we, can, represent, unto, you, all, several, colours, not, in, rain-bows, (as, it, is, in, gems, and, prisms, ), but, of, themselves, single, we, represent, also, all, multiplications, of, light, which, we, carry, to, great, distance, and, make, so, sharp, as, to, discern, small, points, and, lines, also, all, colourations, of, light, all, delusions, and, deceits, of, the, sight, in, figures, magnitudes, motions, colours, all, demonstrations, of, shadows, we, find, also, divers, means, yet, unknown, to, you, of, producing, of, light, originally, from, divers, bodies, we, procure, means, of, seeing, objects, afar, off, as, in, the, heaven, and, remote, places, and, represent, things, near, as, afar, off, and, things, afar, off, as, near, making, feigned, distances, we, have, also, helps, for, the, sight, far, above, spectacles, and, glasses, in, use, we, have, also, glasses, and, means, to, see, small, and, minute, bodies, perfectly, and, distinctly, as, the, shapes, and, colours, of, small, flies, and, worms, grains, and, flaws, in, gems, which, cannot, otherwise, be, seen, observations, in, urine, and, blood, not, otherwise, to, be, seen, we, make, artificial, rain-bows, halo's, and, circles, about, light, we, represent, also, all, manner, of, reflexions, refractions, and, multiplications, of, visual, beams, of, objects, we, have, also, precious, stones, of, all, kinds, many, of, them, of, great, beauty, and, to, you, unknown, crystals, likewise, and, glasses, of, divers, kinds, and, amongst, them, some, of, metals, vitrificated, and, other, materials, besides, those, of, which, you, make, glass, also, a, number, of, fossils, and, imperfect, minerals, which, you, have, not, likewise, loadstones, of, prodigious, virtue, and, other, rare, stones, both, natural, and, artificial, we, have, also, sound-houses, where, we, practise, and, demonstrate, all, sounds, and, their, generation, we, have, harmonies, which, you, have, not, of, quarter-sounds, and, lesser, slides, of, sounds, divers, instruments, of, music, likewise, to, you, unknown, some, sweeter, than, any, you, have, together, with, bells, and, rings, that, are, dainty, and, sweet, we, represent, small, sounds, as, great, and, deep, likewise, great, sounds, extenuate, and, sharp, we, make, divers, tremblings, and, warblings, of, sounds, which, in, their, original, are, entire, we, represent, and, imitate, all, articulate, sounds, and, letters, and, the, voices, and, notes, of, beasts, and, birds, we, have, certain, helps, which, set, to, the, ear, do, further, the, hearing, greatly, we, have, also, divers, strange, and, artificial, echoes, reflecting, the, voice, many, times, and, as, it, were, tossing, it, and, some, that, give, back, the, voice, louder, than, it, came, some, shriller, and, some, deeper, yea, some, rendering, the, voice, differing, in, the, letters, or, articulate, sound, from, that, they, receive, we, have, also, means, to, convey, sounds, in, trunks, and, pipes, in, strange, lines, and, distances, we, have, also, perfume-houses, wherewith, we, join, also, practices, of, taste, we, multiply, smells, which, may, seem, strange, we, imitate, smells, making, all, smells, to, breathe, outs, of, other, mixtures, than, those, that, give, them, we, make, divers, imitations, of, taste, likewise, so, that, they, will, deceive, any, man's, taste, and, in, this, house, we, contain, also, a, confiture-house, where, we, make, all, sweet-meats, dry, and, moist, and, divers, pleasant, wines, milks, broths, and, sallets, in, far, greater, variety, than, you, have, we, have, also, engine-houses, where, are, prepared, engines, and, instruments, for, all, sorts, of, motions, there, we, imitate, and, practise, to, make, swifter, motions, than, any, you, have, either, out, of, your, muskets, or, any, engine, that, you, have, and, to, make, them, and, multiply, them, more, easily, and, with, small, force, by, wheels, and, other, means, and, to, make, them, stronger, and, more, violent, than, yours, are, exceeding, your, greatest, cannons, and, basilisks, we, represent, also, ordnance, and, instruments, of, war, and, engines, of, all, kinds, and, likewise, new, mixtures, and, compositions, of, gun-powder, wild-fires, burning, in, water, and, unquenchable, also, fireworks, of, all, variety, both, for, pleasure, and, use, we, imitate, also, flights, of, birds, we, have, some, degrees, of, flying, in, the, air, we, have, ships, and, boats, for, going, under, water, and, brooking, of, seas, also, swimming-girdles, and, supporters, we, have, divers, curious, clocks, and, other, like, motions, of, return, and, some, perpetual, motions, we, imitate, also, motions, of, living, creatures, by, images, of, men, beasts, birds, fishes, and, serpents, we, have, also, a, great, number, of, other, various, motions, strange, for, equality, fineness, and, subtilty, we, have, also, a, mathematical, house, where, are, represented, all, instruments, as, well, of, geometry, as, astronomy, exquisitely, made, we, have, also, houses, of, deceits, of, the, senses, where, we, represent, all, manner, of, feats, of, juggling, false, apparitions, impostures, and, illusions, and, their, fallacies, and, surely, you, will, easily, believe, that, we, that, have, so, many, things, truly, natural, which, induce, admiration, could, in, a, world, of, particulars, deceive, the, senses, if, we, would, disguise, those, things, and, labour, to, make, them, seem, more, miraculous, but, we, do, hate, all, impostures, and, lies, insomuch, as, we, have, severely, forbidden, it, to, all, our, fellows, under, pain, of, ignominy, and, fines, that, they, do, not, show, any, natural, work, or, thing, adorned, or, swelling, but, only, pure, as, it, is, and, without, all, affectation, of, strangeness, these, are, (my, son), the, riches, of, salomon's, house, for, the, several, employments, and, offices, of, our, fellows, we, have, twelve, that, sail, into, foreign, countries, under, the, names, of, other, nations, (for, our, own, we, conceal), who, bring, us, the, books, and, abstracts, and, patterns, of, experiments, of, all, other, parts, these, we, call, merchants, of, light, we, have, three, that, collect, the, experiments, which, are, in, all, books, these, we, call, depredators, we, have, three, that, collect, the, experiments, of, all, mechanical, arts, and, also, of, liberal, sciences, and, also, of, practices, which, are, not, brought, into, arts, these, we, call, mystery-men, we, have, three, that, try, new, experiments, such, as, themselves, think, good, these, we, call, pioneers, or, miners, we, have, three, that, draw, the, experiments, of, the, former, four, into, titles, and, tables, to, give, the, better, light, for, the, drawing, of, observations, and, axioms, out, of, them, these, we, call, compilers, we, have, three, that, bend, themselves, looking, into, the, experiments, of, their, fellows, and, cast, about, how, to, draw, out, of, them, things, of, use, and, practise, for, man's, life, and, knowledge, as, well, for, works, as, for, plain, demonstration, of, causes, means, of, natural, divinations, and, the, easy, and, clear, discovery, of, the, virtues, and, parts, of, bodies, these, we, call, dowry-men, or, benefactors, then, after, divers, meetings, and, consults, of, our, whole, number, to, consider, of, the, former, labours, and, collections, we, have, three, that, take, care, out, of, them, to, direct, new, experiments, of, a, higher, light, more, penetrating, into, nature, than, the, former, these, we, call, lamps, we, have, three, others, that, do, execute, the, experiments, so, directed, and, report, them, these, we, call, inoculators, lastly, we, have, three, that, raise, the, former, discoveries, by, experiments, into, greater, observations, axioms, and, aphorisms, these, we, call, interpreters, of, nature, we, have, also, as, you, must, think, novices, and, apprentices, that, the, succession, of, the, former, employed, men, do, not, fail, besides, a, great, number, of, servants, and, attendants, men, and, women, and, this, we, do, also, we, have, consultations, which, of, the, inventions, and, experiences, which, we, have, discovered, shall, be, published, and, which, not, and, take, all, an, oath, of, secrecy, for, the, concealing, of, those, which, we, think, fit, to, keep, secret, though, some, of, those, we, do, reveal, sometimes, to, the, state, and, some, not, for, our, ordinances, and, rites, we, have, two, very, long, and, fair, galleries, in, one, of, these, we, place, patterns, and, samples, of, all, manner, of, the, more, rare, and, excellent, inventions, in, the, other, we, place, the, statues, of, all, principal, inventors, there, we, have, the, statue, of, your, columbus, that, discovered, the, west, indies, also, the, inventor, of, ships, your, monk, that, was, the, inventor, of, ordnance, and, of, gunpowder, the, inventor, of, music, the, inventor, of, letters, the, inventor, of, printing, the, inventor, of, observations, of, astronomy, the, inventor, of, works, in, metal, the, inventor, of, glass, the, inventor, of, silk, of, the, worm, the, inventor, of, wine, the, inventor, of, corn, and, bread, the, inventor, of, sugars, and, all, these, by, more, certain, tradition, than, you, have, then, have, we, divers, inventors, of, our, own, of, excellent, works, which, since, you, have, not, seen, it, were, too, long, to, make, descriptions, of, them, and, besides, in, the, right, understanding, of, those, descriptions, you, might, easily, err, for, upon, every, invention, of, value, we, erect, a, statue, to, the, inventor, and, give, him, a, liberal, and, honourable, reward, these, statues, are, some, of, brass, some, of, marble, and, touch-stone, some, of, cedar, and, other, special, woods, gilt, and, adorned, some, of, iron, some, of, silver, some, of, gold, we, have, certain, hymns, and, services, which, we, say, daily, of, lord, and, thanks, to, god, for, his, marvellous, works, and, forms, of, prayers, imploring, his, aid, and, blessing, for, the, illumination, of, our, labours, and, the, turning, of, them, into, good, and, holy, uses, lastly, we, have, circuits, or, visits, of, divers, principal, cities, of, the, kingdom, where, as, it, cometh, to, pass, we, do, publish, such, new, profitable, inventions, as, we, think, good, and, we, do, also, declare, natural, divinations, of, diseases, plagues, swarms-of, hurtful, creatures, scarcity, tempests, earthquakes, great, inundations, comets, temperature, of, the, year, and, divers, other, things, and, we, give, counsel, thereupon, what, the, people, shall, do, for, the, prevention, and, remedy, of, them, and, when, he, had, said, this, he, stood, up, and, as, had, been, taught, kneeled, down, and, he, laid, his, right, hand, upon, my, head, and, said, god, bless, thee, my, son, and, god, bless, this, relation, which, have, made, give, thee, leave, to, publish, it, for, the, good, of, other, nations, for, we, here, are, in, god's, bosom, a, land, unknown, and, so, he, left, me, having, assigned, a, value, of, about, two, thousand, ducats, for, a, bounty, to, me, and, my, fellows, for, they, give, great, largesses, where, they, come, upon, all, occasions, [the, rest, was, not, perfected, ], they, who, have, presumed, to, dogmatize, on, nature, as, on, some, well, investigated, subject, either, from, self-conceit, or, arrogance, and, in, the, professorial, style, have, inflicted, the, greatest, injury, on, philosophy, and, learning, for, they, have, tended, to, stifle, and, interrupt, inquiry, exactly, in, proportion, as, they, have, prevailed, in, bringing, others, to, their, opinion, and, their, own, activity, has, not, counterbalanced, the, mischief, they, have, occasioned, by, corrupting, and, destroying, that, of, others, they, again, who, have, entered, upon, a, contrary, course, and, asserted, that, nothing, whatever, can, be, known, whether, they, have, fallen, into, this, opinion, from, their, hatred, of, the, ancient, sophists, or, from, the, hesitation, of, their, minds, or, from, an, exuberance, of, learning, have, certainly, adduced, reasons, for, it, which, are, by, no, means, contemptible, they, have, not, however, derived, their, opinion, from, true, sources, and, hurried, on, by, their, zeal, and, some, affectation, have, certainly, exceeded, due, moderation, but, the, more, ancient, greeks, (whose, writings, have, perished), held, a, more, prudent, mean, between, the, arrogance, of, dogmatism, and, the, despair, of, scepticism, and, though, too, frequently, intermingling, complaints, and, indignation, at, the, difficulty, of, inquiry, and, the, obscurity, of, things, and, champing, as, it, were, the, bit, have, still, persisted, in, pressing, their, point, and, pursuing, their, intercourse, with, nature, thinking, as, it, seems, that, the, better, method, was, not, to, dispute, upon, the, very, point, of, the, possibility, of, anything, being, known, but, to, put, it, to, the, test, of, experience, yet, they, themselves, by, only, employing, the, power, of, the, understanding, have, not, adopted, a, fixed, rule, but, have, laid, their, whole, stress, upon, intense, meditation, and, a, continual, exercise, and, perpetual, agitation, of, the, mind, our, method, though, difficult, in, its, operation, is, easily, explained, it, consists, in, determining, the, degrees, of, certainty, while, we, as, it, were, restore, the, senses, to, their, former, rank, but, generally, reject, that, operation, of, the, mind, which, follows, close, upon, the, senses, and, open, and, establish, a, new, and, certain, course, for, the, mind, from, the, first, actual, perceptions, of, the, senses, themselves, this, no, doubt, was, the, view, taken, by, those, who, have, assigned, so, much, to, logic, showing, clearly, thereby, that, they, sought, some, support, for, the, mind, and, suspected, its, natural, and, spontaneous, mode, of, action, but, this, is, now, employed, too, late, as, a, remedy, when, all, is, clearly, lost, and, after, the, mind, by, the, daily, habit, and, intercourse, of, life, has, come, prepossessed, with, corrupted, doctrines, and, filled, with, the, vainest, idols, the, art, of, logic, therefore, being, (as, we, have, mentioned), too, late, a, precaution, [1], and, in, no, way, remedying, the, matter, has, tended, more, to, confirm, errors, than, to, disclose, truth, our, only, remaining, hope, and, salvation, is, to, begin, the, whole, labor, of, the, mind, again, not, leaving, it, to, itself, but, directing, it, perpetually, from, the, very, first, and, attaining, our, end, as, it, were, by, mechanical, aid, if, men, for, instance, had, attempted, mechanical, labors, with, their, hands, alone, and, without, the, power, and, aid, of, instruments, as, they, have, not, hesitated, to, carry, on, the, labors, of, their, understanding, with, the, unaided, efforts, of, their, mind, they, would, have, been, able, to, move, and, overcome, but, little, though, they, had, exerted, their, utmost, and, united, powers, and, just, to, pause, awhile, on, this, comparison, and, look, into, it, as, a, mirror, let, us, ask, if, any, obelisk, of, a, remarkable, size, were, perchance, required, to, be, moved, for, the, purpose, of, gracing, a, triumph, or, any, similar, pageant, and, men, were, to, attempt, it, with, their, bare, hands, would, not, any, sober, spectator, avow, it, to, be, an, act, of, the, greatest, madness, and, if, they, should, increase, the, number, of, workmen, and, imagine, that, they, could, thus, succeed, would, he, not, think, so, still, more, but, if, they, chose, to, make, a, selection, and, to, remove, the, weak, and, only, employ, the, strong, and, vigorous, thinking, by, this, means, at, any, rate, to, achieve, their, object, would, he, not, say, that, they, were, more, fondly, deranged, nay, if, not, content, with, this, they, were, to, determine, on, consulting, the, athletic, art, and, were, to, give, orders, for, all, to, appear, with, their, hands, arms, and, muscles, regularly, oiled, and, prepared, would, he, not, exclaim, that, they, were, taking, pains, to, rave, by, method, and, design, yet, men, are, hurried, on, with, the, same, senseless, energy, and, useless, combination, in, intellectual, matters, as, long, as, they, expect, great, results, either, from, the, number, and, agreement, or, the, excellence, and, acuteness, of, their, wits, or, even, strengthen, their, minds, with, logic, which, may, be, considered, as, an, athletic, preparation, but, yet, do, not, desist, (if, we, rightly, consider, the, matter), from, applying, their, own, understandings, merely, with, all, this, zeal, and, effort, while, nothing, is, more, clear, than, that, in, every, great, work, executed, by, the, hand, of, man, without, machines, or, implements, it, is, impossible, for, the, strength, of, individuals, to, be, increased, or, for, that, of, the, multitude, to, combine, having, premised, so, much, we, lay, down, two, points, on, which, we, would, admonish, mankind, lest, they, should, fail, to, see, or, to, observe, them, the, first, of, these, is, that, it, is, our, good, fortune, (as, we, consider, it), for, the, sake, of, extinguishing, and, removing, contradiction, and, irritation, of, mind, to, leave, the, honor, and, reverence, due, to, the, ancients, untouched, and, undiminished, so, that, we, can, perform, our, intended, work, and, yet, enjoy, the, benefit, of, our, respectful, moderation, for, if, we, should, profess, to, offer, something, better, than, the, ancients, and, yet, should, pursue, the, same, course, as, they, have, done, we, could, never, by, any, artifice, contrive, to, avoid, the, imputation, of, having, engaged, in, a, contest, or, rivalry, as, to, our, respective, wits, excellences, or, talents, which, though, neither, inadmissible, nor, new, (for, why, should, we, not, blame, and, point, out, anything, that, is, imperfectly, discovered, or, laid, down, by, them, of, our, own, right, a, right, common, to, all, ), yet, however, just, and, allowable, would, perhaps, be, scarcely, an, equal, match, on, account, of, the, disproportion, of, our, strength, but, since, our, present, plan, leads, up, to, open, an, entirely, different, course, to, the, understanding, and, one, unattempted, and, unknown, to, them, the, case, is, altered, there, is, an, end, to, party, zeal, and, we, only, take, upon, ourselves, the, character, of, a, guide, which, requires, a, moderate, share, of, authority, and, good, fortune, rather, than, talents, and, excellence, the, first, admonition, relates, to, persons, the, next, to, things, we, make, no, attempt, to, disturb, the, system, of, philosophy, that, now, prevails, or, any, other, which, may, or, will, exist, either, more, correct, or, more, complete, for, we, deny, not, that, the, received, system, of, philosophy, and, others, of, a, similar, nature, encourage, discussion, embellish, harangues, are, employed, and, are, of, service, in, the, duties, of, the, professor, and, the, affairs, of, civil, life, nay, we, openly, express, and, declare, that, the, philosophy, we, offer, will, not, be, very, useful, in, such, respects, it, is, not, obvious, nor, to, be, understood, in, a, cursory, view, nor, does, it, flatter, the, mind, in, its, preconceived, notions, nor, will, it, descend, to, the, level, of, the, generality, of, mankind, unless, by, its, advantages, and, effects, let, there, exist, then, (and, may, it, be, of, advantage, to, both), two, sources, and, two, distributions, of, learning, and, in, like, manner, two, tribes, and, as, it, were, kindred, families, of, contemplators, or, philosophers, without, any, hostility, or, alienation, between, them, but, rather, allied, and, united, by, mutual, assistance, let, there, be, in, short, one, method, of, cultivating, the, sciences, and, another, of, discovering, them, and, as, for, those, who, prefer, and, more, readily, receive, the, former, on, account, of, their, haste, or, from, motives, arising, from, their, ordinary, life, or, because, they, are, unable, from, weakness, of, mind, to, comprehend, and, embrace, the, other, (which, must, necessarily, be, the, case, with, by, far, the, greater, number), let, us, wish, that, they, may, prosper, as, they, desire, in, their, undertaking, and, attain, what, they, pursue, but, if, any, individual, desire, and, is, anxious, not, merely, to, adhere, to, and, make, use, of, present, discoveries, but, to, penetrate, still, further, and, not, to, overcome, his, adversaries, in, disputes, but, nature, by, labor, not, in, short, to, give, elegant, and, specious, opinions, but, to, know, to, a, certainty, and, demonstration, let, him, as, a, true, son, of, science, (if, such, be, his, wish), join, with, us, that, when, he, has, left, the, antechambers, of, nature, trodden, by, the, multitude, an, entrance, may, at, last, be, discovered, to, her, inner, apartments, and, in, order, to, be, better, understood, and, to, render, our, meaning, more, familiar, by, assigning, determinate, names, we, have, accustomed, ourselves, to, call, the, one, method, the, anticipation, of, the, mind, and, the, other, the, interpretation, of, nature, we, have, still, one, request, left, we, have, at, least, reflected, and, taken, pains, in, order, to, render, our, propositions, not, only, true, but, of, easy, and, familiar, access, to, men’s, minds, however, wonderfully, prepossessed, and, limited, yet, it, is, but, just, that, we, should, obtain, this, favor, from, mankind, (especially, in, so, great, a, restoration, of, learning, and, the, sciences), that, whosoever, may, be, desirous, of, forming, any, determination, upon, an, opinion, of, this, our, work, either, from, his, own, perceptions, or, the, crowd, of, authorities, or, the, forms, of, demonstrations, he, will, not, expect, to, be, able, to, do, so, in, a, cursory, manner, and, while, attending, to, other, matters, but, in, order, to, have, a, thorough, knowledge, of, the, subject, will, himself, by, degrees, attempt, the, course, which, we, describe, and, maintain, will, be, accustomed, to, the, subtilty, of, things, which, is, manifested, by, experience, and, will, correct, the, depraved, and, deeply, rooted, habits, of, his, mind, by, a, seasonable, and, as, it, were, just, hesitation, and, then, finally, (if, he, will), use, his, judgment, when, he, has, begun, to, be, master, of, himself, man, as, the, minister, and, interpreter, of, nature, does, and, understands, as, much, as, his, observations, on, the, order, of, nature, either, with, regard, to, things, or, the, mind, permit, him, and, neither, knows, nor, is, capable, of, more, the, unassisted, hand, and, the, understanding, left, to, itself, possess, but, little, power, effects, are, produced, by, the, means, of, instruments, and, helps, which, the, understanding, requires, no, less, than, the, hand, and, as, instruments, either, promote, or, regulate, the, motion, of, the, hand, so, those, that, are, applied, to, the, mind, prompt, or, protect, the, understanding, knowledge, and, human, power, are, synonymous, since, the, ignorance, of, the, cause, frustrates, the, effect, for, nature, is, only, subdued, by, submission, and, that, which, in, contemplative, philosophy, corresponds, with, the, cause, in, practical, science, becomes, the, rule, man, while, operating, can, only, apply, or, withdraw, natural, bodies, nature, internally, performs, the, rest, those, who, become, practically, versed, in, nature, are, the, mechanic, the, mathematician, the, physician, the, alchemist, and, the, _magician_, [2], but, all, (as, matters, now, stand), with, faint, efforts, and, meagre, success, it, would, be, madness, and, inconsistency, to, suppose, that, things, which, have, never, yet, been, performed, can, be, performed, without, employing, some, hitherto, untried, means, the, creations, of, the, mind, and, hand, appear, very, numerous, if, we, judge, by, books, and, manufactures, but, all, that, variety, consists, of, an, excessive, refinement, and, of, deductions, from, a, few, well, known, matters--_not, of, a, number, of, axioms_, [3], even, the, effects, already, discovered, are, due, to, chance, and, experiment, rather, than, to, the, sciences, for, our, present, sciences, are, nothing, more, than, peculiar, arrangements, of, matters, already, discovered, and, not, methods, for, discovery, or, plans, for, new, operations, the, sole, cause, and, root, of, almost, every, defect, in, the, sciences, is, this, that, while, we, falsely, admire, and, extol, the, powers, of, the, human, mind, we, do, not, search, for, its, real, helps, the, subtilty, of, nature, is, far, beyond, that, of, sense, or, of, the, understanding, so, that, the, specious, meditations, speculations, and, theories, of, mankind, are, but, a, kind, of, insanity, only, there, is, no, one, to, stand, by, and, observe, it, as, the, present, sciences, are, useless, for, the, discovery, of, effects, so, the, present, system, of, logic[4], is, useless, for, the, discovery, of, the, sciences, the, present, system, of, logic, rather, assists, in, confirming, and, rendering, inveterate, the, errors, founded, on, vulgar, notions, than, in, searching, after, truth, and, is, therefore, more, hurtful, than, useful, the, syllogism, is, not, applied, to, the, principles, of, the, sciences, and, is, of, no, avail, in, intermediate, axioms, [5], as, being, very, unequal, to, the, subtilty, of, nature, it, forces, assent, therefore, and, not, things, the, syllogism, consists, of, propositions, propositions, of, words, words, are, the, signs, of, notions, if, therefore, the, notions, (which, form, the, basis, of, the, whole), be, confused, and, carelessly, abstracted, from, things, there, is, no, solidity, in, the, superstructure, our, only, hope, then, is, in, genuine, induction, we, have, no, sound, notions, either, in, logic, or, physics, substance, quality, action, passion, and, existence, are, not, clear, notions, much, less, weight, levity, density, tenuity, moisture, dryness, generation, corruption, attraction, repulsion, element, matter, form, and, the, like, they, are, all, fantastical, and, ill-defined, the, notions, of, less, abstract, natures, as, man, dog, dove, and, the, immediate, perceptions, of, sense, as, heat, cold, white, black, do, not, deceive, us, materially, yet, even, these, are, sometimes, confused, by, the, mutability, of, matter, and, the, intermixture, of, things, all, the, rest, which, men, have, hitherto, employed, are, errors, and, improperly, abstracted, and, deduced, from, things, there, is, the, same, degree, of, licentiousness, and, error, in, forming, axioms, as, in, abstracting, notions, and, that, in, the, first, principles, which, depend, on, common, induction, still, more, is, this, the, case, in, axioms, and, inferior, propositions, derived, from, syllogisms, the, present, discoveries, in, science, are, such, as, lie, immediately, beneath, the, surface, of, common, notions, it, is, necessary, however, to, penetrate, the, more, secret, and, remote, parts, of, nature, in, order, to, abstract, both, notions, and, axioms, from, things, by, a, more, certain, and, guarded, method, there, are, and, can, exist, but, two, ways, of, investigating, and, discovering, truth, the, one, hurries, on, rapidly, from, the, senses, and, particulars, to, the, most, general, axioms, and, from, them, as, principles, and, their, supposed, indisputable, truth, derives, and, discovers, the, intermediate, axioms, this, is, the, way, now, in, use, the, other, constructs, its, axioms, from, the, senses, and, particulars, by, ascending, continually, and, gradually, till, it, finally, arrives, at, the, most, general, axioms, which, is, the, true, but, unattempted, way, the, understanding, when, left, to, itself, proceeds, by, the, same, way, as, that, which, it, would, have, adopted, under, the, guidance, of, logic, namely, the, first, for, the, mind, is, fond, of, starting, off, to, generalities, that, it, may, avoid, labor, and, after, dwelling, a, little, on, a, subject, is, fatigued, by, experiment, but, those, evils, are, augmented, by, logic, for, the, sake, of, the, ostentation, of, dispute, the, understanding, when, left, to, itself, in, a, man, of, a, steady, patient, and, reflecting, disposition, (especially, when, unimpeded, by, received, doctrines), makes, some, attempt, in, the, right, way, but, with, little, effect, since, the, understanding, undirected, and, unassisted, is, unequal, to, and, unfit, for, the, task, of, vanquishing, the, obscurity, of, things, each, of, these, two, ways, begins, from, the, senses, and, particulars, and, ends, in, the, greatest, generalities, but, they, are, immeasurably, different, for, the, one, merely, touches, cursorily, the, limits, of, experiment, and, particulars, while, the, other, runs, duly, and, regularly, through, them--the, one, from, the, very, outset, lays, down, some, abstract, and, useless, generalities, the, other, gradually, rises, to, those, principles, which, are, really, the, most, common, in, nature, [6], there, is, no, small, difference, between, the, idols, of, the, human, mind, and, the, ideas, of, the, divine, mind--that, is, to, say, between, certain, idle, dogmas, and, the, real, stamp, and, impression, of, created, objects, as, they, are, found, in, nature, axioms, determined, upon, in, argument, can, never, assist, in, the, discovery, of, new, effects, for, the, subtilty, of, nature, is, vastly, superior, to, that, of, argument, but, axioms, properly, and, regularly, abstracted, from, particulars, easily, point, out, and, define, new, particulars, and, therefore, impart, activity, to, the, sciences, the, axioms, now, in, use, are, derived, from, a, scanty, handful, as, it, were, of, experience, and, a, few, particulars, of, frequent, occurrence, whence, they, are, of, much, the, same, dimensions, or, extent, as, their, origin, and, if, any, neglected, or, unknown, instance, occurs, the, axiom, is, saved, by, some, frivolous, distinction, when, it, would, be, more, consistent, with, truth, to, amend, it, we, are, wont, for, the, sake, of, distinction, to, call, that, human, reasoning, which, we, apply, to, nature, the, anticipation, of, nature, (as, being, rash, and, premature), and, that, which, is, properly, deduced, from, things, the, interpretation, of, nature, anticipations, are, sufficiently, powerful, in, producing, unanimity, for, if, men, were, all, to, become, even, uniformly, mad, they, might, agree, tolerably, well, with, each, other, anticipations, again, will, be, assented, to, much, more, readily, than, interpretations, because, being, deduced, from, a, few, instances, and, these, principally, of, familiar, occurrence, they, immediately, hit, the, understanding, and, satisfy, the, imagination, while, on, the, contrary, interpretations, being, deduced, from, various, subjects, and, these, widely, dispersed, cannot, suddenly, strike, the, understanding, so, that, in, common, estimation, they, must, appear, difficult, and, discordant, and, almost, like, the, mysteries, of, faith, in, sciences, founded, on, opinions, and, dogmas, it, is, right, to, make, use, of, anticipations, and, logic, if, you, wish, to, force, assent, rather, than, things, if, all, the, capacities, of, all, ages, should, unite, and, combine, and, transmit, their, labors, no, great, progress, will, be, made, in, learning, by, anticipations, because, the, radical, errors, and, those, which, occur, in, the, first, process, of, the, mind, are, not, cured, by, the, excellence, of, subsequent, means, and, remedies, it, is, in, vain, to, expect, any, great, progress, in, the, sciences, by, the, superinducing, or, ingrafting, new, matters, upon, old, an, instauration, must, be, made, from, the, very, foundations, if, we, do, not, wish, to, revolve, forever, in, a, circle, making, only, some, slight, and, contemptible, progress, the, ancient, authors, and, all, others, are, left, in, undisputed, possession, of, their, honors, for, we, enter, into, no, comparison, of, capacity, or, talent, but, of, method, and, assume, the, part, of, a, guide, rather, than, of, a, critic, to, speak, plainly, no, correct, judgment, can, be, formed, either, of, our, method, or, its, discoveries, by, those, anticipations, which, are, now, in, common, use, for, it, is, not, to, be, required, of, us, to, submit, ourselves, to, the, judgment, of, the, very, method, we, ourselves, arraign, nor, is, it, an, easy, matter, to, deliver, and, explain, our, sentiments, for, those, things, which, are, in, themselves, new, can, yet, be, only, understood, from, some, analogy, to, what, is, old, alexander, borgia[7], said, of, the, expedition, of, the, french, into, italy, that, they, came, with, chalk, in, their, hands, to, mark, up, their, lodgings, and, not, with, weapons, to, force, their, passage, even, so, do, we, wish, our, philosophy, to, make, its, way, quietly, into, those, minds, that, are, fit, for, it, and, of, good, capacity, for, we, have, no, need, of, contention, where, we, differ, in, first, principles, and, in, our, very, notions, and, even, in, our, forms, of, demonstration, we, have, but, one, simple, method, of, delivering, our, sentiments, namely, we, must, bring, men, to, particulars, and, their, regular, series, and, order, and, they, must, for, a, while, renounce, their, notions, and, begin, to, form, an, acquaintance, with, things, our, method, and, that, of, the, sceptics[8], agree, in, some, respects, at, first, setting, out, but, differ, most, widely, and, are, completely, opposed, to, each, other, in, their, conclusion, for, they, roundly, assert, that, nothing, can, be, known, we, that, but, a, small, part, of, nature, can, be, known, by, the, present, method, their, next, step, however, is, to, destroy, the, authority, of, the, senses, and, understanding, while, we, invent, and, supply, them, with, assistance, the, idols, and, false, notions, which, have, already, preoccupied, the, human, understanding, and, are, deeply, rooted, in, it, not, only, so, beset, men’s, minds, that, they, become, difficult, of, access, but, even, when, access, is, obtained, will, again, meet, and, trouble, us, in, the, instauration, of, the, sciences, unless, mankind, when, forewarned, guard, themselves, with, all, possible, care, against, them, four, species, of, idols, beset, the, human, mind, [9], to, which, (for, distinction’s, sake), we, have, assigned, names, calling, the, first, idols, of, the, tribe, the, second, idols, of, the, den, the, third, idols, of, the, market, the, fourth, idols, of, the, theatre, the, formation, of, notions, and, axioms, on, the, foundation, of, true, induction, is, the, only, fitting, remedy, by, which, we, can, ward, off, and, expel, these, idols, it, is, however, of, great, service, to, point, them, out, for, the, doctrine, of, idols, bears, the, same, relation, to, the, interpretation, of, nature, as, that, of, the, confutation, of, sophisms, does, to, common, logic, [10], the, idols, of, the, tribe, are, inherent, in, human, nature, and, the, very, tribe, or, race, of, man, for, man’s, sense, is, falsely, asserted, to, be, the, standard, of, things, on, the, contrary, all, the, perceptions, both, of, the, senses, and, the, mind, bear, reference, to, man, and, not, to, the, universe, and, the, human, mind, resembles, those, uneven, mirrors, which, impart, their, own, properties, to, different, objects, from, which, rays, are, emitted, and, distort, and, disfigure, them, [11], the, idols, of, the, den, are, those, of, each, individual, for, everybody, (in, addition, to, the, errors, common, to, the, race, of, man), has, his, own, individual, den, or, cavern, which, intercepts, and, corrupts, the, light, of, nature, either, from, his, own, peculiar, and, singular, disposition, or, from, his, education, and, intercourse, with, others, or, from, his, reading, and, the, authority, acquired, by, those, whom, he, reverences, and, admires, or, from, the, different, impressions, produced, on, the, mind, as, it, happens, to, be, preoccupied, and, predisposed, or, equable, and, tranquil, and, the, like, so, that, the, spirit, of, man, (according, to, its, several, dispositions), is, variable, confused, and, as, it, were, actuated, by, chance, and, heraclitus, said, well, that, men, search, for, knowledge, in, lesser, worlds, and, not, in, the, greater, or, common, world, there, are, also, idols, formed, by, the, reciprocal, intercourse, and, society, of, man, with, man, which, we, call, idols, of, the, market, from, the, commerce, and, association, of, men, with, each, other, for, men, converse, by, means, of, language, but, words, are, formed, at, the, will, of, the, generality, and, there, arises, from, a, bad, and, unapt, formation, of, words, a, wonderful, obstruction, to, the, mind, nor, can, the, definitions, and, explanations, with, which, learned, men, are, wont, to, guard, and, protect, themselves, in, some, instances, afford, a, complete, remedy--words, still, manifestly, force, the, understanding, throw, everything, into, confusion, and, lead, mankind, into, vain, and, innumerable, controversies, and, fallacies, lastly, there, are, idols, which, have, crept, into, men’s, minds, from, the, various, dogmas, of, peculiar, systems, of, philosophy, and, also, from, the, perverted, rules, of, demonstration, and, these, we, denominate, idols, of, the, theatre, for, we, regard, all, the, systems, of, philosophy, hitherto, received, or, imagined, as, so, many, plays, brought, out, and, performed, creating, fictitious, and, theatrical, worlds, nor, do, we, speak, only, of, the, present, systems, or, of, the, philosophy, and, sects, of, the, ancients, since, numerous, other, plays, of, a, similar, nature, can, be, still, composed, and, made, to, agree, with, each, other, the, causes, of, the, most, opposite, errors, being, generally, the, same, nor, again, do, we, allude, merely, to, general, systems, but, also, to, many, elements, and, axioms, of, sciences, which, have, become, inveterate, by, tradition, implicit, credence, and, neglect, we, must, however, discuss, each, species, of, idols, more, fully, and, distinctly, in, order, to, guard, the, human, understanding, against, them, the, human, understanding, from, its, peculiar, nature, easily, supposes, a, greater, degree, of, order, and, equality, in, things, than, it, really, finds, and, although, many, things, in, nature, be, _sui, generis_, and, most, irregular, will, yet, invent, parallels, and, conjugates, and, relatives, where, no, such, thing, is, hence, the, fiction, that, all, celestial, bodies, move, in, perfect, circles, thus, rejecting, entirely, spiral, and, serpentine, lines, (except, as, explanatory, terms), [12], hence, also, the, element, of, fire, is, introduced, with, its, peculiar, orbit, [13], to, keep, square, with, those, other, three, which, are, objects, of, our, senses, the, relative, rarity, of, the, elements, (as, they, are, called), is, arbitrarily, made, to, vary, in, tenfold, progression, with, many, other, dreams, of, the, like, nature, [14], nor, is, this, folly, confined, to, theories, but, it, is, to, be, met, with, even, in, simple, notions, the, human, understanding, when, any, proposition, has, been, once, laid, down, (either, from, general, admission, and, belief, or, from, the, pleasure, it, affords), forces, everything, else, to, add, fresh, support, and, confirmation, and, although, most, cogent, and, abundant, instances, may, exist, to, the, contrary, yet, either, does, not, observe, or, despises, them, or, gets, rid, of, and, rejects, them, by, some, distinction, with, violent, and, injurious, prejudice, rather, than, sacrifice, the, authority, of, its, first, conclusions, it, was, well, answered, by, him[15], who, was, shown, in, a, temple, the, votive, tablets, suspended, by, such, as, had, escaped, the, peril, of, shipwreck, and, was, pressed, as, to, whether, he, would, then, recognize, the, power, of, the, gods, by, an, inquiry, but, where, are, the, portraits, of, those, who, have, perished, in, spite, of, their, vows, all, superstition, is, much, the, same, whether, it, be, that, of, astrology, dreams, omens, retributive, judgment, or, the, like, in, all, of, which, the, deluded, believers, observe, events, which, are, fulfilled, but, neglect, and, pass, over, their, failure, though, it, be, much, more, common, but, this, evil, insinuates, itself, still, more, craftily, in, philosophy, and, the, sciences, in, which, a, settled, maxim, vitiates, and, governs, every, other, circumstance, though, the, latter, be, much, more, worthy, of, confidence, besides, even, in, the, absence, of, that, eagerness, and, want, of, thought, (which, we, have, mentioned), it, is, the, peculiar, and, perpetual, error, of, the, human, understanding, to, be, more, moved, and, excited, by, affirmatives, than, negatives, whereas, it, ought, duly, and, regularly, to, be, impartial, nay, in, establishing, any, true, axiom, the, negative, instance, is, the, most, powerful, the, human, understanding, is, most, excited, by, that, which, strikes, and, enters, the, mind, at, once, and, suddenly, and, by, which, the, imagination, is, immediately, filled, and, inflated, it, then, begins, almost, imperceptibly, to, conceive, and, suppose, that, everything, is, similar, to, the, few, objects, which, have, taken, possession, of, the, mind, while, it, is, very, slow, and, unfit, for, the, transition, to, the, remote, and, heterogeneous, instances, by, which, axioms, are, tried, as, by, fire, unless, the, office, be, imposed, upon, it, by, severe, regulations, and, a, powerful, authority, the, human, understanding, is, active, and, cannot, halt, or, rest, but, even, though, without, effect, still, presses, forward, thus, we, cannot, conceive, of, any, end, or, external, boundary, of, the, world, and, it, seems, necessarily, to, occur, to, us, that, there, must, be, something, beyond, nor, can, we, imagine, how, eternity, has, flowed, on, down, to, the, present, day, since, the, usually, received, distinction, of, an, infinity, a, parte, ante, and, a, parte, post, [16], cannot, hold, good, for, it, would, thence, follow, that, one, infinity, is, greater, than, another, and, also, that, infinity, is, wasting, away, and, tending, to, an, end, there, is, the, same, difficulty, in, considering, the, infinite, divisibility, of, lines, arising, from, the, weakness, of, our, minds, which, weakness, interferes, to, still, greater, disadvantage, with, the, discovery, of, causes, for, although, the, greatest, generalities, in, nature, must, be, positive, just, as, they, are, found, and, in, fact, not, causable, yet, the, human, understanding, incapable, of, resting, seeks, for, something, more, intelligible, thus, however, while, aiming, at, further, progress, it, falls, back, to, what, is, actually, less, advanced, namely, final, causes, for, they, are, clearly, more, allied, to, man’s, own, nature, than, the, system, of, the, universe, and, from, this, source, they, have, wonderfully, corrupted, philosophy, but, he, would, be, an, unskilful, and, shallow, philosopher, who, should, seek, for, causes, in, the, greatest, generalities, and, not, be, anxious, to, discover, them, in, subordinate, objects, the, human, understanding, resembles, not, a, dry, light, but, admits, a, tincture, of, the, will[17], and, passions, which, generate, their, own, system, accordingly, for, man, always, believes, more, readily, that, which, he, prefers, he, therefore, rejects, difficulties, for, want, of, patience, in, investigation, sobriety, because, it, limits, his, hope, the, depths, of, nature, from, superstition, the, light, of, experiment, from, arrogance, and, pride, lest, his, mind, should, appear, to, be, occupied, with, common, and, varying, objects, paradoxes, from, a, fear, of, the, opinion, of, the, vulgar, in, short, his, feelings, imbue, and, corrupt, his, understanding, in, innumerable, and, sometimes, imperceptible, ways, but, by, far, the, greatest, impediment, and, aberration, of, the, human, understanding, proceeds, from, the, dulness, incompetence, and, errors, of, the, senses, since, whatever, strikes, the, senses, preponderates, over, everything, however, superior, which, does, not, immediately, strike, them, hence, contemplation, mostly, ceases, with, sight, and, a, very, scanty, or, perhaps, no, regard, is, paid, to, invisible, objects, the, entire, operation, therefore, of, spirits, inclosed, in, tangible, bodies[18], is, concealed, and, escapes, us, all, that, more, delicate, change, of, formation, in, the, parts, of, coarser, substances, (vulgarly, called, alteration, but, in, fact, a, change, of, position, in, the, smallest, particles), is, equally, unknown, and, yet, unless, the, two, matters, we, have, mentioned, be, explored, and, brought, to, light, no, great, effect, can, be, produced, in, nature, again, the, very, nature, of, common, air, and, all, bodies, of, less, density, (of, which, there, are, many), is, almost, unknown, for, the, senses, are, weak, and, erring, nor, can, instruments, be, of, great, use, in, extending, their, sphere, or, acuteness--all, the, better, interpretations, of, nature, are, worked, out, by, instances, and, fit, and, apt, experiments, where, the, senses, only, judge, of, the, experiment, the, experiment, of, nature, and, the, thing, itself, the, human, understanding, is, by, its, own, nature, prone, to, abstraction, and, supposes, that, which, is, fluctuating, to, be, fixed, but, it, is, better, to, dissect, than, abstract, nature, such, was, the, method, employed, by, the, school, of, democritus, [19], which, made, greater, progress, in, penetrating, nature, than, the, rest, it, is, best, to, consider, matter, its, conformation, and, the, changes, of, that, conformation, its, own, action, [20], and, the, law, of, this, action, or, motion, for, forms, are, a, mere, fiction, of, the, human, mind, unless, you, will, call, the, laws, of, action, by, that, name, [21], such, are, the, idols, of, the, tribe, which, arise, either, from, the, uniformity, of, the, constitution, of, man’s, spirit, or, its, prejudices, or, its, limited, faculties, or, restless, agitation, or, from, the, interference, of, the, passions, or, the, incompetence, of, the, senses, or, the, mode, of, their, impressions, the, idols, of, the, den, derive, their, origin, from, the, peculiar, nature, of, each, individual’s, mind, and, body, and, also, from, education, habit, and, accident, and, although, they, be, various, and, manifold, yet, we, will, treat, of, some, that, require, the, greatest, caution, and, exert, the, greatest, power, in, polluting, the, understanding, some, men, become, attached, to, particular, sciences, and, contemplations, either, from, supposing, themselves, the, authors, and, inventors, of, them, or, from, having, bestowed, the, greatest, pains, upon, such, subjects, and, thus, become, most, habituated, to, them, [22], if, men, of, this, description, apply, themselves, to, philosophy, and, contemplations, of, a, universal, nature, they, wrest, and, corrupt, them, by, their, preconceived, fancies, of, which, aristotle, affords, us, a, single, instance, who, made, his, natural, philosophy, completely, subservient, to, his, logic, and, thus, rendered, it, little, more, than, useless, and, disputatious, the, chemists, again, have, formed, a, fanciful, philosophy, with, the, most, confined, views, from, a, few, experiments, of, the, furnace, gilbert, [23], too, having, employed, himself, most, assiduously, in, the, consideration, of, the, magnet, immediately, established, a, system, of, philosophy, to, coincide, with, his, favorite, pursuit, the, greatest, and, perhaps, radical, distinction, between, different, men’s, dispositions, for, philosophy, and, the, sciences, is, this, that, some, are, more, vigorous, and, active, in, observing, the, differences, of, things, others, in, observing, their, resemblances, for, a, steady, and, acute, disposition, can, fix, its, thoughts, and, dwell, upon, and, adhere, to, a, point, through, all, the, refinements, of, differences, but, those, that, are, sublime, and, discursive, recognize, and, compare, even, the, most, delicate, and, general, resemblances, each, of, them, readily, falls, into, excess, by, catching, either, at, nice, distinctions, or, shadows, of, resemblance, some, dispositions, evince, an, unbounded, admiration, of, antiquity, others, eagerly, embrace, novelty, and, but, few, can, preserve, the, just, medium, so, as, neither, to, tear, up, what, the, ancients, have, correctly, laid, down, nor, to, despise, the, just, innovations, of, the, moderns, but, this, is, very, prejudicial, to, the, sciences, and, philosophy, and, instead, of, a, correct, judgment, we, have, but, the, factions, of, the, ancients, and, moderns, truth, is, not, to, be, sought, in, the, good, fortune, of, any, particular, conjuncture, of, time, which, is, uncertain, but, in, the, light, of, nature, and, experience, which, is, eternal, such, factions, therefore, are, to, be, abjured, and, the, understanding, must, not, allow, them, to, hurry, it, on, to, assent, the, contemplation, of, nature, and, of, bodies, in, their, individual, form, distracts, and, weakens, the, understanding, but, the, contemplation, of, nature, and, of, bodies, in, their, general, composition, and, formation, stupefies, and, relaxes, it, we, have, a, good, instance, of, this, in, the, school, of, leucippus, and, democritus, compared, with, others, for, they, applied, themselves, so, much, to, particulars, as, almost, to, neglect, the, general, structure, of, things, while, the, others, were, so, astounded, while, gazing, on, the, structure, that, they, did, not, penetrate, the, simplicity, of, nature, these, two, species, of, contemplation, must, therefore, be, interchanged, and, each, employed, in, its, turn, in, order, to, render, the, understanding, at, once, penetrating, and, capacious, and, to, avoid, the, inconveniences, we, have, mentioned, and, the, idols, that, result, from, them, let, such, therefore, be, our, precautions, in, contemplation, that, we, may, ward, off, and, expel, the, idols, of, the, den, which, mostly, owe, their, birth, either, to, some, predominant, pursuit, or, secondly, to, an, excess, in, synthesis, and, analysis, or, thirdly, to, a, party, zeal, in, favor, of, certain, ages, or, fourthly, to, the, extent, or, narrowness, of, the, subject, in, general, he, who, contemplates, nature, should, suspect, whatever, particularly, takes, and, fixes, his, understanding, and, should, use, so, much, the, more, caution, to, preserve, it, equable, and, unprejudiced, the, idols, of, the, market, are, the, most, troublesome, of, all, those, namely, which, have, entwined, themselves, round, the, understanding, from, the, associations, of, words, and, names, for, men, imagine, that, their, reason, governs, words, while, in, fact, words, react, upon, the, understanding, and, this, has, rendered, philosophy, and, the, sciences, sophistical, and, inactive, words, are, generally, formed, in, a, popular, sense, and, define, things, by, those, broad, lines, which, are, most, obvious, to, the, vulgar, mind, but, when, a, more, acute, understanding, or, more, diligent, observation, is, anxious, to, vary, those, lines, and, to, adapt, them, more, accurately, to, nature, words, oppose, it, hence, the, great, and, solemn, disputes, of, learned, men, often, terminate, in, controversies, about, words, and, names, in, regard, to, which, it, would, be, better, (imitating, the, caution, of, mathematicians), to, proceed, more, advisedly, in, the, first, instance, and, to, bring, such, disputes, to, a, regular, issue, by, definitions, such, definitions, however, cannot, remedy, the, evil, in, natural, and, material, objects, because, they, consist, themselves, of, words, and, these, words, produce, others, [24], so, that, we, must, necessarily, have, recourse, to, particular, instances, and, their, regular, series, and, arrangement, as, we, shall, mention, when, we, come, to, the, mode, and, scheme, of, determining, notions, and, axioms, the, idols, imposed, upon, the, understanding, by, words, are, of, two, kinds, they, are, either, the, names, of, things, which, have, no, existence, (for, as, some, objects, are, from, inattention, left, without, a, name, so, names, are, formed, by, fanciful, imaginations, which, are, without, an, object), or, they, are, the, names, of, actual, objects, but, confused, badly, defined, and, hastily, and, irregularly, abstracted, from, things, fortune, the, _primum, mobile_, the, planetary, orbits, [25], the, element, of, fire, and, the, like, fictions, which, owe, their, birth, to, futile, and, false, theories, are, instances, of, the, first, kind, and, this, species, of, idols, is, removed, with, greater, facility, because, it, can, be, exterminated, by, the, constant, refutation, or, the, desuetude, of, the, theories, themselves, the, others, which, are, created, by, vicious, and, unskilful, abstraction, are, intricate, and, deeply, rooted, take, some, word, for, instance, as, moist, and, let, us, examine, how, far, the, different, significations, of, this, word, are, consistent, it, will, be, found, that, the, word, moist, is, nothing, but, a, confused, sign, of, different, actions, admitted, of, no, settled, and, defined, uniformity, for, it, means, that, which, easily, diffuses, itself, over, another, body, that, which, is, indeterminable, and, cannot, be, brought, to, a, consistency, that, which, yields, easily, in, every, direction, that, which, is, easily, divided, and, dispersed, that, which, is, easily, united, and, collected, that, which, easily, flows, and, is, put, in, motion, that, which, easily, adheres, to, and, wets, another, body, that, which, is, easily, reduced, to, a, liquid, state, though, previously, solid, when, therefore, you, come, to, predicate, or, impose, this, name, in, one, sense, flame, is, moist, in, another, air, is, not, moist, in, another, fine, powder, is, moist, in, another, glass, is, moist, so, that, it, is, quite, clear, that, this, notion, is, hastily, abstracted, from, water, only, and, common, ordinary, liquors, without, any, due, verification, of, it, there, are, however, different, degrees, of, distortion, and, mistake, in, words, one, of, the, least, faulty, classes, is, that, of, the, names, of, substances, particularly, of, the, less, abstract, and, more, defined, species, (those, then, of, chalk, and, mud, are, good, of, earth, bad), words, signifying, actions, are, more, faulty, as, to, generate, to, corrupt, to, change, but, the, most, faulty, are, those, denoting, qualities, (except, the, immediate, objects, of, sense), as, heavy, light, rare, dense, yet, in, all, of, these, there, must, be, some, notions, a, little, better, than, others, in, proportion, as, a, greater, or, less, number, of, things, come, before, the, senses, the, idols, of, the, theatre, are, not, innate, nor, do, they, introduce, themselves, secretly, into, the, understanding, but, they, are, manifestly, instilled, and, cherished, by, the, fictions, of, theories, and, depraved, rules, of, demonstration, to, attempt, however, or, undertake, their, confutation, would, not, be, consistent, with, our, declarations, for, since, we, neither, agree, in, our, principles, nor, our, demonstrations, all, argument, is, out, of, the, question, and, it, is, fortunate, that, the, ancients, are, left, in, possession, of, their, honors, we, detract, nothing, from, them, seeing, our, whole, doctrine, relates, only, to, the, path, to, be, pursued, the, lame, (as, they, say), in, the, path, outstrip, the, swift, who, wander, from, it, and, it, is, clear, that, the, very, skill, and, swiftness, of, him, who, runs, not, in, the, right, direction, must, increase, his, aberration, our, method, of, discovering, the, sciences, is, such, as, to, leave, little, to, the, acuteness, and, strength, of, wit, and, indeed, rather, to, level, wit, and, intellect, for, as, in, the, drawing, of, a, straight, line, or, accurate, circle, by, the, hand, much, depends, on, its, steadiness, and, practice, but, if, a, ruler, or, compass, be, employed, there, is, little, occasion, for, either, so, it, is, with, our, method, although, however, we, enter, into, no, individual, confutations, yet, a, little, must, be, said, first, of, the, sects, and, general, divisions, of, these, species, of, theories, secondly, something, further, to, show, that, there, are, external, signs, of, their, weakness, and, lastly, we, must, consider, the, causes, of, so, great, a, misfortune, and, so, long, and, general, a, unanimity, in, error, that, we, may, thus, render, the, access, to, truth, less, difficult, and, that, the, human, understanding, may, the, more, readily, be, purified, and, brought, to, dismiss, its, idols, the, idols, of, the, theatre, or, of, theories, are, numerous, and, may, and, perhaps, will, be, still, more, so, for, unless, men’s, minds, had, been, now, occupied, for, many, ages, in, religious, and, theological, considerations, and, civil, governments, (especially, monarchies), had, been, averse, to, novelties, of, that, nature, even, in, theory, (so, that, men, must, apply, to, them, with, some, risk, and, injury, to, their, own, fortunes, and, not, only, without, reward, but, subject, to, contumely, and, envy), there, is, no, doubt, that, many, other, sects, of, philosophers, and, theorists, would, have, been, introduced, like, those, which, formerly, flourished, in, such, diversified, abundance, among, the, greeks, for, as, many, imaginary, theories, of, the, heavens, can, be, deduced, from, the, phenomena, of, the, sky, so, it, is, even, more, easy, to, found, many, dogmas, upon, the, phenomena, of, philosophy--and, the, plot, of, this, our, theatre, resembles, those, of, the, poetical, where, the, plots, which, are, invented, for, the, stage, are, more, consistent, elegant, and, pleasurable, than, those, taken, from, real, history, in, general, men, take, for, the, groundwork, of, their, philosophy, either, too, much, from, a, few, topics, or, too, little, from, many, in, either, case, their, philosophy, is, founded, on, too, narrow, a, basis, of, experiment, and, natural, history, and, decides, on, too, scanty, grounds, for, the, theoretic, philosopher, seizes, various, common, circumstances, by, experiment, without, reducing, them, to, certainty, or, examining, and, frequently, considering, them, and, relies, for, the, rest, upon, meditation, and, the, activity, of, his, wit, there, are, other, philosophers, who, have, diligently, and, accurately, attended, to, a, few, experiments, and, have, thence, presumed, to, deduce, and, invent, systems, of, philosophy, forming, everything, to, conformity, with, them, third, set, from, their, faith, and, religious, veneration, introduce, theology, and, traditions, the, absurdity, of, some, among, them, having, proceeded, so, far, as, to, seek, and, derive, the, sciences, from, spirits, and, genii, there, are, therefore, three, sources, of, error, and, three, species, of, false, philosophy, the, sophistic, empiric, and, superstitious, aristotle, affords, the, most, eminent, instance, of, the, first, for, he, corrupted, natural, philosophy, by, logic--thus, he, formed, the, world, of, categories, assigned, to, the, human, soul, the, noblest, of, substances, a, genus, determined, by, words, of, secondary, operation, treated, of, density, and, rarity, (by, which, bodies, occupy, a, greater, or, lesser, space), by, the, frigid, distinctions, of, action, and, power, asserted, that, there, was, a, peculiar, and, proper, motion, in, all, bodies, and, that, if, they, shared, in, any, other, motion, it, was, owing, to, an, external, moving, cause, and, imposed, innumerable, arbitrary, distinctions, upon, the, nature, of, things, being, everywhere, more, anxious, as, to, definitions, in, teaching, and, the, accuracy, of, the, wording, of, his, propositions, than, the, internal, truth, of, things, and, this, is, best, shown, by, a, comparison, of, his, philosophy, with, the, others, of, greatest, repute, among, the, greeks, for, the, similar, parts, of, anaxagoras, the, atoms, of, leucippus, and, democritus, the, heaven, and, earth, of, parmenides, the, discord, and, concord, of, empedocles, [26], the, resolution, of, bodies, into, the, common, nature, of, fire, and, their, condensation, according, to, heraclitus, exhibit, some, sprinkling, of, natural, philosophy, the, nature, of, things, and, experiment, while, aristotle’s, physics, are, mere, logical, terms, and, he, remodelled, the, same, subject, in, his, metaphysics, under, a, more, imposing, title, and, more, as, a, realist, than, a, nominalist, nor, is, much, stress, to, be, laid, on, his, frequent, recourse, to, experiment, in, his, books, on, animals, his, problems, and, other, treatises, for, he, had, already, decided, without, having, properly, consulted, experience, as, the, basis, of, his, decisions, and, axioms, and, after, having, so, decided, he, drags, experiment, along, as, a, captive, constrained, to, accommodate, herself, to, his, decisions, so, that, he, is, even, more, to, be, blamed, than, his, modern, followers, (of, the, scholastic, school), who, have, deserted, her, altogether, the, empiric, school, produces, dogmas, of, a, more, deformed, and, monstrous, nature, than, the, sophistic, or, theoretic, school, not, being, founded, in, the, light, of, common, notions, (which, however, poor, and, superstitious, is, yet, in, a, manner, universal, and, of, a, general, tendency), but, in, the, confined, obscurity, of, a, few, experiments, hence, this, species, of, philosophy, appears, probable, and, almost, certain, to, those, who, are, daily, practiced, in, such, experiments, and, have, thus, corrupted, their, imagination, but, incredible, and, futile, to, others, we, have, a, strong, instance, of, this, in, the, alchemists, and, their, dogmas, it, would, be, difficult, to, find, another, in, this, age, unless, perhaps, in, the, philosophy, of, gilbert, [27], we, could, not, however, neglect, to, caution, others, against, this, school, because, we, already, foresee, and, augur, that, if, men, be, hereafter, induced, by, our, exhortations, to, apply, seriously, to, experiments, (bidding, farewell, to, the, sophistic, doctrines), there, will, then, be, imminent, danger, from, empirics, owing, to, the, premature, and, forward, haste, of, the, understanding, and, its, jumping, or, flying, to, generalities, and, the, principles, of, things, we, ought, therefore, already, to, meet, the, evil, the, corruption, of, philosophy, by, the, mixing, of, it, up, with, superstition, and, theology, is, of, a, much, wider, extent, and, is, most, injurious, to, it, both, as, a, whole, and, in, parts, for, the, human, understanding, is, no, less, exposed, to, the, impressions, of, fancy, than, to, those, of, vulgar, notions, the, disputatious, and, sophistic, school, entraps, the, understanding, while, the, fanciful, bombastic, and, as, it, were, poetical, school, rather, flatters, it, there, is, a, clear, example, of, this, among, the, greeks, especially, in, pythagoras, where, however, the, superstition, is, coarse, and, overcharged, but, it, is, more, dangerous, and, refined, in, plato, and, his, school, this, evil, is, found, also, in, some, branches, of, other, systems, of, philosophy, where, it, introduces, abstracted, forms, final, and, first, causes, omitting, frequently, the, intermediate, and, the, like, against, it, we, must, use, the, greatest, caution, for, the, apotheosis, of, error, is, the, greatest, evil, of, all, and, when, folly, is, worshipped, it, is, as, it, were, a, plague, spot, upon, the, understanding, yet, some, of, the, moderns, have, indulged, this, folly, with, such, consummate, inconsiderateness, that, they, have, endeavored, to, build, a, system, of, natural, philosophy, on, the, first, chapter, of, genesis, the, book, of, job, and, other, parts, of, scripture, seeking, thus, the, dead, among, the, living, [28], and, this, folly, is, the, more, to, be, prevented, and, restrained, because, not, only, fantastical, philosophy, but, heretical, religion, spring, from, the, absurd, mixture, of, matters, divine, and, human, it, is, therefore, most, wise, soberly, to, render, unto, faith, the, things, that, are, faith’s, having, spoken, of, the, vicious, authority, of, the, systems, founded, either, on, vulgar, notions, or, on, a, few, experiments, or, on, superstition, we, must, now, consider, the, faulty, subjects, for, contemplation, especially, in, natural, philosophy, the, human, understanding, is, perverted, by, observing, the, power, of, mechanical, arts, in, which, bodies, are, very, materially, changed, by, composition, or, separation, and, is, induced, to, suppose, that, something, similar, takes, place, in, the, universal, nature, of, things, hence, the, fiction, of, elements, and, their, co-operation, in, forming, natural, bodies, [29], again, when, man, reflects, upon, the, entire, liberty, of, nature, he, meets, with, particular, species, of, things, as, animals, plants, minerals, and, is, thence, easily, led, to, imagine, that, there, exist, in, nature, certain, primary, forms, which, she, strives, to, produce, and, that, all, variation, from, them, arises, from, some, impediment, or, error, which, she, is, exposed, to, in, completing, her, work, or, from, the, collision, or, metamorphosis, of, different, species, the, first, hypothesis, has, produced, the, doctrine, of, elementary, properties, the, second, that, of, occult, properties, and, specific, powers, and, both, lead, to, trifling, courses, of, reflection, in, which, the, mind, acquiesces, and, is, thus, diverted, from, more, important, subjects, but, physicians, exercise, a, much, more, useful, labor, in, the, consideration, of, the, secondary, qualities, of, things, and, the, operations, of, attraction, repulsion, attenuation, inspissation, dilatation, astringency, separation, maturation, and, the, like, and, would, do, still, more, if, they, would, not, corrupt, these, proper, observations, by, the, two, systems, have, alluded, to, of, elementary, qualities, and, specific, powers, by, which, they, either, reduce, the, secondary, to, first, qualities, and, their, subtile, and, immeasurable, composition, or, at, any, rate, neglect, to, advance, by, greater, and, more, diligent, observation, to, the, third, and, fourth, qualities, thus, terminating, their, contemplation, prematurely, nor, are, these, powers, (or, the, like), to, be, investigated, only, among, the, medicines, for, the, human, body, but, also, in, all, changes, of, other, natural, bodies, greater, evil, arises, from, the, contemplation, and, investigation, rather, of, the, stationary, principles, of, things, from, which, than, of, the, active, by, which, things, themselves, are, created, for, the, former, only, serve, for, discussion, the, latter, for, practice, nor, is, any, value, to, be, set, on, those, common, differences, of, motion, which, are, observed, in, the, received, system, of, natural, philosophy, as, generation, corruption, augmentation, diminution, alteration, and, translation, for, this, is, their, meaning, if, a, body, unchanged, in, other, respects, is, moved, from, its, place, this, is, translation, if, the, place, and, species, be, given, but, the, quantity, changed, it, is, alteration, but, if, from, such, a, change, the, mass, and, quantity, of, the, body, do, not, continue, the, same, this, is, the, motion, of, augmentation, and, diminution, if, the, change, be, continued, so, as, to, vary, the, species, and, substance, and, transfuse, them, to, others, this, is, generation, and, corruption, all, this, is, merely, popular, and, by, no, means, penetrates, into, nature, and, these, are, but, the, measures, and, bounds, of, motion, and, not, different, species, of, it, they, merely, suggest, how, far, and, not, how, or, whence, for, they, exhibit, neither, the, affections, of, bodies, nor, the, process, of, their, parts, but, merely, establish, a, division, of, that, motion, which, coarsely, exhibits, to, the, senses, matter, in, its, varied, form, even, when, they, wish, to, point, out, something, relative, to, the, causes, of, motion, and, to, establish, a, division, of, them, they, most, absurdly, introduce, natural, and, violent, motion, which, is, also, a, popular, notion, since, every, violent, motion, is, also, in, fact, natural, that, is, to, say, the, external, efficient, puts, nature, in, action, in, a, different, manner, to, that, which, she, had, previously, employed, but, if, neglecting, these, any, one, were, for, instance, to, observe, that, there, is, in, bodies, a, tendency, of, adhesion, so, as, not, to, suffer, the, unity, of, nature, to, be, completely, separated, or, broken, and, a, _vacuum_[30], to, be, formed, or, that, they, have, a, tendency, to, return, to, their, natural, dimensions, or, tension, so, that, if, compressed, or, extended, within, or, beyond, it, they, immediately, strive, to, recover, themselves, and, resume, their, former, volume, and, extent, or, that, they, have, a, tendency, to, congregate, into, masses, with, similar, bodies--the, dense, for, instance, toward, the, circumference, of, the, earth, the, thin, and, rare, toward, that, of, the, heavens, these, and, the, like, are, true, physical, genera, of, motions, but, the, others, are, clearly, logical, and, scholastic, as, appears, plainly, from, a, comparison, of, the, two, another, considerable, evil, is, that, men, in, their, systems, and, contemplations, bestow, their, labor, upon, the, investigation, and, discussion, of, the, principles, of, things, and, the, extreme, limits, of, nature, although, all, utility, and, means, of, action, consist, in, the, intermediate, objects, hence, men, cease, not, to, abstract, nature, till, they, arrive, at, potential, and, shapeless, matter, [31], and, still, persist, in, their, dissection, till, they, arrive, at, atoms, and, yet, were, all, this, true, it, would, be, of, little, use, to, advance, man’s, estate, the, understanding, must, also, be, cautioned, against, the, intemperance, of, systems, so, far, as, regards, its, giving, or, withholding, its, assent, for, such, intemperance, appears, to, fix, and, perpetuate, idols, so, as, to, leave, no, means, of, removing, them, these, excesses, are, of, two, kinds, the, first, is, seen, in, those, who, decide, hastily, and, render, the, sciences, positive, and, dictatorial, the, other, in, those, who, have, introduced, scepticism, and, vague, unbounded, inquiry, the, former, subdues, the, latter, enervates, the, understanding, the, aristotelian, philosophy, after, destroying, other, systems, (as, the, ottomans[32], do, their, brethren), by, its, disputatious, confutations, decided, upon, everything, and, aristotle, himself, then, raises, up, questions, at, will, in, order, to, settle, them, so, that, everything, should, be, certain, and, decided, a, method, now, in, use, among, his, successors, the, school, of, plato, introduced, scepticism, first, as, it, were, in, joke, and, irony, from, their, dislike, to, protagoras, hippias, [33], and, others, who, were, ashamed, of, appearing, not, to, doubt, upon, any, subject, but, the, new, academy, dogmatized, in, their, scepticism, and, held, it, as, their, tenet, although, this, method, be, more, honest, than, arbitrary, decision, (for, its, followers, allege, that, they, by, no, means, confound, all, inquiry, like, pyrrho, and, his, disciples, but, hold, doctrines, which, they, can, follow, as, probable, though, they, cannot, maintain, them, to, be, true), yet, when, the, human, mind, has, once, despaired, of, discovering, truth, everything, begins, to, languish, hence, men, turn, aside, into, pleasant, controversies, and, discussions, and, into, a, sort, of, wandering, over, subjects, rather, than, sustain, any, rigorous, investigation, but, as, we, observed, at, first, we, are, not, to, deny, the, authority, of, the, human, senses, and, understanding, although, weak, but, rather, to, furnish, them, with, assistance, we, have, now, treated, of, each, kind, of, idols, and, their, qualities, all, of, which, must, be, abjured, and, renounced, with, firm, and, solemn, resolution, and, the, understanding, must, be, completely, freed, and, cleared, of, them, so, that, the, access, to, the, kingdom, of, man, which, is, founded, on, the, sciences, may, resemble, that, to, the, kingdom, of, heaven, where, no, admission, is, conceded, except, to, children, vicious, demonstrations, are, the, muniments, and, support, of, idols, and, those, which, we, possess, in, logic, merely, subject, and, enslave, the, world, to, human, thoughts, and, thoughts, to, words, but, demonstrations, are, in, some, manner, themselves, systems, of, philosophy, and, science, for, such, as, they, are, and, accordingly, as, they, are, regularly, or, improperly, established, such, will, be, the, resulting, systems, of, philosophy, and, contemplation, but, those, which, we, employ, in, the, whole, process, leading, from, the, senses, and, things, to, axioms, and, conclusions, are, fallacious, and, incompetent, this, process, is, fourfold, and, the, errors, are, in, equal, number, in, the, first, place, the, impressions, of, the, senses, are, erroneous, for, they, fail, and, deceive, us, we, must, supply, defects, by, substitutions, and, fallacies, by, their, correction, secondly, notions, are, improperly, abstracted, from, the, senses, and, indeterminate, and, confused, when, they, ought, to, be, the, reverse, thirdly, the, induction, that, is, employed, is, improper, for, it, determines, the, principles, of, sciences, by, simple, enumeration, [34], without, adopting, exclusions, and, resolutions, or, just, separations, of, nature, lastly, the, usual, method, of, discovery, and, proof, by, first, establishing, the, most, general, propositions, then, applying, and, proving, the, intermediate, axioms, according, to, them, is, the, parent, of, error, and, the, calamity, of, every, science, but, we, will, treat, more, fully, of, that, which, we, now, slightly, touch, upon, when, we, come, to, lay, down, the, true, way, of, interpreting, nature, after, having, gone, through, the, above, expiatory, process, and, purification, of, the, mind, but, experience, is, by, far, the, best, demonstration, provided, it, adhere, to, the, experiment, actually, made, for, if, that, experiment, be, transferred, to, other, subjects, apparently, similar, unless, with, proper, and, methodical, caution, it, becomes, fallacious, the, present, method, of, experiment, is, blind, and, stupid, hence, men, wandering, and, roaming, without, any, determined, course, and, consulting, mere, chance, are, hurried, about, to, various, points, and, advance, but, little--at, one, time, they, are, happy, at, another, their, attention, is, distracted, and, they, always, find, that, they, want, something, further, men, generally, make, their, experiments, carelessly, and, as, it, were, in, sport, making, some, little, variation, in, a, known, experiment, and, then, if, they, fail, they, become, disgusted, and, give, up, the, attempt, nay, if, they, set, to, work, more, seriously, steadily, and, assiduously, yet, they, waste, all, their, time, on, probing, some, solitary, matter, as, gilbert, on, the, magnet, and, the, alchemists, on, gold, but, such, conduct, shows, their, method, to, be, no, less, unskilful, than, mean, for, nobody, can, successfully, investigate, the, nature, of, any, object, by, considering, that, object, alone, the, inquiry, must, be, more, generally, extended, even, when, men, build, any, science, and, theory, upon, experiment, yet, they, almost, always, turn, with, premature, and, hasty, zeal, to, practice, not, merely, on, account, of, the, advantage, and, benefit, to, be, derived, from, it, but, in, order, to, seize, upon, some, security, in, a, new, undertaking, of, their, not, employing, the, remainder, of, their, labor, unprofitably, and, by, making, themselves, conspicuous, to, acquire, a, greater, name, for, their, pursuit, hence, like, atalanta, they, leave, the, course, to, pick, up, the, golden, apple, interrupting, their, speed, and, giving, up, the, victory, but, in, the, true, course, of, experiment, and, in, extending, it, to, new, effects, we, should, imitate, the, divine, foresight, and, order, for, god, on, the, first, day, only, created, light, and, assigned, a, whole, day, to, that, work, without, creating, any, material, substance, thereon, in, like, manner, we, must, first, by, every, kind, of, experiment, elicit, the, discovery, of, causes, and, true, axioms, and, seek, for, experiments, which, may, afford, light, rather, than, profit, axioms, when, rightly, investigated, and, established, prepare, us, not, for, a, limited, but, abundant, practice, and, bring, in, their, train, whole, troops, of, effects, but, we, will, treat, hereafter, of, the, ways, of, experience, which, are, not, less, beset, and, interrupted, than, those, of, judgment, having, spoken, at, present, of, common, experience, only, as, a, bad, species, of, demonstration, the, order, of, our, subject, now, requires, some, mention, of, those, external, signs, of, the, weakness, in, practice, of, the, received, systems, of, philosophy, and, contemplation[35], which, we, referred, to, above, and, of, the, causes, of, a, circumstance, at, first, sight, so, wonderful, and, incredible, for, the, knowledge, of, these, external, signs, prepares, the, way, for, assent, and, the, explanation, of, the, causes, removes, the, wonder, and, these, two, circumstances, are, of, material, use, in, extirpating, more, easily, and, gently, the, idols, from, the, understanding, the, sciences, we, possess, have, been, principally, derived, from, the, greeks, for, the, addition, of, the, roman, arabic, or, more, modern, writers, are, but, few, and, of, small, importance, and, such, as, they, are, are, founded, on, the, basis, of, greek, invention, but, the, wisdom, of, the, greeks, was, professional, and, disputatious, and, thus, most, adverse, to, the, investigation, of, truth, the, name, therefore, of, sophists, which, the, contemptuous, spirit, of, those, who, deemed, themselves, philosophers, rejected, and, transferred, to, the, rhetoricians--gorgias, [36], protagoras, hippias, polus--might, well, suit, the, whole, tribe, such, as, plato, aristotle, zeno, epicurus, theophrastus, and, their, successors--chrysippus, carneades, and, the, rest, there, was, only, this, difference, between, them--the, former, were, mercenary, vagabonds, travelling, about, to, different, states, making, a, show, of, their, wisdom, and, requiring, pay, the, latter, more, dignified, and, noble, in, possession, of, fixed, habitations, opening, schools, and, teaching, philosophy, gratuitously, both, however, (though, differing, in, other, respects), were, professorial, and, reduced, every, subject, to, controversy, establishing, and, defending, certain, sects, and, dogmas, of, philosophy, so, that, their, doctrines, were, nearly, (what, dionysius, not, unaptly, objected, to, plato), the, talk, of, idle, old, men, to, ignorant, youths, but, the, more, ancient, greeks, as, empedocles, anaxagoras, leucippus, democritus, parmenides, heraclitus, xenophanes, philolaus, and, the, rest[37], (for, omit, pythagoras, as, being, superstitious), did, not, (that, we, are, aware), open, schools, but, betook, themselves, to, the, investigation, of, truth, with, greater, silence, and, with, more, severity, and, simplicity, that, is, with, less, affectation, and, ostentation, hence, in, our, opinion, they, acted, more, advisedly, however, their, works, may, have, been, eclipsed, in, course, of, time, by, those, lighter, productions, which, better, correspond, with, and, please, the, apprehensions, and, passions, of, the, vulgar, for, time, like, a, river, [38], bears, down, to, us, that, which, is, light, and, inflated, and, sinks, that, which, is, heavy, and, solid, nor, were, even, these, more, ancient, philosophers, free, from, the, national, defect, but, inclined, too, much, to, the, ambition, and, vanity, of, forming, a, sect, and, captivating, public, opinion, and, we, must, despair, of, any, inquiry, after, truth, when, it, condescends, to, such, trifles, nor, must, we, omit, the, opinion, or, rather, prophecy, of, an, egyptian, priest, with, regard, to, the, greeks, that, they, would, forever, remain, children, without, any, antiquity, of, knowledge, or, knowledge, of, antiquity, for, they, certainly, have, this, in, common, with, children, that, they, are, prone, to, talking, and, incapable, of, generation, their, wisdom, being, loquacious, and, unproductive, of, effects, hence, the, external, signs, derived, from, the, origin, and, birthplace, of, our, present, philosophy, are, not, favorable, nor, are, those, much, better, which, can, be, deduced, from, the, character, of, the, time, and, age, than, the, former, from, that, of, the, country, and, nation, for, in, that, age, the, knowledge, both, of, time, and, of, the, world, was, confined, and, meagre, which, is, one, of, the, worst, evils, for, those, who, rely, entirely, on, experience--they, had, not, a, thousand, years, of, history, worthy, of, that, name, but, mere, fables, and, ancient, traditions, they, were, acquainted, with, but, a, small, portion, of, the, regions, and, countries, of, the, world, for, they, indiscriminately, called, all, nations, situated, far, toward, the, north, scythians, all, those, to, the, west, celts, they, knew, nothing, of, africa, but, the, nearest, part, of, ethiopia, or, of, asia, beyond, the, ganges, and, had, not, even, heard, any, sure, and, clear, tradition, of, the, regions, of, the, new, world, besides, a, vast, number, of, climates, and, zones, in, which, innumerable, nations, live, and, breathe, were, pronounced, by, them, to, be, uninhabitable, nay, the, travels, of, democritus, plato, and, pythagoras, which, were, not, extensive, but, rather, mere, excursions, from, home, were, considered, as, something, vast, but, in, our, times, many, parts, of, the, new, world, and, every, extremity, of, the, old, are, well, known, and, the, mass, of, experiments, has, been, infinitely, increased, wherefore, if, external, signs, were, to, be, taken, from, the, time, of, the, nativity, or, procreation, (as, in, astrology), nothing, extraordinary, could, be, predicted, of, these, early, systems, of, philosophy, of, all, signs, there, is, none, more, certain, or, worthy, than, that, of, the, fruits, produced, for, the, fruits, and, effects, are, the, sureties, and, vouchers, as, it, were, for, the, truth, of, philosophy, now, from, the, systems, of, the, greeks, and, their, subordinate, divisions, in, particular, branches, of, the, sciences, during, so, long, a, period, scarcely, one, single, experiment, can, be, culled, that, has, a, tendency, to, elevate, or, assist, mankind, and, can, be, fairly, set, down, to, the, speculations, and, doctrines, of, their, philosophy, celsus, candidly, and, wisely, confesses, as, much, when, he, observes, that, experiments, were, first, discovered, in, medicine, and, that, men, afterward, built, their, philosophical, systems, upon, them, and, searched, for, and, assigned, causes, instead, of, the, inverse, method, of, discovering, and, deriving, experiments, from, philosophy, and, the, knowledge, of, causes, it, is, not, therefore, wonderful, that, the, egyptians, (who, bestowed, divinity, and, sacred, honors, on, the, authors, of, new, inventions), should, have, consecrated, more, images, of, brutes, than, of, men, for, the, brutes, by, their, natural, instinct, made, many, discoveries, while, men, derived, but, few, from, discussion, and, the, conclusions, of, reason, the, industry, of, the, alchemists, has, produced, some, effect, by, chance, however, and, casualty, or, from, varying, their, experiments, (as, mechanics, also, do), and, not, from, any, regular, art, or, theory, the, theory, they, have, imagined, rather, tending, to, disturb, than, to, assist, experiment, those, too, who, have, occupied, themselves, with, natural, magic, (as, they, term, it), have, made, but, few, discoveries, and, those, of, small, import, and, bordering, on, imposture, for, which, reason, in, the, same, manner, as, we, are, cautioned, by, religion, to, show, our, faith, by, our, works, we, may, very, properly, apply, the, principle, to, philosophy, and, judge, of, it, by, its, works, accounting, that, to, be, futile, which, is, unproductive, and, still, more, so, if, instead, of, grapes, and, olives, it, yield, but, the, thistle, and, thorns, of, dispute, and, contention, other, signs, may, be, selected, from, the, increase, and, progress, of, particular, systems, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, for, those, which, are, founded, on, nature, grow, and, increase, while, those, which, are, founded, on, opinion, change, and, increase, not, if, therefore, the, theories, we, have, mentioned, were, not, like, plants, torn, up, by, the, roots, but, grew, in, the, womb, of, nature, and, were, nourished, by, her, that, which, for, the, last, two, thousand, years, has, taken, place, would, never, have, happened, namely, that, the, sciences, still, continue, in, their, beaten, track, and, nearly, stationary, without, having, received, any, important, increase, nay, having, on, the, contrary, rather, bloomed, under, the, hands, of, their, first, author, and, then, faded, away, but, we, see, that, the, case, is, reversed, in, the, mechanical, arts, which, are, founded, on, nature, and, the, light, of, experience, for, they, (as, long, as, they, are, popular), seem, full, of, life, and, uninterruptedly, thrive, and, grow, being, at, first, rude, then, convenient, lastly, polished, and, perpetually, improved, there, is, yet, another, sign, (if, such, it, may, be, termed, being, rather, an, evidence, and, one, of, the, strongest, nature), namely, the, actual, confession, of, those, very, authorities, whom, men, now, follow, for, even, they, who, decide, on, things, so, daringly, yet, at, times, when, they, reflect, betake, themselves, to, complaints, about, the, subtilty, of, nature, the, obscurity, of, things, and, the, weakness, of, man’s, wit, if, they, would, merely, do, this, they, might, perhaps, deter, those, who, are, of, a, timid, disposition, from, further, inquiry, but, would, excite, and, stimulate, those, of, a, more, active, and, confident, turn, to, further, advances, they, are, not, however, satisfied, with, confessing, so, much, of, themselves, but, consider, everything, which, has, been, either, unknown, or, unattempted, by, themselves, or, their, teachers, as, beyond, the, limits, of, possibility, and, thus, with, most, consummate, pride, and, envy, convert, the, defects, of, their, own, discoveries, into, a, calumny, on, nature, and, a, source, of, despair, to, every, one, else, hence, arose, the, new, academy, which, openly, professed, scepticism, [39], and, consigned, mankind, to, eternal, darkness, hence, the, notion, that, forms, or, the, true, differences, of, things, (which, are, in, fact, the, laws, of, simple, action), are, beyond, man’s, reach, and, cannot, possibly, be, discovered, hence, those, notions, in, the, active, and, operative, branches, that, the, heat, of, the, sun, and, of, fire, are, totally, different, so, as, to, prevent, men, from, supposing, that, they, can, elicit, or, form, by, means, of, fire, anything, similar, to, the, operations, of, nature, and, again, that, composition, only, is, the, work, of, man, and, mixture, of, nature, so, as, to, prevent, men, from, expecting, the, generation, or, transformation, of, natural, bodies, by, art, men, will, therefore, easily, allow, themselves, to, be, persuaded, by, this, sign, not, to, engage, their, fortunes, and, labor, in, speculations, which, are, not, only, desperate, but, actually, devoted, to, desperation, nor, should, we, omit, the, sign, afforded, by, the, great, dissension, formerly, prevalent, among, philosophers, and, the, variety, of, schools, which, sufficiently, show, that, the, way, was, not, well, prepared, that, leads, from, the, senses, to, the, understanding, since, the, same, groundwork, of, philosophy, (namely, the, nature, of, things), was, torn, and, divided, into, such, widely, differing, and, multifarious, errors, and, although, in, these, days, the, dissensions, and, differences, of, opinions, with, regard, to, first, principles, and, entire, systems, are, nearly, extinct, [40], yet, there, remain, innumerable, questions, and, controversies, with, regard, to, particular, branches, of, philosophy, so, that, it, is, manifest, that, there, is, nothing, sure, or, sound, either, in, the, systems, themselves, or, in, the, methods, of, demonstration, [41], with, regard, to, the, supposition, that, there, is, a, general, unanimity, as, to, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, because, the, other, systems, of, the, ancients, ceased, and, became, obsolete, on, its, promulgation, and, nothing, better, has, been, since, discovered, whence, it, appears, that, it, is, so, well, determined, and, founded, as, to, have, united, the, suffrages, of, both, ages, we, will, observe--1st, that, the, notion, of, other, ancient, systems, having, ceased, after, the, publication, of, the, works, of, aristotle, is, false, for, the, works, of, the, ancient, philosophers, subsisted, long, after, that, event, even, to, the, time, of, cicero, and, the, subsequent, ages, but, at, a, later, period, when, human, learning, had, as, it, were, been, wrecked, in, the, inundation, of, barbarians, into, the, roman, empire, then, the, systems, of, aristotle, and, plato, were, preserved, in, the, waves, of, ages, like, planks, of, a, lighter, and, less, solid, nature, 2d, the, notion, of, unanimity, on, a, clear, inspection, is, found, to, be, fallacious, for, true, unanimity, is, that, which, proceeds, from, a, free, judgment, arriving, at, the, same, conclusion, after, an, investigation, of, the, fact, now, by, far, the, greater, number, of, those, who, have, assented, to, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, have, bound, themselves, down, to, it, from, prejudice, and, the, authority, of, others, so, that, it, is, rather, obsequiousness, and, concurrence, than, unanimity, but, even, if, it, were, real, and, extensive, unanimity, so, far, from, being, esteemed, a, true, and, solid, confirmation, it, should, even, lead, to, a, violent, presumption, to, the, contrary, for, there, is, no, worse, augury, in, intellectual, matters, than, that, derived, from, unanimity, with, the, exception, of, divinity, and, politics, where, suffrages, are, allowed, to, decide, for, nothing, pleases, the, multitude, unless, it, strike, the, imagination, or, bind, down, the, understanding, as, we, have, observed, above, with, the, shackles, of, vulgar, notions, hence, we, may, well, transfer, phocion’s, remark, from, morals, to, the, intellect, “that, men, should, immediately, examine, what, error, or, fault, they, have, committed, when, the, multitude, concurs, with, and, applauds, them, ”[42], this, then, is, one, of, the, most, unfavorable, signs, all, the, signs, therefore, of, the, truth, and, soundness, of, the, received, systems, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, are, unpropitious, whether, taken, from, their, origin, their, fruits, their, progress, the, confessions, of, their, authors, or, from, unanimity, we, now, come, to, the, causes, of, errors, [43], and, of, such, perseverance, in, them, for, ages, these, are, sufficiently, numerous, and, powerful, to, remove, all, wonder, that, what, we, now, offer, should, have, so, long, been, concealed, from, and, have, escaped, the, notice, of, mankind, and, to, render, it, more, worthy, of, astonishment, that, it, should, even, now, have, entered, any, one’s, mind, or, become, the, subject, of, his, thoughts, and, that, it, should, have, done, so, we, consider, rather, the, gift, of, fortune, than, of, any, extraordinary, talent, and, as, the, offspring, of, time, rather, than, wit, but, in, the, first, place, the, number, of, ages, is, reduced, to, very, narrow, limits, on, a, proper, consideration, of, the, matter, for, out, of, twenty-five[44], centuries, with, which, the, memory, and, learning, of, man, are, conversant, scarcely, six, can, be, set, apart, and, selected, as, fertile, in, science, and, favorable, to, its, progress, for, there, are, deserts, and, wastes, in, times, as, in, countries, and, we, can, only, reckon, up, three, revolutions, and, epochs, of, philosophy, 1, the, greek, 2, the, roman, our, own, that, is, the, philosophy, of, the, western, nations, of, europe, and, scarcely, two, centuries, can, with, justice, be, assigned, to, each, the, intermediate, ages, of, the, world, were, unfortunate, both, in, the, quantity, and, richness, of, the, sciences, produced, nor, need, we, mention, the, arabs, or, the, scholastic, philosophy, which, in, those, ages, ground, down, the, sciences, by, their, numerous, treatises, more, than, they, increased, their, weight, the, first, cause, then, of, such, insignificant, progress, in, the, sciences, is, rightly, referred, to, the, small, proportion, of, time, which, has, been, favorable, thereto, second, cause, offers, itself, which, is, certainly, of, the, greatest, importance, namely, that, in, those, very, ages, in, which, men’s, wit, and, literature, flourished, considerably, or, even, moderately, but, a, small, part, of, their, industry, was, bestowed, on, natural, philosophy, the, great, mother, of, the, sciences, for, every, art, and, science, torn, from, this, root, may, perhaps, be, polished, and, put, into, a, serviceable, shape, but, can, admit, of, little, growth, it, is, well, known, that, after, the, christian, religion, had, been, acknowledged, and, arrived, at, maturity, by, far, the, best, wits, were, busied, upon, theology, where, the, highest, rewards, offered, themselves, and, every, species, of, assistance, was, abundantly, supplied, and, the, study, of, which, was, the, principal, occupation, of, the, western, european, nations, during, the, third, epoch, the, rather, because, literature, flourished, about, the, very, time, when, controversies, concerning, religion, first, began, to, bud, forth, 2, in, the, preceding, ages, during, the, second, epoch, (that, of, the, romans), philosophical, meditation, and, labor, was, chiefly, occupied, and, wasted, in, moral, philosophy, (the, theology, of, the, heathens), besides, the, greatest, minds, in, these, times, applied, themselves, to, civil, affairs, on, account, of, the, magnitude, of, the, roman, empire, which, required, the, labor, of, many, 3, the, age, during, which, natural, philosophy, appeared, principally, to, flourish, among, the, greeks, was, but, a, short, period, since, in, the, more, ancient, times, the, seven, sages, (with, the, exception, of, thales), applied, themselves, to, moral, philosophy, and, politics, and, at, a, later, period, after, socrates, had, brought, down, philosophy, from, heaven, to, earth, moral, philosophy, became, more, prevalent, and, diverted, men’s, attention, from, natural, nay, the, very, period, during, which, physical, inquiries, flourished, was, corrupted, and, rendered, useless, by, contradictions, and, the, ambition, of, new, opinions, since, therefore, during, these, three, epochs, natural, philosophy, has, been, materially, neglected, or, impeded, it, is, not, at, all, surprising, that, men, should, have, made, but, little, progress, in, it, seeing, they, were, attending, to, an, entirely, different, matter, add, to, this, that, natural, philosophy, especially, of, late, has, seldom, gained, exclusive, possession, of, an, individual, free, from, all, other, pursuits, even, among, those, who, have, applied, themselves, to, it, unless, there, may, be, an, example, or, two, of, some, monk, studying, in, his, cell, or, some, nobleman, in, his, villa, [45], she, has, rather, been, made, a, passage, and, bridge, to, other, pursuits, thus, has, this, great, mother, of, the, sciences, been, degraded, most, unworthily, to, the, situation, of, a, handmaid, and, made, to, wait, upon, medicine, or, mathematical, operations, and, to, wash, the, immature, minds, of, youth, and, imbue, them, with, a, first, dye, that, they, may, afterward, be, more, ready, to, receive, and, retain, another, in, the, meantime, let, no, one, expect, any, great, progress, in, the, sciences, (especially, their, operative, part), unless, natural, philosophy, be, applied, to, particular, sciences, and, particular, sciences, again, referred, back, to, natural, philosophy, for, want, of, this, astronomy, optics, music, many, mechanical, arts, medicine, itself, and, (what, perhaps, is, more, wonderful), moral, and, political, philosophy, and, the, logical, sciences, have, no, depth, but, only, glide, over, the, surface, and, variety, of, things, because, these, sciences, when, they, have, been, once, partitioned, out, and, established, are, no, longer, nourished, by, natural, philosophy, which, would, have, imparted, fresh, vigor, and, growth, to, them, from, the, sources, and, genuine, contemplation, of, motion, rays, sounds, texture, and, conformation, of, bodies, and, the, affections, and, capacity, of, the, understanding, but, we, can, little, wonder, that, the, sciences, grow, not, when, separated, from, their, roots, there, is, another, powerful, and, great, cause, of, the, little, advancement, of, the, sciences, which, is, this, it, is, impossible, to, advance, properly, in, the, course, when, the, goal, is, not, properly, fixed, but, the, real, and, legitimate, goal, of, the, sciences, is, the, endowment, of, human, life, with, new, inventions, and, riches, the, great, crowd, of, teachers, know, nothing, of, this, but, consist, of, dictatorial, hirelings, unless, it, so, happen, that, some, artisan, of, an, acute, genius, and, ambitious, of, fame, gives, up, his, time, to, a, new, discovery, which, is, generally, attended, with, a, loss, of, property, the, majority, so, far, from, proposing, to, themselves, the, augmentation, of, the, mass, of, arts, and, sciences, make, no, other, use, of, an, inquiry, into, the, mass, already, before, them, than, is, afforded, by, the, conversion, of, it, to, some, use, in, their, lectures, or, to, gain, or, to, the, acquirement, of, a, name, and, the, like, but, if, one, out, of, the, multitude, be, found, who, courts, science, from, real, zeal, and, on, his, own, account, even, he, will, be, seen, rather, to, follow, contemplation, and, the, variety, of, theories, than, a, severe, and, strict, investigation, of, truth, again, if, there, even, be, an, unusually, strict, investigator, of, truth, yet, will, he, propose, to, himself, as, the, test, of, truth, the, satisfaction, of, his, mind, and, understanding, as, to, the, causes, of, things, long, since, known, and, not, such, a, test, as, to, lead, to, some, new, earnest, of, effects, and, a, new, light, in, axioms, if, therefore, no, one, have, laid, down, the, real, end, of, science, we, cannot, wonder, that, there, should, be, error, in, points, subordinate, to, that, end, but, in, like, manner, as, the, end, and, goal, of, science, is, ill, defined, so, even, were, the, case, otherwise, men, have, chosen, an, erroneous, and, impassable, direction, for, it, is, sufficient, to, astonish, any, reflecting, mind, that, nobody, should, have, cared, or, wished, to, open, and, complete, a, way, for, the, understanding, setting, off, from, the, senses, and, regular, well-conducted, experiment, but, that, everything, has, been, abandoned, either, to, the, mists, of, tradition, the, whirl, and, confusion, of, argument, or, the, waves, and, mazes, of, chance, and, desultory, ill-combined, experiment, now, let, any, one, but, consider, soberly, and, diligently, the, nature, of, the, path, men, have, been, accustomed, to, pursue, in, the, investigation, and, discovery, of, any, matter, and, he, will, doubtless, first, observe, the, rude, and, inartificial, manner, of, discovery, most, familiar, to, mankind, which, is, no, other, than, this, when, any, one, prepares, himself, for, discovery, he, first, inquires, and, obtains, a, full, account, of, all, that, has, been, said, on, the, subject, by, others, then, adds, his, own, reflections, and, stirs, up, and, as, it, were, invokes, his, own, spirit, after, much, mental, labor, to, disclose, its, oracles, all, which, is, a, method, without, foundation, and, merely, turns, on, opinion, another, perhaps, calls, in, logic, to, assist, him, in, discovery, which, bears, only, a, nominal, relation, to, his, purpose, for, the, discoveries, of, logic, are, not, discoveries, of, principles, and, leading, axioms, but, only, of, what, appears, to, accord, with, them, [46], and, when, men, become, curious, and, importunate, and, give, trouble, interrupting, her, about, her, proofs, and, the, discovery, of, principles, or, first, axioms, she, puts, them, off, with, her, usual, answer, referring, them, to, faith, and, ordering, them, to, swear, allegiance, to, each, art, in, its, own, department, there, remains, but, mere, experience, which, when, it, offers, itself, is, called, chance, when, it, is, sought, after, experiment, [47], but, this, kind, of, experience, is, nothing, but, a, loose, fagot, and, mere, groping, in, the, dark, as, men, at, night, try, all, means, of, discovering, the, right, road, while, it, would, be, better, and, more, prudent, either, to, wait, for, day, or, procure, a, light, and, then, proceed, on, the, contrary, the, real, order, of, experience, begins, by, setting, up, a, light, and, then, shows, the, road, by, it, commencing, with, a, regulated, and, digested, not, a, misplaced, and, vague, course, of, experiment, and, thence, deducing, axioms, and, from, those, axioms, new, experiments, for, not, even, the, divine, word, proceeded, to, operate, on, the, general, mass, of, things, without, due, order, let, men, therefore, cease, to, wonder, if, the, whole, course, of, science, be, not, run, when, all, have, wandered, from, the, path, quitting, it, entirely, and, deserting, experience, or, involving, themselves, in, its, mazes, and, wandering, about, while, a, regularly, combined, system, would, lead, them, in, a, sure, track, through, its, wilds, to, the, open, day, of, axioms, the, evil, however, has, been, wonderfully, increased, by, an, opinion, or, inveterate, conceit, which, is, both, vainglorious, and, prejudicial, namely, that, the, dignity, of, the, human, mind, is, lowered, by, long, and, frequent, intercourse, with, experiments, and, particulars, which, are, the, objects, of, sense, and, confined, to, matter, especially, since, such, matters, generally, require, labor, in, investigation, are, mean, subjects, for, meditation, harsh, in, discourse, unproductive, in, practice, infinite, in, number, and, delicate, in, their, subtilty, hence, we, have, seen, the, true, path, not, only, deserted, but, intercepted, and, blocked, up, experience, being, rejected, with, disgust, and, not, merely, neglected, or, improperly, applied, again, the, reverence, for, antiquity, [48], and, the, authority, of, men, who, have, been, esteemed, great, in, philosophy, and, general, unanimity, have, retarded, men, from, advancing, in, science, and, almost, enchanted, them, as, to, unanimity, we, have, spoken, of, it, above, the, opinion, which, men, cherish, of, antiquity, is, altogether, idle, and, scarcely, accords, with, the, term, for, the, old, age, and, increasing, years, of, the, world, should, in, reality, be, considered, as, antiquity, and, this, is, rather, the, character, of, our, own, times, than, of, the, less, advanced, age, of, the, world, in, those, of, the, ancients, for, the, latter, with, respect, to, ourselves, are, ancient, and, elder, with, respect, to, the, world, modern, and, younger, and, as, we, expect, a, greater, knowledge, of, human, affairs, and, more, mature, judgment, from, an, old, man, than, from, a, youth, on, account, of, his, experience, and, the, variety, and, number, of, things, he, has, seen, heard, and, meditated, upon, so, we, have, reason, to, expect, much, greater, things, of, our, own, age, (if, it, knew, but, its, strength, and, would, essay, and, exert, it), than, from, antiquity, since, the, world, has, grown, older, and, its, stock, has, been, increased, and, accumulated, with, an, infinite, number, of, experiments, and, observations, we, must, also, take, into, our, consideration, that, many, objects, in, nature, fit, to, throw, light, upon, philosophy, have, been, exposed, to, our, view, and, discovered, by, means, of, long, voyages, and, travels, in, which, our, times, have, abounded, it, would, indeed, be, dishonorable, to, mankind, if, the, regions, of, the, material, globe, the, earth, the, sea, and, stars, should, be, so, prodigiously, developed, and, illustrated, in, our, age, and, yet, the, boundaries, of, the, intellectual, globe, should, be, confined, to, the, narrow, discoveries, of, the, ancients, with, regard, to, authority, it, is, the, greatest, weakness, to, attribute, infinite, credit, to, particular, authors, and, to, refuse, his, own, prerogative, to, time, the, author, of, all, authors, and, therefore, of, all, authority, for, truth, is, rightly, named, the, daughter, of, time, not, of, authority, it, is, not, wonderful, therefore, if, the, bonds, of, antiquity, authority, and, unanimity, have, so, enchained, the, power, of, man, that, he, is, unable, (as, if, bewitched), to, become, familiar, with, things, themselves, nor, is, it, only, the, admiration, of, antiquity, authority, and, unanimity, that, has, forced, man’s, industry, to, rest, satisfied, with, present, discoveries, but, also, the, admiration, of, the, effects, already, placed, within, his, power, for, whoever, passes, in, review, the, variety, of, subjects, and, the, beautiful, apparatus, collected, and, introduced, by, the, mechanical, arts, for, the, service, of, mankind, will, certainly, be, rather, inclined, to, admire, our, wealth, than, to, perceive, our, poverty, not, considering, that, the, observations, of, man, and, operations, of, nature, (which, are, the, souls, and, first, movers, of, that, variety), are, few, and, not, of, deep, research, the, rest, must, be, attributed, merely, to, man’s, patience, and, the, delicate, and, well-regulated, motion, of, the, hand, or, of, instruments, to, take, an, instance, the, manufacture, of, clocks, is, delicate, and, accurate, and, appears, to, imitate, the, heavenly, bodies, in, its, wheels, and, the, pulse, of, animals, in, its, regular, oscillation, yet, it, only, depends, upon, one, or, two, axioms, of, nature, again, if, one, consider, the, refinement, of, the, liberal, arts, or, even, that, exhibited, in, the, preparation, of, natural, bodies, in, mechanical, arts, and, the, like, as, the, discovery, of, the, heavenly, motions, in, astronomy, of, harmony, in, music, of, the, letters, of, the, alphabet[49], (still, unadopted, by, the, chinese), in, grammar, or, again, in, mechanical, operations, the, productions, of, bacchus, and, ceres, that, is, the, preparation, of, wine, and, beer, the, making, of, bread, or, even, the, luxuries, of, the, table, distillation, and, the, like, if, one, reflect, also, and, consider, for, how, long, a, period, of, ages, (for, all, the, above, except, distillation, are, ancient), these, things, have, been, brought, to, their, present, state, of, perfection, and, (as, we, instanced, in, clocks), to, how, few, observations, and, axioms, of, nature, they, may, be, referred, and, how, easily, and, as, it, were, by, obvious, chance, or, contemplation, they, might, be, discovered, one, would, soon, cease, to, admire, and, rather, pity, the, human, lot, on, account, of, its, vast, want, and, dearth, of, things, and, discoveries, for, so, many, ages, yet, even, the, discoveries, we, have, mentioned, were, more, ancient, than, philosophy, and, the, intellectual, arts, so, that, (to, say, the, truth), when, contemplation, and, doctrinal, science, began, the, discovery, of, useful, works, ceased, but, if, any, one, turn, from, the, manufactories, to, libraries, and, be, inclined, to, admire, the, immense, variety, of, books, offered, to, our, view, let, him, but, examine, and, diligently, inspect, the, matter, and, contents, of, these, books, and, his, astonishment, will, certainly, change, its, object, for, when, he, finds, no, end, of, repetitions, and, how, much, men, do, and, speak, the, same, thing, over, again, he, will, pass, from, admiration, of, this, variety, to, astonishment, at, the, poverty, and, scarcity, of, matter, which, has, hitherto, possessed, and, filled, men’s, minds, but, if, any, one, should, condescend, to, consider, such, sciences, as, are, deemed, rather, curious, than, sound, and, take, a, full, view, of, the, operations, of, the, alchemists, or, magii, he, will, perhaps, hesitate, whether, he, ought, rather, to, laugh, or, to, weep, for, the, alchemist, cherishes, eternal, hope, and, when, his, labors, succeed, not, accuses, his, own, mistakes, deeming, in, his, self-accusation, that, he, has, not, properly, understood, the, words, of, art, or, of, his, authors, upon, which, he, listens, to, tradition, and, vague, whispers, or, imagines, there, is, some, slight, unsteadiness, in, the, minute, details, of, his, practice, and, then, has, recourse, to, an, endless, repetition, of, experiments, and, in, the, meantime, when, in, his, casual, experiments, he, falls, upon, something, in, appearance, new, or, of, some, degree, of, utility, he, consoles, himself, with, such, an, earnest, and, ostentatiously, publishes, them, keeping, up, his, hope, of, the, final, result, nor, can, it, be, denied, that, the, alchemists, have, made, several, discoveries, and, presented, mankind, with, useful, inventions, but, we, may, well, apply, to, them, the, fable, of, the, old, man, who, bequeathed, to, his, sons, some, gold, buried, in, his, garden, pretending, not, to, know, the, exact, spot, whereupon, they, worked, diligently, in, digging, the, vineyard, and, though, they, found, no, gold, the, vintage, was, rendered, more, abundant, by, their, labor, the, followers, of, natural, magic, who, explain, everything, by, sympathy, and, antipathy, have, assigned, false, powers, and, marvellous, operations, to, things, by, gratuitous, and, idle, conjectures, and, if, they, have, ever, produced, any, effects, they, are, rather, wonderful, and, novel, than, of, any, real, benefit, or, utility, in, superstitious, magic, (if, we, say, anything, at, all, about, it), we, must, chiefly, observe, that, there, are, only, some, peculiar, and, definite, objects, with, which, the, curious, and, superstitious, arts, have, in, every, nation, and, age, and, even, under, every, religion, been, able, to, exercise, and, amuse, themselves, let, us, therefore, pass, them, over, in, the, meantime, we, cannot, wonder, that, the, false, notion, of, plenty, should, have, occasioned, want, the, admiration, of, mankind, with, regard, to, the, arts, and, sciences, which, is, of, itself, sufficiently, simple, and, almost, puerile, has, been, increased, by, the, craft, and, artifices, of, those, who, have, treated, the, sciences, and, delivered, them, down, to, posterity, for, they, propose, and, produce, them, to, our, view, so, fashioned, and, as, it, were, masked, as, to, make, them, pass, for, perfect, and, complete, for, if, you, consider, their, method, and, divisions, they, appear, to, embrace, and, comprise, everything, which, can, relate, to, the, subject, and, although, this, frame, be, badly, filled, up, and, resemble, an, empty, bladder, yet, it, presents, to, the, vulgar, understanding, the, form, and, appearance, of, a, perfect, science, the, first, and, most, ancient, investigators, of, truth, were, wont, on, the, contrary, with, more, honesty, and, success, to, throw, all, the, knowledge, they, wished, to, gather, from, contemplation, and, to, lay, up, for, use, into, aphorisms, or, short, scattered, sentences, unconnected, by, any, method, and, without, pretending, or, professing, to, comprehend, any, entire, art, but, according, to, the, present, system, we, cannot, wonder, that, men, seek, nothing, beyond, that, which, is, handed, down, to, them, as, perfect, and, already, extended, to, its, full, complement, the, ancient, theories, have, received, additional, support, and, credit, from, the, absurdity, and, levity, of, those, who, have, promoted, the, new, especially, in, the, active, and, practical, part, of, natural, philosophy, for, there, have, been, many, silly, and, fantastical, fellows, who, from, credulity, or, imposture, have, loaded, mankind, with, promises, announcing, and, boasting, of, the, prolongation, of, life, the, retarding, of, old, age, the, alleviation, of, pains, the, remedying, of, natural, defects, the, deception, of, the, senses, the, restraint, and, excitement, of, the, passions, the, illumination, and, exaltation, of, the, intellectual, faculties, the, transmutation, of, substances, the, unlimited, intensity, and, multiplication, of, motion, the, impressions, and, changes, of, the, air, the, bringing, into, our, power, the, management, of, celestial, influences, the, divination, of, future, events, the, representation, of, distant, objects, the, revelation, of, hidden, objects, and, the, like, one, would, not, be, very, wrong, in, observing, with, regard, to, such, pretenders, that, there, is, as, much, difference, in, philosophy, between, their, absurdity, and, real, science, as, there, is, in, history, between, the, exploits, of, cæsar, or, alexander, and, those, of, amadis, de, gaul, and, arthur, of, britain, for, those, illustrious, generals, are, found, to, have, actually, performed, greater, exploits, than, such, fictitious, heroes, are, even, pretended, to, have, accomplished, by, the, means, however, of, real, action, and, not, by, any, fabulous, and, portentous, power, yet, it, is, not, right, to, suffer, our, belief, in, true, history, to, be, diminished, because, it, is, sometimes, injured, and, violated, by, fables, in, the, meantime, we, cannot, wonder, that, great, prejudice, has, been, excited, against, any, new, propositions, (especially, when, coupled, with, any, mention, of, effects, to, be, produced), by, the, conduct, of, impostors, who, have, made, a, similar, attempt, for, their, extreme, absurdity, and, the, disgust, occasioned, by, it, has, even, to, this, day, overpowered, every, spirited, attempt, of, the, kind, want, of, energy, and, the, littleness, and, futility, of, the, tasks, that, human, industry, has, undertaken, have, produced, much, greater, injury, to, the, sciences, and, yet, (to, make, it, still, worse), that, very, want, of, energy, manifests, itself, in, conjunction, with, arrogance, and, disdain, for, in, the, first, place, one, excuse, now, from, its, repetition, become, familiar, is, to, be, observed, in, every, art, namely, that, its, promoters, convert, the, weakness, of, the, art, itself, into, a, calumny, upon, nature, and, whatever, it, in, their, hands, fails, to, effect, they, pronounce, to, be, physically, impossible, but, how, can, the, art, ever, be, condemned, while, it, acts, as, judge, in, its, own, cause, even, the, present, system, of, philosophy, cherishes, in, its, bosom, certain, positions, or, dogmas, which, (it, will, be, found, on, diligent, inquiry), are, calculated, to, produce, a, full, conviction, that, no, difficult, commanding, and, powerful, operation, upon, nature, ought, to, be, anticipated, through, the, means, of, art, we, instanced[50], above, the, alleged, different, quality, of, heat, in, the, sun, and, fire, and, composition, and, mixture, upon, an, accurate, observation, the, whole, tendency, of, such, positions, is, wilfully, to, circumscribe, man’s, power, and, to, produce, a, despair, of, the, means, of, invention, and, contrivance, which, would, not, only, confound, the, promises, of, hope, but, cut, the, very, springs, and, sinews, of, industry, and, throw, aside, even, the, chances, of, experience, the, only, object, of, such, philosophers, is, to, acquire, the, reputation, of, perfection, for, their, own, art, and, they, are, anxious, to, obtain, the, most, silly, and, abandoned, renown, by, causing, a, belief, that, whatever, has, not, yet, been, invented, and, understood, can, never, be, so, hereafter, but, if, any, one, attempt, to, give, himself, up, to, things, and, to, discover, something, new, yet, he, will, only, propose, and, destine, for, his, object, the, investigation, and, discovery, of, some, one, invention, and, nothing, more, as, the, nature, of, the, magnet, the, tides, the, heavenly, system, and, the, like, which, appear, enveloped, in, some, degree, of, mystery, and, have, hitherto, been, treated, with, but, little, success, now, it, is, the, greatest, proof, of, want, of, skill, to, investigate, the, nature, of, any, object, in, itself, alone, for, that, same, nature, which, seems, concealed, and, hidden, in, some, instances, is, manifest, and, almost, palpable, in, others, and, excites, wonder, in, the, former, while, it, hardly, attracts, attention, in, the, latter, [51], thus, the, nature, of, consistency, is, scarcely, observed, in, wood, or, stone, but, passed, over, by, the, term, solid, without, any, further, inquiry, about, the, repulsion, of, separation, or, the, solution, of, continuity, but, in, water-bubbles, the, same, circumstance, appears, matter, of, delicate, and, ingenious, research, for, they, form, themselves, into, thin, pellicles, curiously, shaped, into, hemispheres, so, as, for, an, instant, to, avoid, the, solution, of, continuity, in, general, those, very, things, which, are, considered, as, secret, are, manifest, and, common, in, other, objects, but, will, never, be, clearly, seen, if, the, experiments, and, contemplation, of, man, be, directed, to, themselves, only, yet, it, commonly, happens, that, if, in, the, mechanical, arts, any, one, bring, old, discoveries, to, a, finer, polish, or, more, elegant, height, of, ornament, or, unite, and, compound, them, or, apply, them, more, readily, to, practice, or, exhibit, them, on, a, less, heavy, and, voluminous, scale, and, the, like, they, will, pass, off, as, new, we, cannot, therefore, wonder, that, no, magnificent, discoveries, worthy, of, mankind, have, been, brought, to, light, while, men, are, satisfied, and, delighted, with, such, scanty, and, puerile, tasks, nay, even, think, that, they, have, pursued, or, attained, some, great, object, in, their, accomplishment, nor, should, we, neglect, to, observe, that, natural, philosophy, has, in, every, age, met, with, a, troublesome, and, difficult, opponent, mean, superstition, and, a, blind, and, immoderate, zeal, for, religion, for, we, see, that, among, the, greeks, those, who, first, disclosed, the, natural, causes, of, thunder, and, storms, to, the, yet, untrained, ears, of, man, were, condemned, as, guilty, of, impiety, toward, the, gods, [52], nor, did, some, of, the, old, fathers, of, christianity, treat, those, much, better, who, showed, by, the, most, positive, proofs, (such, as, no, one, now, disputes), that, the, earth, is, spherical, and, thence, asserted, that, there, were, antipodes, [53], even, in, the, present, state, of, things, the, condition, of, discussions, on, natural, philosophy, is, rendered, more, difficult, and, dangerous, by, the, summaries, and, methods, of, divines, who, after, reducing, divinity, into, such, order, as, they, could, and, brought, it, into, a, scientific, form, have, proceeded, to, mingle, an, undue, proportion, of, the, contentious, and, thorny, philosophy, of, aristotle, with, the, substance, of, religion, [54], the, fictions, of, those, who, have, not, feared, to, deduce, and, confirm, the, truth, of, the, christian, religion, by, the, principles, and, authority, of, philosophers, tend, to, the, same, end, though, in, a, different, manner, [55], they, celebrate, the, union, of, faith, and, the, senses, as, though, it, were, legitimate, with, great, pomp, and, solemnity, and, gratify, men’s, pleasing, minds, with, a, variety, but, in, the, meantime, confound, most, improperly, things, divine, and, human, moreover, in, these, mixtures, of, divinity, and, philosophy, the, received, doctrines, of, the, latter, are, alone, included, and, any, novelty, even, though, it, be, an, improvement, scarcely, escapes, banishment, and, extermination, in, short, you, may, find, all, access, to, any, species, of, philosophy, however, pure, intercepted, by, the, ignorance, of, divines, some, in, their, simplicity, are, apprehensive, that, a, too, deep, inquiry, into, nature, may, penetrate, beyond, the, proper, bounds, of, decorum, transferring, and, absurdly, applying, what, is, said, of, sacred, mysteries, in, holy, writ, against, those, who, pry, into, divine, secrets, to, the, mysteries, of, nature, which, are, not, forbidden, by, any, prohibition, others, with, more, cunning, imagine, and, consider, that, if, secondary, causes, be, unknown, everything, may, more, easily, be, referred, to, the, divine, hand, and, wand, a, matter, as, they, think, of, the, greatest, consequence, to, religion, but, which, can, only, really, mean, that, god, wishes, to, be, gratified, by, means, of, falsehood, others, fear, from, past, example, lest, motion, and, change, in, philosophy, should, terminate, in, an, attack, upon, religion, lastly, there, are, others, who, appear, anxious, lest, there, should, be, something, discovered, in, the, investigation, of, nature, to, overthrow, or, at, least, shake, religion, particularly, among, the, unlearned, the, last, two, apprehensions, appear, to, resemble, animal, instinct, as, if, men, were, diffident, in, the, bottom, of, their, minds, and, secret, meditations, of, the, strength, of, religion, and, the, empire, of, faith, over, the, senses, and, therefore, feared, that, some, danger, awaited, them, from, an, inquiry, into, nature, but, any, one, who, properly, considers, the, subject, will, find, natural, philosophy, to, be, after, the, word, of, god, the, surest, remedy, against, superstition, and, the, most, approved, support, of, faith, she, is, therefore, rightly, bestowed, upon, religion, as, a, most, faithful, attendant, for, the, one, exhibits, the, will, and, the, other, the, power, of, god, nor, was, he, wrong, who, observed, “ye, err, not, knowing, the, scriptures, and, the, power, of, god, ”, thus, uniting, in, one, bond, the, revelation, of, his, will, and, the, contemplation, of, his, power, in, the, meanwhile, it, is, not, wonderful, that, the, progress, of, natural, philosophy, has, been, restrained, since, religion, which, has, so, much, influence, on, men’s, minds, has, been, led, and, hurried, to, oppose, her, through, the, ignorance, of, some, and, the, imprudent, zeal, of, others, again, in, the, habits, and, regulations, of, schools, universities, and, the, like, assemblies, destined, for, the, abode, of, learned, men, and, the, improvement, of, learning, everything, is, found, to, be, opposed, to, the, progress, of, the, sciences, for, the, lectures, and, exercises, are, so, ordered, that, anything, out, of, the, common, track, can, scarcely, enter, the, thoughts, and, contemplations, of, the, mind, if, however, one, or, two, have, perhaps, dared, to, use, their, liberty, they, can, only, impose, the, labor, on, themselves, without, deriving, any, advantage, from, the, association, of, others, and, if, they, put, up, with, this, they, will, find, their, industry, and, spirit, of, no, slight, disadvantage, to, them, in, making, their, fortune, for, the, pursuits, of, men, in, such, situations, are, as, it, were, chained, down, to, the, writings, of, particular, authors, and, if, any, one, dare, to, dissent, from, them, he, is, immediately, attacked, as, a, turbulent, and, revolutionary, spirit, yet, how, great, is, the, difference, between, civil, matters, and, the, arts, for, there, is, not, the, same, danger, from, new, activity, and, new, light, in, civil, matters, even, a, change, for, the, better, is, suspected, on, account, of, the, commotion, it, occasions, for, civil, government, is, supported, by, authority, unanimity, fame, and, public, opinion, and, not, by, demonstration, in, the, arts, and, sciences, on, the, contrary, every, department, should, resound, as, in, mines, with, new, works, and, advances, and, this, is, the, rational, though, not, the, actual, view, of, the, case, for, that, administration, and, government, of, science, we, have, spoken, of, is, wont, too, rigorously, to, repress, its, growth, and, even, should, the, odium, have, alluded, to, be, avoided, yet, it, is, sufficient, to, repress, the, increase, of, science, that, such, attempts, and, industry, pass, unrewarded, for, the, cultivation, of, science, and, its, reward, belong, not, to, the, same, individual, the, advancement, of, science, is, the, work, of, a, powerful, genius, the, prize, and, reward, belong, to, the, vulgar, or, to, princes, who, (with, a, few, exceptions), are, scarcely, moderately, well, informed, nay, such, progress, is, not, only, deprived, of, the, rewards, and, beneficence, of, individuals, but, even, of, popular, praise, for, it, is, above, the, reach, of, the, generality, and, easily, overwhelmed, and, extinguished, by, the, winds, of, common, opinions, it, is, not, wonderful, therefore, that, little, success, has, attended, that, which, has, been, little, honored, but, by, far, the, greatest, obstacle, to, the, advancement, of, the, sciences, and, the, undertaking, of, any, new, attempt, or, department, is, to, be, found, in, men’s, despair, and, the, idea, of, impossibility, for, men, of, a, prudent, and, exact, turn, of, thought, are, altogether, diffident, in, matters, of, this, nature, considering, the, obscurity, of, nature, the, shortness, of, life, the, deception, of, the, senses, and, weakness, of, the, judgment, they, think, therefore, that, in, the, revolutions, of, ages, and, of, the, world, there, are, certain, floods, and, ebbs, of, the, sciences, and, that, they, grow, and, flourish, at, one, time, and, wither, and, fall, off, at, another, that, when, they, have, attained, a, certain, degree, and, condition, they, can, proceed, no, further, if, therefore, any, one, believe, or, promise, greater, things, they, impute, it, to, an, uncurbed, and, immature, mind, and, imagine, that, such, efforts, begin, pleasantly, then, become, laborious, and, end, in, confusion, and, since, such, thoughts, easily, enter, the, minds, of, men, of, dignity, and, excellent, judgment, we, must, really, take, heed, lest, we, should, be, captivated, by, our, affection, for, an, excellent, and, most, beautiful, object, and, relax, or, diminish, the, severity, of, our, judgment, and, we, must, diligently, examine, what, gleam, of, hope, shines, upon, us, and, in, what, direction, it, manifests, itself, so, that, banishing, her, lighter, dreams, we, may, discuss, and, weigh, whatever, appears, of, more, sound, importance, we, must, consult, the, prudence, of, ordinary, life, too, which, is, diffident, upon, principle, and, in, all, human, matters, augurs, the, worst, let, us, then, speak, of, hope, especially, as, we, are, not, vain, promisers, nor, are, willing, to, enforce, or, insnare, men’s, judgment, but, would, rather, lead, them, willingly, forward, and, although, we, shall, employ, the, most, cogent, means, of, enforcing, hope, when, we, bring, them, to, particulars, and, especially, those, which, are, digested, and, arranged, in, our, tables, of, invention, (the, subject, partly, of, the, second, but, principally, of, the, fourth, part, of, the, instauration), which, are, indeed, rather, the, very, object, of, our, hopes, than, hope, itself, yet, to, proceed, more, leniently, we, must, treat, of, the, preparation, of, men’s, minds, of, which, the, manifestation, of, hope, forms, no, slight, part, for, without, it, all, that, we, have, said, tends, rather, to, produce, a, gloom, than, to, encourage, activity, or, quicken, the, industry, of, experiment, by, causing, them, to, have, a, worse, and, more, contemptuous, opinion, of, things, as, they, are, than, they, now, entertain, and, to, perceive, and, feel, more, thoroughly, their, unfortunate, condition, we, must, therefore, disclose, and, prefix, our, reasons, for, not, thinking, the, hope, of, success, improbable, as, columbus, before, his, wonderful, voyage, over, the, atlantic, gave, the, reasons, of, his, conviction, that, new, lands, and, continents, might, be, discovered, besides, those, already, known, and, these, reasons, though, at, first, rejected, were, yet, proved, by, subsequent, experience, and, were, the, causes, and, beginnings, of, the, greatest, events, let, us, begin, from, god, and, show, that, our, pursuit, from, its, exceeding, goodness, clearly, proceeds, from, him, the, author, of, good, and, father, of, light, now, in, all, divine, works, the, smallest, beginnings, lead, assuredly, to, some, result, and, the, remark, in, spiritual, matters, that, “the, kingdom, of, god, cometh, without, observation, ”, is, also, found, to, be, true, in, every, great, work, of, divine, providence, so, that, everything, glides, quietly, on, without, confusion, or, noise, and, the, matter, is, achieved, before, men, either, think, or, perceive, that, it, is, commenced, nor, should, we, neglect, to, mention, the, prophecy, of, daniel, of, the, last, days, of, the, world, “many, shall, run, to, and, fro, and, knowledge, shall, be, increased, ”[56], thus, plainly, hinting, and, suggesting, that, fate, (which, is, providence), would, cause, the, complete, circuit, of, the, globe, (now, accomplished, or, at, least, going, forward, by, means, of, so, many, distant, voyages), and, the, increase, of, learning, to, happen, at, the, same, epoch, we, will, next, give, a, most, potent, reason, for, hope, deduced, from, the, errors, of, the, past, and, the, ways, still, unattempted, for, well, was, an, ill-governed, state, thus, reproved, “that, which, is, worst, with, regard, to, the, past, should, appear, most, consolatory, for, the, future, for, if, you, had, done, all, that, your, duty, commanded, and, your, affairs, proceeded, no, better, you, could, not, even, hope, for, their, improvement, but, since, their, present, unhappy, situation, is, not, owing, to, the, force, of, circumstances, but, to, your, own, errors, you, have, reason, to, hope, that, by, banishing, or, correcting, the, latter, you, can, produce, a, great, change, for, the, better, in, the, former, ”, so, if, men, had, during, the, many, years, that, have, elapsed, adhered, to, the, right, way, of, discovering, and, cultivating, the, sciences, without, being, able, to, advance, it, would, be, assuredly, bold, and, presumptuous, to, imagine, it, possible, to, improve, but, if, they, have, mistaken, the, way, and, wasted, their, labor, on, improper, objects, it, follows, that, the, difficulty, does, not, arise, from, things, themselves, which, are, not, in, our, power, but, from, the, human, understanding, its, practice, and, application, which, is, susceptible, of, remedy, and, correction, our, best, plan, therefore, is, to, expose, these, errors, for, in, proportion, as, they, impeded, the, past, so, do, they, afford, reason, to, hope, for, the, future, and, although, we, have, touched, upon, them, above, yet, we, think, it, right, to, give, a, brief, bare, and, simple, enumeration, of, them, in, this, place, those, who, have, treated, of, the, sciences, have, been, either, empirics, or, dogmatical, [57], the, former, like, ants, only, heap, up, and, use, their, store, the, latter, like, spiders, spin, out, their, own, webs, the, bee, a, mean, between, both, extracts, matter, from, the, flowers, of, the, garden, and, the, field, but, works, and, fashions, it, by, its, own, efforts, the, true, labor, of, philosophy, resembles, hers, for, it, neither, relies, entirely, or, principally, on, the, powers, of, the, mind, nor, yet, lays, up, in, the, memory, the, matter, afforded, by, the, experiments, of, natural, history, and, mechanics, in, its, raw, state, but, changes, and, works, it, in, the, understanding, we, have, good, reason, therefore, to, derive, hope, from, a, closer, and, purer, alliance, of, these, faculties, (the, experimental, and, rational), than, has, yet, been, attempted, natural, philosophy, is, not, yet, to, be, found, unadulterated, but, is, impure, and, corrupted--by, logic, in, the, school, of, aristotle, by, natural, theology, in, that, of, plato, [58], by, mathematics, in, the, second, school, of, plato, (that, of, proclus, and, others)[59], which, ought, rather, to, terminate, natural, philosophy, than, to, generate, or, create, it, we, may, therefore, hope, for, better, results, from, pure, and, unmixed, natural, philosophy, no, one, has, yet, been, found, possessed, of, sufficient, firmness, and, severity, to, resolve, upon, and, undertake, the, task, of, entirely, abolishing, common, theories, and, notions, and, applying, the, mind, afresh, when, thus, cleared, and, levelled, to, particular, researches, hence, our, human, reasoning, is, a, mere, farrago, and, crude, mass, made, up, of, a, great, deal, of, credulity, and, accident, and, the, puerile, notions, it, originally, contracted, but, if, a, man, of, mature, age, unprejudiced, senses, and, clear, mind, would, betake, himself, anew, to, experience, and, particulars, we, might, hope, much, more, from, such, a, one, in, which, respect, we, promise, ourselves, the, fortune, of, alexander, the, great, and, let, none, accuse, us, of, vanity, till, they, have, heard, the, tale, which, is, intended, to, check, vanity, for, æschines, spoke, thus, of, alexander, and, his, exploits, “we, live, not, the, life, of, mortals, but, are, born, at, such, a, period, that, posterity, will, relate, and, declare, our, prodigies”, as, if, he, considered, the, exploits, of, alexander, to, be, miraculous, but, in, succeeding, ages[60], livy, took, a, better, view, of, the, fact, and, has, made, some, such, observation, as, this, upon, alexander, “that, he, did, no, more, than, dare, to, despise, insignificance, ”, so, in, our, opinion, posterity, will, judge, of, us, that, we, have, achieved, no, great, matters, but, only, set, less, account, upon, what, is, considered, important, for, the, meantime, (as, we, have, before, observed), our, only, hope, is, in, the, regeneration, of, the, sciences, by, regularly, raising, them, on, the, foundation, of, experience, and, building, them, anew, which, think, none, can, venture, to, affirm, to, have, been, already, done, or, even, thought, of, the, foundations, of, experience, (our, sole, resource), have, hitherto, failed, completely, or, have, been, very, weak, nor, has, a, store, and, collection, of, particular, facts, capable, of, informing, the, mind, or, in, any, way, satisfactory, been, either, sought, after, or, amassed, on, the, contrary, learned, but, idle, and, indolent, men, have, received, some, mere, reports, of, experience, traditions, as, it, were, of, dreams, as, establishing, or, confirming, their, philosophy, and, have, not, hesitated, to, allow, them, the, weight, of, legitimate, evidence, so, that, a, system, has, been, pursued, in, philosophy, with, regard, to, experience, resembling, that, of, a, kingdom, or, state, which, would, direct, its, councils, and, affairs, according, to, the, gossip, of, city, and, street, politicians, instead, of, the, letters, and, reports, of, ambassadors, and, messengers, worthy, of, credit, nothing, is, rightly, inquired, into, or, verified, noted, weighed, or, measured, in, natural, history, indefinite, and, vague, observation, produces, fallacious, and, uncertain, information, if, this, appear, strange, or, our, complaint, somewhat, too, unjust, (because, aristotle, himself, so, distinguished, a, man, and, supported, by, the, wealth, of, so, great, a, king, has, completed, an, accurate, history, of, animals, to, which, others, with, greater, diligence, but, less, noise, have, made, considerable, additions, and, others, again, have, composed, copious, histories, and, notices, of, plants, metals, and, fossils), it, will, arise, from, a, want, of, sufficiently, attending, to, and, comprehending, our, present, observations, for, a, natural, history, compiled, on, its, own, account, and, one, collected, for, the, mind’s, information, as, a, foundation, for, philosophy, are, two, different, things, they, differ, in, several, respects, but, principally, in, this--the, former, contains, only, the, varieties, of, natural, species, without, the, experiments, of, mechanical, arts, for, as, in, ordinary, life, every, person’s, disposition, and, the, concealed, feelings, of, the, mind, and, passions, are, most, drawn, out, when, they, are, disturbed--so, the, secrets, of, nature, betray, themselves, more, readily, when, tormented, by, art, than, when, left, to, their, own, course, we, must, begin, therefore, to, entertain, hopes, of, natural, philosophy, then, only, when, we, have, a, better, compilation, of, natural, history, its, real, basis, and, support, again, even, in, the, abundance, of, mechanical, experiments, there, is, a, very, great, scarcity, of, those, which, best, inform, and, assist, the, understanding, for, the, mechanic, little, solicitous, about, the, investigation, of, truth, neither, directs, his, attention, nor, applies, his, hand, to, anything, that, is, not, of, service, to, his, business, but, our, hope, of, further, progress, in, the, sciences, will, then, only, be, well, founded, when, numerous, experiments, shall, be, received, and, collected, into, natural, history, which, though, of, no, use, in, themselves, assist, materially, in, the, discovery, of, causes, and, axioms, which, experiments, we, have, termed, enlightening, to, distinguish, them, from, those, which, are, profitable, they, possess, this, wonderful, property, and, nature, that, they, never, deceive, or, fail, you, for, being, used, only, to, discover, the, natural, cause, of, some, object, whatever, be, the, result, they, equally, satisfy, your, aim, by, deciding, the, question, we, must, not, only, search, for, and, procure, a, greater, number, of, experiments, but, also, introduce, a, completely, different, method, order, and, progress, of, continuing, and, promoting, experience, for, vague, and, arbitrary, experience, is, (as, we, have, observed), mere, groping, in, the, dark, and, rather, astonishes, than, instructs, but, when, experience, shall, proceed, regularly, and, uninterruptedly, by, a, determined, rule, we, may, entertain, better, hopes, of, the, sciences, but, after, having, collected, and, prepared, an, abundance, and, store, of, natural, history, and, of, the, experience, required, for, the, operations, of, the, understanding, or, philosophy, still, the, understanding, is, as, incapable, of, acting, on, such, materials, of, itself, with, the, aid, of, memory, alone, as, any, person, would, be, of, retaining, and, achieving, by, memory, the, computation, of, an, almanac, yet, meditation, has, hitherto, done, more, for, discovery, than, writing, and, no, experiments, have, been, committed, to, paper, we, cannot, however, approve, of, any, mode, of, discovery, without, writing, and, when, that, comes, into, more, general, use, we, may, have, further, hopes, besides, this, there, is, such, a, multitude, and, host, as, it, were, of, particular, objects, and, lying, so, widely, dispersed, as, to, distract, and, confuse, the, understanding, and, we, can, therefore, hope, for, no, advantage, from, its, skirmishing, and, quick, movements, and, incursions, unless, we, put, its, forces, in, due, order, and, array, by, means, of, proper, and, well, arranged, and, as, it, were, living, tables, of, discovery, of, these, matters, which, are, the, subject, of, investigation, and, the, mind, then, apply, itself, to, the, ready, prepared, and, digested, aid, which, such, tables, afford, when, we, have, thus, properly, and, regularly, placed, before, the, eyes, a, collection, of, particulars, we, must, not, immediately, proceed, to, the, investigation, and, discovery, of, new, particulars, or, effects, or, at, least, if, we, do, so, must, not, rest, satisfied, therewith, for, though, we, do, not, deny, that, by, transferring, the, experiments, from, one, art, to, another, (when, all, the, experiments, of, each, have, been, collected, and, arranged, and, have, been, acquired, by, the, knowledge, and, subjected, to, the, judgment, of, a, single, individual), many, new, experiments, may, be, discovered, tending, to, benefit, society, and, mankind, by, what, we, term, literate, experience, yet, comparatively, insignificant, results, are, to, be, expected, thence, while, the, more, important, are, to, be, derived, from, the, new, light, of, axioms, deduced, by, certain, method, and, rule, from, the, above, particulars, and, pointing, out, and, defining, new, particulars, in, their, turn, our, road, is, not, a, long, plain, but, rises, and, falls, ascending, to, axioms, and, descending, to, effects, nor, can, we, suffer, the, understanding, to, jump, and, fly, from, particulars, to, remote, and, most, general, axioms, (such, as, are, termed, the, principles, of, arts, and, things), and, thus, prove, and, make, out, their, intermediate, axioms, according, to, the, supposed, unshaken, truth, of, the, former, this, however, has, always, been, done, to, the, present, time, from, the, natural, bent, of, the, understanding, educated, too, and, accustomed, to, this, very, method, by, the, syllogistic, mode, of, demonstration, but, we, can, then, only, augur, well, for, the, sciences, when, the, assent, shall, proceed, by, a, true, scale, and, successive, steps, without, interruption, or, breach, from, particulars, to, the, lesser, axioms, thence, to, the, intermediate, (rising, one, above, the, other), and, lastly, to, the, most, general, for, the, lowest, axioms, differ, but, little, from, bare, experiment, [61], the, highest, and, most, general, (as, they, are, esteemed, at, present), are, notional, abstract, and, of, no, real, weight, the, intermediate, are, true, solid, full, of, life, and, upon, them, depend, the, business, and, fortune, of, mankind, beyond, these, are, the, really, general, but, not, abstract, axioms, which, are, truly, limited, by, the, intermediate, we, must, not, then, add, wings, but, rather, lead, and, ballast, to, the, understanding, to, prevent, its, jumping, or, flying, which, has, not, yet, been, done, but, whenever, this, takes, place, we, may, entertain, greater, hopes, of, the, sciences, in, forming, axioms, we, must, invent, a, different, form, of, induction, from, that, hitherto, in, use, not, only, for, the, proof, and, discovery, of, principles, (as, they, are, called), but, also, of, minor, intermediate, and, in, short, every, kind, of, axioms, the, induction, which, proceeds, by, simple, enumeration, is, puerile, leads, to, uncertain, conclusions, and, is, exposed, to, danger, from, one, contradictory, instance, deciding, generally, from, too, small, a, number, of, facts, and, those, only, the, most, obvious, but, a, really, useful, induction, for, the, discovery, and, demonstration, of, the, arts, and, sciences, should, separate, nature, by, proper, rejections, and, exclusions, and, then, conclude, for, the, affirmative, after, collecting, a, sufficient, number, of, negatives, now, this, has, not, been, done, nor, even, attempted, except, perhaps, by, plato, who, certainly, uses, this, form, of, induction, in, some, measure, to, sift, definitions, and, ideas, but, much, of, what, has, never, yet, entered, the, thoughts, of, man, must, necessarily, be, employed, in, order, to, exhibit, a, good, and, legitimate, mode, of, induction, or, demonstration, so, as, even, to, render, it, essential, for, us, to, bestow, more, pains, upon, it, than, have, hitherto, been, bestowed, on, syllogisms, the, assistance, of, induction, is, to, serve, us, not, only, in, the, discovery, of, axioms, but, also, in, defining, our, notions, much, indeed, is, to, be, hoped, from, such, an, induction, as, has, been, described, in, forming, our, axioms, from, induction, we, must, examine, and, try, whether, the, axiom, we, derive, be, only, fitted, and, calculated, for, the, particular, instances, from, which, it, is, deduced, or, whether, it, be, more, extensive, and, general, if, it, be, the, latter, we, must, observe, whether, it, confirm, its, own, extent, and, generality, by, giving, surety, as, it, were, in, pointing, out, new, particulars, so, that, we, may, neither, stop, at, actual, discoveries, nor, with, a, careless, grasp, catch, at, shadows, and, abstract, forms, instead, of, substances, of, a, determinate, nature, and, as, soon, as, we, act, thus, well, authorized, hope, may, with, reason, be, said, to, beam, upon, us, here, too, we, may, again, repeat, what, we, have, said, above, concerning, the, extending, of, natural, philosophy, and, reducing, particular, sciences, to, that, one, so, as, to, prevent, any, schism, or, dismembering, of, the, sciences, without, which, we, cannot, hope, to, advance, such, are, the, observations, we, would, make, in, order, to, remove, despair, and, excite, hope, by, bidding, farewell, to, the, errors, of, past, ages, or, by, their, correction, let, us, examine, whether, there, be, other, grounds, for, hope, and, first, if, many, useful, discoveries, have, occurred, to, mankind, by, chance, or, opportunity, without, investigation, or, attention, on, their, part, it, must, necessarily, be, acknowledged, that, much, more, may, be, brought, to, light, by, investigation, and, attention, if, it, be, regular, and, orderly, not, hasty, and, interrupted, for, although, it, may, now, and, then, happen, that, one, falls, by, chance, upon, something, that, had, before, escaped, considerable, efforts, and, laborious, inquiries, yet, undoubtedly, the, reverse, is, generally, the, case, we, may, therefore, hope, for, further, better, and, more, frequent, results, from, man’s, reason, industry, method, and, application, than, from, chance, and, mere, animal, instinct, and, the, like, which, have, hitherto, been, the, sources, of, invention, we, may, also, derive, some, reason, for, hope, from, the, circumstance, of, several, actual, inventions, being, of, such, a, nature, that, scarcely, any, one, could, have, formed, a, conjecture, about, them, previously, to, their, discovery, but, would, rather, have, ridiculed, them, as, impossible, for, men, are, wont, to, guess, about, new, subjects, from, those, they, are, already, acquainted, with, and, the, hasty, and, vitiated, fancies, they, have, thence, formed, than, which, there, cannot, be, a, more, fallacious, mode, of, reasoning, because, much, of, that, which, is, derived, from, the, sources, of, things, does, not, flow, in, their, usual, channel, if, for, instance, before, the, discovery, of, cannon, one, had, described, its, effects, in, the, following, manner, there, is, a, new, invention, by, which, walls, and, the, greatest, bulwarks, can, be, shaken, and, overthrown, from, a, considerable, distance, men, would, have, begun, to, contrive, various, means, of, multiplying, the, force, of, projectiles, and, machines, by, means, of, weights, and, wheels, and, other, modes, of, battering, and, projecting, but, it, is, improbable, that, any, imagination, or, fancy, would, have, hit, upon, a, fiery, blast, expanding, and, developing, itself, so, suddenly, and, violently, because, none, would, have, seen, an, instance, at, all, resembling, it, except, perhaps, in, earthquakes, or, thunder, which, they, would, have, immediately, rejected, as, the, great, operations, of, nature, not, to, be, imitated, by, man, so, if, before, the, discovery, of, silk, thread, any, one, had, observed, that, a, species, of, thread, had, been, discovered, fit, for, dresses, and, furniture, far, surpassing, the, thread, of, worsted, or, flax, in, fineness, and, at, the, same, time, in, tenacity, beauty, and, softness, men, would, have, begun, to, imagine, something, about, chinese, plants, or, the, fine, hair, of, some, animals, or, the, feathers, or, down, of, birds, but, certainly, would, never, have, had, an, idea, of, its, being, spun, by, a, small, worm, in, so, copious, a, manner, and, renewed, annually, but, if, any, one, had, ventured, to, suggest, the, silkworm, he, would, have, been, laughed, at, as, if, dreaming, of, some, new, manufacture, from, spiders, so, again, if, before, the, discovery, of, the, compass, any, one, had, said, that, an, instrument, had, been, invented, by, which, the, quarters, and, points, of, the, heavens, could, be, exactly, taken, and, distinguished, men, would, have, entered, into, disquisitions, on, the, refinement, of, astronomical, instruments, and, the, like, from, the, excitement, of, their, imaginations, but, the, thought, of, anything, being, discovered, which, not, being, a, celestial, body, but, a, mere, mineral, or, metallic, substance, should, yet, in, its, motion, agree, with, that, of, such, bodies, would, have, appeared, absolutely, incredible, yet, were, these, facts, and, the, like, (unknown, for, so, many, ages), not, discovered, at, last, either, by, philosophy, or, reasoning, but, by, chance, and, opportunity, and, (as, we, have, observed), they, are, of, a, nature, most, heterogeneous, and, remote, from, what, was, hitherto, known, so, that, no, previous, knowledge, could, lead, to, them, we, may, therefore, well, hope[62], that, many, excellent, and, useful, matters, are, yet, treasured, up, in, the, bosom, of, nature, bearing, no, relation, or, analogy, to, our, actual, discoveries, but, out, of, the, common, track, of, our, imagination, and, still, undiscovered, and, which, will, doubtless, be, brought, to, light, in, the, course, and, lapse, of, years, as, the, others, have, been, before, them, but, in, the, way, we, now, point, out, they, may, rapidly, and, at, once, be, both, represented, and, anticipated, there, are, moreover, some, inventions, which, render, it, probable, that, men, may, pass, and, hurry, over, the, most, noble, discoveries, which, lie, immediately, before, them, for, however, the, discovery, of, gunpowder, silk, the, compass, sugar, paper, or, the, like, may, appear, to, depend, on, peculiar, properties, of, things, and, nature, printing, at, least, involves, no, contrivance, which, is, not, clear, and, almost, obvious, but, from, want, of, observing, that, although, the, arrangement, of, the, types, of, letters, required, more, trouble, than, writing, with, the, hand, yet, these, types, once, arranged, serve, for, innumerable, impressions, while, manuscript, only, affords, one, copy, and, again, from, want, of, observing, that, ink, might, be, thickened, so, as, to, stain, without, running, (which, was, necessary, seeing, the, letters, face, upward, and, the, impression, is, made, from, above), this, most, beautiful, invention, (which, assists, so, materially, the, propagation, of, learning), remained, unknown, for, so, many, ages, the, human, mind, is, often, so, awkward, and, ill-regulated, in, the, career, of, invention, that, it, is, at, first, diffident, and, then, despises, itself, for, it, appears, at, first, incredible, that, any, such, discovery, should, be, made, and, when, it, has, been, made, it, appears, incredible, that, it, should, so, long, have, escaped, men’s, research, all, which, affords, good, reason, for, the, hope, that, a, vast, mass, of, inventions, yet, remains, which, may, be, deduced, not, only, from, the, investigation, of, new, modes, of, operation, but, also, from, transferring, comparing, and, applying, these, already, known, by, the, method, of, what, we, have, termed, literate, experience, nor, should, we, omit, another, ground, of, hope, let, men, only, consider, (if, they, will), their, infinite, expenditure, of, talent, time, and, fortune, in, matters, and, studies, of, far, inferior, importance, and, value, a, small, portion, of, which, applied, to, sound, and, solid, learning, would, be, sufficient, to, overcome, every, difficulty, and, we, have, thought, right, to, add, this, observation, because, we, candidly, own, that, such, a, collection, of, natural, and, experimental, history, as, we, have, traced, in, our, own, mind, and, as, is, really, necessary, is, a, great, and, as, it, were, royal, work, requiring, much, labor, and, expense, in, the, meantime, let, no, one, be, alarmed, at, the, multitude, of, particulars, but, rather, inclined, to, hope, on, that, very, account, for, the, particular, phenomena, of, the, arts, and, nature, are, in, reality, but, as, a, handful, when, compared, with, the, fictions, of, the, imagination, removed, and, separated, from, the, evidence, of, facts, the, termination, of, our, method, is, clear, and, had, almost, said, near, at, hand, the, other, admits, of, no, termination, but, only, of, infinite, confusion, for, men, have, hitherto, dwelt, but, little, or, rather, only, slightly, touched, upon, experience, while, they, have, wasted, much, time, on, theories, and, the, fictions, of, the, imagination, if, we, had, but, any, one, who, could, actually, answer, our, interrogations, of, nature, the, invention, of, all, causes, and, sciences, would, be, the, labor, of, but, a, few, years, we, think, some, ground, of, hope, is, afforded, by, our, own, example, which, is, not, mentioned, for, the, sake, of, boasting, but, as, a, useful, remark, let, those, who, distrust, their, own, powers, observe, myself, one, who, have, among, my, contemporaries, been, the, most, engaged, in, public, business, who, am, not, very, strong, in, health, (which, causes, a, great, loss, of, time), and, am, the, first, explorer, of, this, course, following, the, guidance, of, none, nor, even, communicating, my, thoughts, to, a, single, individual, yet, having, once, firmly, entered, in, the, right, way, and, submitting, the, powers, of, my, mind, to, things, have, somewhat, advanced, (as, make, bold, to, think), the, matter, now, treat, of, then, let, others, consider, what, may, be, hoped, from, men, who, enjoy, abundant, leisure, from, united, labors, and, the, succession, of, ages, after, these, suggestions, on, our, part, especially, in, a, course, which, is, not, confined, like, theories, to, individuals, but, admits, of, the, best, distribution, and, union, of, labor, and, effect, particularly, in, collecting, experiments, for, men, will, then, only, begin, to, know, their, own, power, when, each, performs, a, separate, part, instead, of, undertaking, in, crowds, the, same, work, lastly, though, a, much, more, faint, and, uncertain, breeze, of, hope, were, to, spring, up, from, our, new, continent, yet, we, consider, it, necessary, to, make, the, experiment, if, we, would, not, show, a, dastard, spirit, for, the, risk, attending, want, of, success, is, not, to, be, compared, with, that, of, neglecting, the, attempt, the, former, is, attended, with, the, loss, of, a, little, human, labor, the, latter, with, that, of, an, immense, benefit, for, these, and, other, reasons, it, appears, to, us, that, there, is, abundant, ground, to, hope, and, to, induce, not, only, those, who, are, sanguine, to, make, experiment, but, even, those, who, are, cautious, and, sober, to, give, their, assent, such, are, the, grounds, for, banishing, despair, hitherto, one, of, the, most, powerful, causes, of, the, delay, and, restraint, to, which, the, sciences, have, been, subjected, in, treating, of, which, we, have, at, the, same, time, discussed, the, signs, and, causes, of, the, errors, idleness, and, ignorance, that, have, prevailed, seeing, especially, that, the, more, refined, causes, which, are, not, open, to, popular, judgment, and, observation, may, be, referred, to, our, remarks, on, the, idols, of, the, human, mind, here, too, we, should, close, the, demolishing, branch, of, our, instauration, which, is, comprised, in, three, confutations, 1, the, confutation, of, natural, human, reason, left, to, itself, 2, the, confutation, of, demonstration, 3, the, confutation, of, theories, or, received, systems, of, philosophy, and, doctrines, our, confutation, has, followed, such, a, course, as, was, open, to, it, namely, the, exposing, of, the, signs, of, error, and, the, producing, evidence, of, the, causes, of, it, for, we, could, adopt, no, other, differing, as, we, do, both, in, first, principles, and, demonstrations, from, others, it, is, time, for, us, therefore, to, come, to, the, art, itself, and, the, rule, for, the, interpretation, of, nature, there, is, however, still, something, which, must, not, be, passed, over, for, the, intent, of, this, first, book, of, aphorisms, being, to, prepare, the, mind, for, understanding, as, well, as, admitting, what, follows, we, must, now, after, having, cleansed, polished, and, levelled, its, surface, place, it, in, a, good, position, and, as, it, were, a, benevolent, aspect, toward, our, propositions, seeing, that, prejudice, in, new, matters, may, be, produced, not, only, by, the, strength, of, preconceived, notions, but, also, by, a, false, anticipation, or, expectation, of, the, matter, proposed, we, shall, therefore, endeavor, to, induce, good, and, correct, opinions, of, what, we, offer, although, this, be, only, necessary, for, the, moment, and, as, it, were, laid, out, at, interest, until, the, matter, itself, be, well, understood, first, then, we, must, desire, men, not, to, suppose, that, we, are, ambitious, of, founding, any, philosophical, sect, like, the, ancient, greeks, or, some, moderns, as, telesius, patricius, and, severinus, [63], for, neither, is, this, our, intention, nor, do, we, think, that, peculiar, abstract, opinions, on, nature, and, the, principles, of, things, are, of, much, importance, to, men’s, fortunes, since, it, were, easy, to, revive, many, ancient, theories, and, to, introduce, many, new, ones, as, for, instance, many, hypotheses, with, regard, to, the, heavens, can, be, formed, differing, in, themselves, and, yet, sufficiently, according, with, the, phenomena, we, bestow, not, our, labor, on, such, theoretical, and, at, the, same, time, useless, topics, on, the, contrary, our, determination, is, that, of, trying, whether, we, can, lay, a, firmer, foundation, and, extend, to, a, greater, distance, the, boundaries, of, human, power, and, dignity, and, although, here, and, there, upon, some, particular, points, we, hold, (in, our, own, opinion), more, true, and, certain, and, might, even, say, more, advantageous, tenets, than, those, in, general, repute, (which, we, have, collected, in, the, fifth, part, of, our, instauration), yet, we, offer, no, universal, or, complete, theory, the, time, does, not, yet, appear, to, us, to, be, arrived, and, we, entertain, no, hope, of, our, life, being, prolonged, to, the, completion, of, the, sixth, part, of, the, instauration, (which, is, destined, for, philosophy, discovered, by, the, interpretation, of, nature), but, are, content, if, we, proceed, quietly, and, usefully, in, our, intermediate, pursuit, scattering, in, the, meantime, the, seeds, of, less, adulterated, truth, for, posterity, and, at, least, commence, the, great, work, and, as, we, pretend, not, to, found, a, sect, so, do, we, neither, offer, nor, promise, particular, effects, which, may, occasion, some, to, object, to, us, that, since, we, so, often, speak, of, effects, and, consider, everything, in, its, relation, to, that, end, we, ought, also, to, give, some, earnest, of, producing, them, our, course, and, method, however, (as, we, have, often, said, and, again, repeat), is, such, as, not, to, deduce, effects, from, effects, nor, experiments, from, experiments, (as, the, empirics, do), but, in, our, capacity, of, legitimate, interpreters, of, nature, to, deduce, causes, and, axioms, from, effects, and, experiments, and, new, effects, and, experiments, from, those, causes, and, axioms, and, although, any, one, of, moderate, intelligence, and, ability, will, observe, the, indications, and, sketches, of, many, noble, effects, in, our, tables, of, inventions, (which, form, the, fourth, part, of, the, instauration), and, also, in, the, examples, of, particular, instances, cited, in, the, second, part, as, well, as, in, our, observations, on, history, (which, is, the, subject, of, the, third, part), yet, we, candidly, confess, that, our, present, natural, history, whether, compiled, from, books, or, our, own, inquiries, is, not, sufficiently, copious, and, well, ascertained, to, satisfy, or, even, assist, a, proper, interpretation, if, therefore, there, be, any, one, who, is, more, disposed, and, prepared, for, mechanical, art, and, ingenious, in, discovering, effects, than, in, the, mere, management, of, experiment, we, allow, him, to, employ, his, industry, in, gathering, many, of, the, fruits, of, our, history, and, tables, in, this, way, and, applying, them, to, effects, receiving, them, as, interest, till, he, can, obtain, the, principal, for, our, own, part, having, a, greater, object, in, view, we, condemn, all, hasty, and, premature, rest, in, such, pursuits, as, we, would, atalanta’s, apple, (to, use, a, common, allusion, of, ours), for, we, are, not, childishly, ambitious, of, golden, fruit, but, use, all, our, efforts, to, make, the, course, of, art, outstrip, nature, and, we, hasten, not, to, reap, moss, or, the, green, blade, but, wait, for, a, ripe, harvest, there, will, be, some, without, doubt, who, on, a, perusal, of, our, history, and, tables, of, invention, will, meet, with, some, uncertainty, or, perhaps, fallacy, in, the, experiments, themselves, and, will, thence, perhaps, imagine, that, our, discoveries, are, built, on, false, foundations, and, principles, there, is, however, really, nothing, in, this, since, it, must, needs, happen, in, beginnings, [64], for, it, is, the, same, as, if, in, writing, or, printing, one, or, two, letters, were, wrongly, turned, or, misplaced, which, is, no, great, inconvenience, to, the, reader, who, can, easily, by, his, own, eye, correct, the, error, let, men, in, the, same, way, conclude, that, many, experiments, in, natural, history, may, be, erroneously, believed, and, admitted, which, are, easily, expunged, and, rejected, afterward, by, the, discovery, of, causes, and, axioms, it, is, however, true, that, if, these, errors, in, natural, history, and, experiments, become, great, frequent, and, continued, they, cannot, be, corrected, and, amended, by, any, dexterity, of, wit, or, art, if, then, even, in, our, natural, history, well, examined, and, compiled, with, such, diligence, strictness, and, might, say), reverential, scruples, there, be, now, and, then, something, false, and, erroneous, in, the, details, what, must, we, say, of, the, common, natural, history, which, is, so, negligent, and, careless, when, compared, with, ours, or, of, systems, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, based, on, such, loose, soil, (or, rather, quicksand), let, none, then, be, alarmed, by, such, observations, again, our, history, and, experiments, will, contain, much, that, is, light, and, common, mean, and, illiberal, too, refined, and, merely, speculative, and, as, it, were, of, no, use, and, this, perhaps, may, divert, and, alienate, the, attention, of, mankind, with, regard, to, what, is, common, let, men, reflect, that, they, have, hitherto, been, used, to, do, nothing, but, refer, and, adapt, the, causes, of, things, of, rare, occurrence, to, those, of, things, which, more, frequently, happen, without, any, investigation, of, the, causes, of, the, latter, taking, them, for, granted, and, admitted, hence, they, do, not, inquire, into, the, causes, of, gravity, the, rotation, of, the, heavenly, bodies, heat, cold, light, hardness, softness, rarity, density, liquidity, solidity, animation, inanimation, similitude, difference, organic, formation, but, taking, them, to, be, self-evident, manifest, and, admitted, they, dispute, and, decide, upon, other, matters, of, less, frequent, and, familiar, occurrence, but, we, (who, know, that, no, judgment, can, be, formed, of, that, which, is, rare, or, remarkable, and, much, less, anything, new, brought, to, light, without, a, previous, regular, examination, and, discovery, of, the, causes, of, that, which, is, common, and, the, causes, again, of, those, causes), are, necessarily, compelled, to, admit, the, most, common, objects, into, our, history, besides, we, have, observed, that, nothing, has, been, so, injurious, to, philosophy, as, this, circumstance, namely, that, familiar, and, frequent, objects, do, not, arrest, and, detain, men’s, contemplation, but, are, carelessly, admitted, and, their, causes, never, inquired, after, so, that, information, on, unknown, subjects, is, not, more, often, wanted, than, attention, to, those, which, are, known, with, regard, to, the, meanness, or, even, the, filthiness, of, particulars, for, which, (as, pliny, observes), an, apology, is, requisite, such, subjects, are, no, less, worthy, of, admission, into, natural, history, than, the, most, magnificent, and, costly, nor, do, they, at, all, pollute, natural, history, for, the, sun, enters, alike, the, palace, and, the, privy, and, is, not, thereby, polluted, we, neither, dedicate, nor, raise, a, capitol, or, pyramid, to, the, pride, of, man, but, rear, a, holy, temple, in, his, mind, on, the, model, of, the, universe, which, model, therefore, we, imitate, for, that, which, is, deserving, of, existence, is, deserving, of, knowledge, the, image, of, existence, now, the, mean, and, splendid, alike, exist, nay, as, the, finest, odors, are, sometimes, produced, from, putrid, matter, (such, as, musk, and, civet), so, does, valuable, light, and, information, emanate, from, mean, and, sordid, instances, but, we, have, already, said, too, much, for, such, fastidious, feelings, are, childish, and, effeminate, the, next, point, requires, a, more, accurate, consideration, namely, that, many, parts, of, our, history, will, appear, to, the, vulgar, or, even, any, mind, accustomed, to, the, present, state, of, things, fantastically, and, uselessly, refined, hence, we, have, in, regard, to, this, matter, said, from, the, first, and, must, again, repeat, that, we, look, for, experiments, that, shall, afford, light, rather, than, profit, imitating, the, divine, creation, which, as, we, have, often, observed, only, produced, light, on, the, first, day, and, assigned, that, whole, day, to, its, creation, without, adding, any, material, work, if, any, one, then, imagine, such, matters, to, be, of, no, use, he, might, equally, suppose, light, to, be, of, no, use, because, it, is, neither, solid, nor, material, for, in, fact, the, knowledge, of, simple, natures, when, sufficiently, investigated, and, defined, resembles, light, which, though, of, no, great, use, in, itself, affords, access, to, the, general, mysteries, of, effects, and, with, a, peculiar, power, comprehends, and, draws, with, it, whole, bands, and, troops, of, effects, and, the, sources, of, the, most, valuable, axioms, so, also, the, elements, of, letters, have, of, themselves, separately, no, meaning, and, are, of, no, use, yet, are, they, as, it, were, the, original, matter, in, the, composition, and, preparation, of, speech, the, seeds, of, substances, whose, effect, is, powerful, are, of, no, use, except, in, their, growth, and, the, scattered, rays, of, light, itself, avail, not, unless, collected, but, if, speculative, subtilties, give, offence, what, must, we, say, of, the, scholastic, philosophers, who, indulged, in, them, to, such, excess, and, those, subtilties, were, wasted, on, words, or, at, least, common, notions, (which, is, the, same, thing), not, on, things, or, nature, and, alike, unproductive, of, benefit, in, their, origin, and, their, consequences, in, no, way, resembling, ours, which, are, at, present, useless, but, in, their, consequences, of, infinite, benefit, let, men, be, assured, that, all, subtile, disputes, and, discursive, efforts, of, the, mind, are, late, and, preposterous, when, they, are, introduced, subsequently, to, the, discovery, of, axioms, and, that, their, true, or, at, any, rate, chief, opportunity, is, when, experiment, is, to, be, weighed, and, axioms, to, be, derived, from, it, they, otherwise, catch, and, grasp, at, nature, but, never, seize, or, detain, her, and, we, may, well, apply, to, nature, that, which, has, been, said, of, opportunity, or, fortune, that, she, wears, a, lock, in, front, but, is, bald, behind, in, short, we, may, reply, decisively, to, those, who, despise, any, part, of, natural, history, as, being, vulgar, mean, or, subtile, and, useless, in, its, origin, in, the, words, of, a, poor, woman, to, a, haughty, prince, [65], who, had, rejected, her, petition, as, unworthy, and, beneath, the, dignity, of, his, majesty, “then, cease, to, reign”, for, it, is, quite, certain, that, the, empire, of, nature, can, neither, be, obtained, nor, administered, by, one, who, refuses, to, pay, attention, to, such, matters, as, being, poor, and, too, minute, again, it, may, be, objected, to, us, as, being, singular, and, harsh, that, we, should, with, one, stroke, and, assault, as, it, were, banish, all, authorities, and, sciences, and, that, too, by, our, own, efforts, without, requiring, the, assistance, and, support, of, any, of, the, ancients, now, we, are, aware, that, had, we, been, ready, to, act, otherwise, than, sincerely, it, was, not, difficult, to, refer, our, present, method, to, remote, ages, prior, to, those, of, the, greeks, (since, the, sciences, in, all, probability, flourished, more, in, their, natural, state, though, silently, than, when, they, were, paraded, with, the, fifes, and, trumpets, of, the, greeks), or, even, (in, parts, at, least), to, some, of, the, greeks, themselves, and, to, derive, authority, and, honor, from, thence, as, men, of, no, family, labor, to, raise, and, form, nobility, for, themselves, in, some, ancient, line, by, the, help, of, genealogies, trusting, however, to, the, evidence, of, facts, we, reject, every, kind, of, fiction, and, imposture, and, think, it, of, no, more, consequence, to, our, subject, whether, future, discoveries, were, known, to, the, ancients, and, set, or, rose, according, to, the, vicissitudes, of, events, and, lapse, of, ages, than, it, would, be, of, importance, to, mankind, to, know, whether, the, new, world, be, the, island, of, atlantis, [66], and, known, to, the, ancients, or, be, now, discovered, for, the, first, time, with, regard, to, the, universal, censure, we, have, bestowed, it, is, quite, clear, to, any, one, who, properly, considers, the, matter, that, it, is, both, more, probable, and, more, modest, than, any, partial, one, could, have, been, for, if, the, errors, had, not, been, rooted, in, the, primary, notions, some, well, conducted, discoveries, must, have, corrected, others, that, were, deficient, but, since, the, errors, were, fundamental, and, of, such, a, nature, that, men, may, be, said, rather, to, have, neglected, or, passed, over, things, than, to, have, formed, a, wrong, or, false, judgment, of, them, it, is, little, to, be, wondered, at, that, they, did, not, obtain, what, they, never, aimed, at, nor, arrive, at, a, goal, which, they, had, not, determined, nor, perform, a, course, which, they, had, neither, entered, upon, nor, adhered, to, with, regard, to, our, presumption, we, allow, that, if, we, were, to, assume, a, power, of, drawing, a, more, perfect, straight, line, or, circle, than, any, one, else, by, superior, steadiness, of, hand, or, acuteness, of, eye, it, would, lead, to, a, comparison, of, talent, but, if, one, merely, assert, that, he, can, draw, a, more, perfect, line, or, circle, with, a, ruler, or, compasses, than, another, can, by, his, unassisted, hand, or, eye, he, surely, cannot, be, said, to, boast, of, much, now, this, applies, not, only, to, our, first, original, attempt, but, also, to, those, who, shall, hereafter, apply, themselves, to, the, pursuit, for, our, method, of, discovering, the, sciences, merely, levels, men’s, wits, and, leaves, but, little, to, their, superiority, since, it, achieves, everything, by, the, most, certain, rules, and, demonstrations, whence, (as, we, have, often, observed), our, attempt, is, to, be, attributed, to, fortune, rather, than, talent, and, is, the, offspring, of, time, rather, than, of, wit, for, a, certain, sort, of, chance, has, no, less, effect, upon, our, thoughts, than, on, our, acts, and, deeds, we, may, therefore, apply, to, ourselves, the, joke, of, him, who, said, that, water, and, wine, drinkers, could, not, think, alike, [67], especially, as, it, hits, the, matter, so, well, for, others, both, ancients, and, moderns, have, in, the, sciences, drank, a, crude, liquor, like, water, either, flowing, of, itself, from, the, understanding, or, drawn, up, by, logic, as, the, wheel, draws, up, the, bucket, but, we, drink, and, pledge, others, with, a, liquor, made, of, many, well-ripened, grapes, collected, and, plucked, from, particular, branches, squeezed, in, the, press, and, at, last, clarified, and, fermented, in, a, vessel, it, is, not, therefore, wonderful, that, we, should, not, agree, with, others, another, objection, will, without, doubt, be, made, namely, that, we, have, not, ourselves, established, a, correct, or, the, best, goal, or, aim, of, the, sciences, (the, very, defect, we, blame, in, others), for, they, will, say, that, the, contemplation, of, truth, is, more, dignified, and, exalted, than, any, utility, or, extent, of, effects, but, that, our, dwelling, so, long, and, anxiously, on, experience, and, matter, and, the, fluctuating, state, of, particulars, fastens, the, mind, to, earth, or, rather, casts, it, down, into, an, abyss, of, confusion, and, disturbance, and, separates, and, removes, it, from, a, much, more, divine, state, the, quiet, and, tranquillity, of, abstract, wisdom, we, willingly, assent, to, their, reasoning, and, are, most, anxious, to, effect, the, very, point, they, hint, at, and, require, for, we, are, founding, a, real, model, of, the, world, in, the, understanding, such, as, it, is, found, to, be, not, such, as, man’s, reason, has, distorted, now, this, cannot, be, done, without, dissecting, and, anatomizing, the, world, most, diligently, but, we, declare, it, necessary, to, destroy, completely, the, vain, little, and, as, it, were, apish, imitations, of, the, world, which, have, been, formed, in, various, systems, of, philosophy, by, men’s, fancies, let, men, learn, (as, we, have, said, above), the, difference, that, exists, between, the, idols, of, the, human, mind, and, the, ideas, of, the, divine, mind, the, former, are, mere, arbitrary, abstractions, the, latter, the, true, marks, of, the, creator, on, his, creatures, as, they, are, imprinted, on, and, defined, in, matter, by, true, and, exquisite, touches, truth, therefore, and, utility, are, here, perfectly, identical, and, the, effects, are, of, more, value, as, pledges, of, truth, than, from, the, benefit, they, confer, on, men, others, may, object, that, we, are, only, doing, that, which, has, already, been, done, and, that, the, ancients, followed, the, same, course, as, ourselves, they, may, imagine, therefore, that, after, all, this, stir, and, exertion, we, shall, at, last, arrive, at, some, of, those, systems, that, prevailed, among, the, ancients, for, that, they, too, when, commencing, their, meditations, laid, up, a, great, store, of, instances, and, particulars, and, digested, them, under, topics, and, titles, in, their, commonplace, books, and, so, worked, out, their, systems, and, arts, and, then, decided, upon, what, they, discovered, and, related, now, and, then, some, examples, to, confirm, and, throw, light, upon, their, doctrine, but, thought, it, superfluous, and, troublesome, to, publish, their, notes, minutes, and, commonplaces, and, therefore, followed, the, example, of, builders, who, remove, the, scaffolding, and, ladders, when, the, building, is, finished, nor, can, we, indeed, believe, the, case, to, have, been, otherwise, but, to, any, one, not, entirely, forgetful, of, our, previous, observations, it, will, be, easy, to, answer, this, objection, or, rather, scruple, for, we, allow, that, the, ancients, had, a, particular, form, of, investigation, and, discovery, and, their, writings, show, it, but, it, was, of, such, a, nature, that, they, immediately, flew, from, a, few, instances, and, particulars, (after, adding, some, common, notions, and, a, few, generally, received, opinions, most, in, vogue), to, the, most, general, conclusions, or, the, principles, of, the, sciences, and, then, by, their, intermediate, propositions, deduced, their, inferior, conclusions, and, tried, them, by, the, test, of, the, immovable, and, settled, truth, of, the, first, and, so, constructed, their, art, lastly, if, some, new, particulars, and, instances, were, brought, forward, which, contradicted, their, dogmas, they, either, with, great, subtilty, reduced, them, to, one, system, by, distinctions, or, explanations, of, their, own, rules, or, got, rid, of, them, clumsily, as, exceptions, laboring, most, pertinaciously, in, the, meantime, to, accommodate, the, causes, of, such, as, were, not, contradictory, to, their, own, principles, their, natural, history, and, their, experience, were, both, far, from, being, what, they, ought, to, have, been, and, their, flying, off, to, generalities, ruined, everything, another, objection, will, be, made, against, us, that, we, prohibit, decisions, and, the, laying, down, of, certain, principles, till, we, arrive, regularly, at, generalities, by, the, intermediate, steps, and, thus, keep, the, judgment, in, suspense, and, lead, to, uncertainty, but, our, object, is, not, uncertainty, but, fitting, certainty, for, we, derogate, not, from, the, senses, but, assist, them, and, despise, not, the, understanding, but, direct, it, it, is, better, to, know, what, is, necessary, and, not, to, imagine, we, are, fully, in, possession, of, it, than, to, imagine, that, we, are, fully, in, possession, of, it, and, yet, in, reality, to, know, nothing, which, we, ought, again, some, may, raise, this, question, rather, than, objection, whether, we, talk, of, perfecting, natural, philosophy, alone, according, to, our, method, or, the, other, sciences, also, such, as, logic, ethics, politics, we, certainly, intend, to, comprehend, them, all, and, as, common, logic, which, regulates, matters, by, syllogisms, is, applied, not, only, to, natural, but, also, to, every, other, science, so, our, inductive, method, likewise, comprehends, them, all, [68], for, we, form, a, history, and, tables, of, invention, for, anger, fear, shame, and, the, like, and, also, for, examples, in, civil, life, and, the, mental, operations, of, memory, composition, division, judgment, and, the, rest, as, well, as, for, heat, and, cold, light, vegetation, and, the, like, but, since, our, method, of, interpretation, after, preparing, and, arranging, a, history, does, not, content, itself, with, examining, the, operations, and, disquisitions, of, the, mind, like, common, logic, but, also, inspects, the, nature, of, things, we, so, regulate, the, mind, that, it, may, be, enabled, to, apply, itself, in, every, respect, correctly, to, that, nature, on, that, account, we, deliver, numerous, and, various, precepts, in, our, doctrine, of, interpretation, so, that, they, may, apply, in, some, measure, to, the, method, of, discovering, the, quality, and, condition, of, the, subject, matter, of, investigation, let, none, even, doubt, whether, we, are, anxious, to, destroy, and, demolish, the, philosophy, arts, and, sciences, which, are, now, in, use, on, the, contrary, we, readily, cherish, their, practice, cultivation, and, honor, for, we, by, no, means, interfere, to, prevent, the, prevalent, system, from, encouraging, discussion, adorning, discourses, or, being, employed, serviceably, in, the, chair, of, the, professor, or, the, practice, of, common, life, and, being, taken, in, short, by, general, consent, as, current, coin, nay, we, plainly, declare, that, the, system, we, offer, will, not, be, very, suitable, for, such, purposes, not, being, easily, adapted, to, vulgar, apprehensions, except, by, effects, and, works, to, show, our, sincerity, in, professing, our, regard, and, friendly, disposition, toward, the, received, sciences, we, can, refer, to, the, evidence, of, our, published, writings, (especially, our, books, on, the, advancement, of, learning), we, will, not, therefore, endeavor, to, evince, it, any, further, by, words, but, content, ourselves, with, steadily, and, professedly, premising, that, no, great, progress, can, be, made, by, the, present, methods, in, the, theory, or, contemplation, of, science, and, that, they, cannot, be, made, to, produce, any, very, abundant, effects, it, remains, for, us, to, say, a, few, words, on, the, excellence, of, our, proposed, end, if, we, had, done, so, before, we, might, have, appeared, merely, to, express, our, wishes, but, now, that, we, have, excited, hope, and, removed, prejudices, it, will, perhaps, have, greater, weight, had, we, performed, and, completely, accomplished, the, whole, without, frequently, calling, in, others, to, assist, in, our, labors, we, should, then, have, refrained, from, saying, any, more, lest, we, should, be, thought, to, extol, our, own, deserts, since, however, the, industry, of, others, must, be, quickened, and, their, courage, roused, and, inflamed, it, is, right, to, recall, some, points, to, their, memory, first, then, the, introduction, of, great, inventions, appears, one, of, the, most, distinguished, of, human, actions, and, the, ancients, so, considered, it, for, they, assigned, divine, honors, to, the, authors, of, inventions, but, only, heroic, honors, to, those, who, displayed, civil, merit, (such, as, the, founders, of, cities, and, empire, legislators, the, deliverers, of, their, country, from, lasting, misfortunes, the, quellers, of, tyrants, and, the, like), and, if, any, one, rightly, compare, them, he, will, find, the, judgment, of, antiquity, to, be, correct, for, the, benefits, derived, from, inventions, may, extend, to, mankind, in, general, but, civil, benefits, to, particular, spots, alone, the, latter, moreover, last, but, for, a, time, the, former, forever, civil, reformation, seldom, is, carried, on, without, violence, and, confusion, while, inventions, are, a, blessing, and, a, benefit, without, injuring, or, afflicting, any, inventions, are, also, as, it, were, new, creations, and, imitations, of, divine, works, as, was, expressed, by, the, poet, [69], “primum, frugiferos, fœtus, mortalibus, ægris, dididerant, quondam, præstanti, nomine, athenæ, et, _recreaverunt_, vitam, legesque, rogarunt, ”, and, it, is, worthy, of, remark, in, solomon, that, while, he, flourished, in, the, possession, of, his, empire, in, wealth, in, the, magnificence, of, his, works, in, his, court, his, household, his, fleet, the, splendor, of, his, name, and, the, most, unbounded, admiration, of, mankind, he, still, placed, his, glory, in, none, of, these, but, declared[70], that, it, is, the, glory, of, god, to, conceal, a, thing, but, the, glory, of, a, king, to, search, it, out, again, let, any, one, but, consider, the, immense, difference, between, men’s, lives, in, the, most, polished, countries, of, europe, and, in, any, wild, and, barbarous, region, of, the, new, indies, he, will, think, it, so, great, that, man, may, be, said, to, be, a, god, unto, man, not, only, on, account, of, mutual, aid, and, benefits, but, from, their, comparative, states--the, result, of, the, arts, and, not, of, the, soil, or, climate, again, we, should, notice, the, force, effect, and, consequences, of, inventions, which, are, nowhere, more, conspicuous, than, in, those, three, which, were, unknown, to, the, ancients, namely, printing, gunpowder, and, the, compass, for, these, three, have, changed, the, appearance, and, state, of, the, whole, world, first, in, literature, then, in, warfare, and, lastly, in, navigation, and, innumerable, changes, have, been, thence, derived, so, that, no, empire, sect, or, star, appears, to, have, exercised, a, greater, power, and, influence, on, human, affairs, than, these, mechanical, discoveries, it, will, perhaps, be, as, well, to, distinguish, three, species, and, degrees, of, ambition, first, that, of, men, who, are, anxious, to, enlarge, their, own, power, in, their, country, which, is, a, vulgar, and, degenerate, kind, next, that, of, men, who, strive, to, enlarge, the, power, and, empire, of, their, country, over, mankind, which, is, more, dignified, but, not, less, covetous, but, if, one, were, to, endeavor, to, renew, and, enlarge, the, power, and, empire, of, mankind, in, general, over, the, universe, such, ambition, (if, it, may, be, so, termed), is, both, more, sound, and, more, noble, than, the, other, two, now, the, empire, of, man, over, things, is, founded, on, the, arts, and, sciences, alone, for, nature, is, only, to, be, commanded, by, obeying, her, besides, this, if, the, benefit, of, any, particular, invention, has, had, such, an, effect, as, to, induce, men, to, consider, him, greater, than, a, man, who, has, thus, obliged, the, whole, race, how, much, more, exalted, will, that, discovery, be, which, leads, to, the, easy, discovery, of, everything, else, yet, (to, speak, the, truth), in, the, same, manner, as, we, are, very, thankful, for, light, which, enables, us, to, enter, on, our, way, to, practice, arts, to, read, to, distinguish, each, other, and, yet, sight, is, more, excellent, and, beautiful, than, the, various, uses, of, light, so, is, the, contemplation, of, things, as, they, are, free, from, superstition, or, imposture, error, or, confusion, much, more, dignified, in, itself, than, all, the, advantage, to, be, derived, from, discoveries, lastly, let, none, be, alarmed, at, the, objection, of, the, arts, and, sciences, becoming, depraved, to, malevolent, or, luxurious, purposes, and, the, like, for, the, same, can, be, said, of, every, worldly, good, talent, courage, strength, beauty, riches, light, itself, and, the, rest, only, let, mankind, regain, their, rights, over, nature, assigned, to, them, by, the, gift, of, god, and, obtain, that, power, whose, exercise, will, be, governed, by, right, reason, and, true, religion, but, it, is, time, for, us, to, lay, down, the, art, of, interpreting, nature, to, which, we, attribute, no, absolute, necessity, (as, if, nothing, could, be, done, without, it), nor, perfection, although, we, think, that, our, precepts, are, most, useful, and, correct, for, we, are, of, opinion, that, if, men, had, at, their, command, a, proper, history, of, nature, and, experience, and, would, apply, themselves, steadily, to, it, and, could, bind, themselves, to, two, things, 1, to, lay, aside, received, opinions, and, notions, 2, to, restrain, themselves, till, the, proper, season, from, generalization, they, might, by, the, proper, and, genuine, exertion, of, their, minds, fall, into, our, way, of, interpretation, without, the, aid, of, any, art, for, interpretation, is, the, true, and, natural, act, of, the, mind, when, all, obstacles, are, removed, certainly, however, everything, will, be, more, ready, and, better, fixed, by, our, precepts, yet, do, we, not, affirm, that, no, addition, can, be, made, to, them, on, the, contrary, considering, the, mind, in, its, connection, with, things, and, not, merely, relatively, to, its, own, powers, we, ought, to, be, persuaded, that, the, art, of, invention, can, be, made, to, grow, with, the, inventions, themselves, to, generate, and, superinduce, a, new, nature, or, new, natures, upon, a, given, body, is, the, labor, and, aim, of, human, power, while, to, discover, the, form, or, true, difference, of, a, given, nature, or, the, nature[71], to, which, such, nature, is, owing, or, source, from, which, it, emanates, (for, these, terms, approach, nearest, to, an, explanation, of, our, meaning), is, the, labor, and, discovery, of, human, knowledge, and, subordinate, to, these, primary, labors, are, two, others, of, a, secondary, nature, and, inferior, stamp, under, the, first, must, be, ranked, the, transformation, of, concrete, bodies, from, one, to, another, which, is, possible, within, certain, limits, under, the, second, the, discovery, in, every, species, of, generation, and, motion, of, the, latent, and, uninterrupted, process, from, the, manifest, efficient, and, manifest, subject, matter, up, to, the, given, form, and, a, like, discovery, of, the, latent, conformation, of, bodies, which, are, at, rest, instead, of, being, in, motion, the, unhappy, state, of, man’s, actual, knowledge, is, manifested, even, by, the, common, assertions, of, the, vulgar, it, is, rightly, laid, down, that, true, knowledge, is, that, which, is, deduced, from, causes, the, division, of, four, causes, also, is, not, amiss, matter, form, the, efficient, and, end, or, final, cause, [72], of, these, however, the, latter, is, so, far, from, being, beneficial, that, it, even, corrupts, the, sciences, except, in, the, intercourse, of, man, with, man, the, discovery, of, form, is, considered, desperate, as, for, the, efficient, cause, and, matter, (according, to, the, present, system, of, inquiry, and, the, received, opinions, concerning, them, by, which, they, are, placed, remote, from, and, without, any, latent, process, toward, form), they, are, but, desultory, and, superficial, and, of, scarcely, any, avail, to, real, and, active, knowledge, nor, are, we, unmindful, of, our, having, pointed, out, and, corrected, above, the, error, of, the, human, mind, in, assigning, the, first, qualities, of, essence, to, forms, [73], for, although, nothing, exists, in, nature, except, individual, bodies, [74], exhibiting, clear, individual, effects, according, to, particular, laws, yet, in, each, branch, of, learning, that, very, law, its, investigation, discovery, and, development, are, the, foundation, both, of, theory, and, practice, this, law, therefore, and, its, parallel, in, each, science, is, what, we, understand, by, the, term, form, [75], adopting, that, word, because, it, has, grown, into, common, use, and, is, of, familiar, occurrence, he, who, has, learned, the, cause, of, a, particular, nature, (such, as, whiteness, or, heat), in, particular, subjects, only, has, acquired, but, an, imperfect, knowledge, as, he, who, can, induce, a, certain, effect, upon, particular, substances, only, among, those, which, are, susceptible, of, it, has, acquired, but, an, imperfect, power, but, he, who, has, only, learned, the, efficient, and, material, cause, (which, causes, are, variable, and, mere, vehicles, conveying, form, to, particular, substances), may, perhaps, arrive, at, some, new, discoveries, in, matters, of, a, similar, nature, and, prepared, for, the, purpose, but, does, not, stir, the, limits, of, things, which, are, much, more, deeply, rooted, while, he, who, is, acquainted, with, forms, comprehends, the, unity, of, nature, in, substances, apparently, most, distinct, from, each, other, he, can, disclose, and, bring, forward, therefore, (though, it, has, never, yet, been, done), things, which, neither, the, vicissitudes, of, nature, nor, the, industry, of, experiment, nor, chance, itself, would, ever, have, brought, about, and, which, would, forever, have, escaped, man’s, thoughts, from, the, discovery, of, forms, therefore, results, genuine, theory, and, free, practice, although, there, is, a, most, intimate, connection, and, almost, an, identity, between, the, ways, of, human, power, and, human, knowledge, yet, on, account, of, the, pernicious, and, inveterate, habit, of, dwelling, upon, abstractions, it, is, by, far, the, safest, method, to, commence, and, build, up, the, sciences, from, those, foundations, which, bear, a, relation, to, the, practical, division, and, to, let, them, mark, out, and, limit, the, theoretical, we, must, consider, therefore, what, precepts, or, what, direction, or, guide, a, person, would, most, desire, in, order, to, generate, and, superinduce, any, nature, upon, a, given, body, and, this, not, in, abstruse, but, in, the, plainest, language, for, instance, if, a, person, should, wish, to, superinduce, the, yellow, color, of, gold, upon, silver, or, an, additional, weight, (observing, always, the, laws, of, matter), or, transparency, on, an, opaque, stone, or, tenacity, in, glass, or, vegetation, on, a, substance, which, is, not, vegetable, we, must, say), consider, what, species, of, precept, or, guide, this, person, would, prefer, and, first, he, will, doubtless, be, anxious, to, be, shown, some, method, that, will, neither, fail, in, effect, nor, deceive, him, in, the, trial, of, it, secondly, he, will, be, anxious, that, the, prescribed, method, should, not, restrict, him, and, tie, him, down, to, peculiar, means, and, certain, particular, methods, of, acting, for, he, will, perhaps, be, at, loss, and, without, the, power, or, opportunity, of, collecting, and, procuring, such, means, now, if, there, be, other, means, and, methods, (besides, those, prescribed), of, creating, such, a, nature, they, will, perhaps, be, of, such, a, kind, as, are, in, his, power, yet, by, the, confined, limits, of, the, precept, he, will, be, deprived, of, reaping, any, advantage, from, them, thirdly, he, will, be, anxious, to, be, shown, something, not, so, difficult, as, the, required, effect, itself, but, approaching, more, nearly, to, practice, we, will, lay, this, down, therefore, as, the, genuine, and, perfect, rule, of, practice, that, it, should, be, certain, free, and, preparatory, or, having, relation, to, practice, and, this, is, the, same, thing, as, the, discovery, of, a, true, form, for, the, form, of, any, nature, is, such, that, when, it, is, assigned, the, particular, nature, infallibly, follows, it, is, therefore, always, present, when, that, nature, is, present, and, universally, attests, such, presence, and, is, inherent, in, the, whole, of, it, the, same, form, is, of, such, a, character, that, if, it, be, removed, the, particular, nature, infallibly, vanishes, it, is, therefore, absent, whenever, that, nature, is, absent, and, perpetually, testifies, such, absence, and, exists, in, no, other, nature, lastly, the, true, form, is, such, that, it, deduces, the, particular, nature, from, some, source, of, essence, existing, in, many, subjects, and, more, known, (as, they, term, it), to, nature, than, the, form, itself, such, then, is, our, determination, and, rule, with, regard, to, a, genuine, and, perfect, theoretical, axiom, that, a, nature, be, found, convertible, with, a, given, nature, and, yet, such, as, to, limit, the, more, known, nature, in, the, manner, of, a, real, genus, but, these, two, rules, the, practical, and, theoretical, are, in, fact, the, same, and, that, which, is, most, useful, in, practice, is, most, correct, in, theory, but, the, rule, or, axiom, for, the, transformation, of, bodies, is, of, two, kinds, the, first, regards, the, body, as, an, aggregate, or, combination, of, simple, natures, thus, in, gold, are, united, the, following, circumstances, it, is, yellow, heavy, of, a, certain, weight, malleable, and, ductile, to, a, certain, extent, it, is, not, volatile, loses, part, of, its, substance, by, fire, melts, in, a, particular, manner, is, separated, and, dissolved, by, particular, methods, and, so, of, the, other, natures, observable, in, gold, an, axiom, therefore, of, this, kind, deduces, the, subject, from, the, forms, of, simple, natures, for, he, who, has, acquired, the, forms, and, methods, of, superinducing, yellowness, weight, ductility, stability, deliquescence, solution, and, the, like, and, their, degrees, and, modes, will, consider, and, contrive, how, to, unite, them, in, any, body, so, as, to, transform[76], it, into, gold, and, this, method, of, operating, belongs, to, primary, action, for, it, is, the, same, thing, to, produce, one, or, many, simple, natures, except, that, man, is, more, confined, and, restricted, in, his, operations, if, many, be, required, on, account, of, the, difficulty, of, uniting, many, natures, together, it, must, however, be, observed, that, this, method, of, operating, (which, considers, natures, as, simple, though, in, a, concrete, body), sets, out, from, what, is, constant, eternal, and, universal, in, nature, and, opens, such, broad, paths, to, human, power, as, the, thoughts, of, man, can, in, the, present, state, of, things, scarcely, comprehend, or, figure, to, itself, the, second, kind, of, axiom, (which, depends, on, the, discovery, of, the, latent, process), does, not, proceed, by, simple, natures, but, by, concrete, bodies, as, they, are, found, in, nature, and, in, its, usual, course, for, instance, suppose, the, inquiry, to, be, from, what, beginnings, in, what, manner, and, by, what, process, gold, or, any, metal, or, stone, is, generated, from, the, original, menstruum, or, its, elements, up, to, the, perfect, mineral, or, in, like, manner, by, what, process, plants, are, generated, from, the, first, concretion, of, juices, in, the, earth, or, from, seeds, up, to, the, perfect, plant, with, the, whole, successive, motion, and, varied, and, uninterrupted, efforts, of, nature, and, the, same, inquiry, be, made, as, to, a, regularly, deduced, system, of, the, generation, of, animals, from, coition, to, birth, and, so, on, of, other, bodies, nor, is, this, species, of, inquiry, confined, to, the, mere, generation, of, bodies, but, it, is, applicable, to, other, changes, and, labors, of, nature, for, instance, where, an, inquiry, is, made, into, the, whole, series, and, continued, operation, of, the, nutritive, process, from, the, first, reception, of, the, food, to, its, complete, assimilation, to, the, recipient, [77], or, into, the, voluntary, motion, of, animals, from, the, first, impression, of, the, imagination, and, the, continuous, effects, of, the, spirits, up, to, the, bending, and, motion, of, the, joints, or, into, the, free, motion, of, the, tongue, and, lips, and, other, accessories, which, give, utterance, to, articulate, sounds, for, all, these, investigations, relate, to, concrete, or, associated, natures, artificially, brought, together, and, take, into, consideration, certain, particular, and, special, habits, of, nature, and, not, those, fundamental, and, general, laws, which, constitute, forms, it, must, however, be, plainly, owned, that, this, method, appears, more, prompt, and, easy, and, of, greater, promise, than, the, primary, one, in, like, manner, the, operative, branch, which, answers, to, this, contemplative, branch, extends, and, advances, its, operation, from, that, which, is, usually, observed, in, nature, to, other, subjects, immediately, connected, with, it, or, not, very, remote, from, such, immediate, connection, but, the, higher, and, radical, operations, upon, nature, depend, entirely, on, the, primary, axioms, besides, even, where, man, has, not, the, means, of, acting, but, only, of, acquiring, knowledge, as, in, astronomy, (for, man, cannot, act, upon, change, or, transform, the, heavenly, bodies), the, investigation, of, facts, or, truth, as, well, as, the, knowledge, of, causes, and, coincidences, must, be, referred, to, those, primary, and, universal, axioms, that, regard, simple, natures, such, as, the, nature, of, spontaneous, rotation, attraction, or, the, magnetic, force, and, many, others, which, are, more, common, than, the, heavenly, bodies, themselves, for, let, no, one, hope, to, determine, the, question, whether, the, earth, or, heaven, revolve, in, the, diurnal, motion, unless, he, have, first, comprehended, the, nature, of, spontaneous, rotation, but, the, latent, process, of, which, we, speak, is, far, from, being, obvious, to, men’s, minds, beset, as, they, now, are, for, we, mean, not, the, measures, symptoms, or, degrees, of, any, process, which, can, be, exhibited, in, the, bodies, themselves, but, simply, a, continued, process, which, for, the, most, part, escapes, the, observation, of, the, senses, for, instance, in, all, generations, and, transformations, of, bodies, we, must, inquire, what, is, in, the, act, of, being, lost, and, escaping, what, remains, what, is, being, added, what, is, being, diluted, what, is, being, contracted, what, is, being, united, what, is, being, separated, what, is, continuous, what, is, broken, off, what, is, urging, forward, what, impedes, what, predominates, what, is, subservient, and, many, other, circumstances, nor, are, these, inquiries, again, to, be, made, in, the, mere, generation, and, transformation, of, bodies, only, but, in, all, other, alterations, and, fluctuations, we, must, in, like, manner, inquire, what, precedes, what, succeeds, what, is, quick, what, is, slow, what, produces, and, what, governs, motion, and, the, like, all, which, matters, are, unknown, and, unattempted, by, the, sciences, in, their, present, heavy, and, inactive, state, for, since, every, natural, act, is, brought, about, by, the, smallest, efforts, [78], or, at, least, such, as, are, too, small, to, strike, our, senses, let, no, one, hope, that, he, will, be, able, to, direct, or, change, nature, unless, he, have, properly, comprehended, and, observed, these, efforts, in, like, manner, the, investigation, and, discovery, of, the, latent, conformation, in, bodies, is, no, less, new, than, the, discovery, of, the, latent, process, and, form, for, we, as, yet, are, doubtless, only, admitted, to, the, antechamber, of, nature, and, do, not, prepare, an, entrance, into, her, presence-room, but, nobody, can, endue, a, given, body, with, a, new, nature, or, transform, it, successfully, and, appropriately, into, a, new, body, without, possessing, a, complete, knowledge, of, the, body, so, to, be, changed, or, transformed, for, he, will, run, into, vain, or, at, least, into, difficult, and, perverse, methods, ill, adapted, to, the, nature, of, the, body, upon, which, he, operates, clear, path, therefore, toward, this, object, also, must, be, thrown, open, and, well, supported, labor, is, well, and, usefully, bestowed, upon, the, anatomy, of, organized, bodies, such, as, those, of, men, and, animals, which, appears, to, be, a, subtile, matter, and, a, useful, examination, of, nature, the, species, of, anatomy, however, is, that, of, first, sight, open, to, the, senses, and, takes, place, only, in, organized, bodies, it, is, obvious, and, of, ready, access, when, compared, with, the, real, anatomy, of, latent, conformation, in, bodies, which, are, considered, similar, particularly, in, specific, objects, and, their, parts, as, those, of, iron, stone, and, the, similar, parts, of, plants, and, animals, as, the, root, the, leaf, the, flower, the, flesh, the, blood, and, bones, etc, yet, human, industry, has, not, completely, neglected, this, species, of, anatomy, for, we, have, an, instance, of, it, in, the, separation, of, similar, bodies, by, distillation, and, other, solutions, which, shows, the, dissimilarity, of, the, compound, by, the, union, of, the, homogeneous, parts, these, methods, are, useful, and, of, importance, to, our, inquiry, although, attended, generally, with, fallacy, for, many, natures, are, assigned, and, attributed, to, the, separate, bodies, as, if, they, had, previously, existed, in, the, compound, which, in, reality, are, recently, bestowed, and, superinduced, by, fire, and, heat, and, the, other, modes, of, separation, besides, it, is, after, all, but, a, small, part, of, the, labor, of, discovering, the, real, conformation, in, the, compound, which, is, so, subtile, and, nice, that, it, is, rather, confused, and, lost, by, the, operation, of, the, fire, than, discovered, and, brought, to, light, separation, and, solution, of, bodies, therefore, is, to, be, effected, not, by, fire, indeed, but, rather, by, reasoning, and, true, induction, with, the, assistance, of, experiment, and, by, a, comparison, with, other, bodies, and, a, reduction, to, those, simple, natures, and, their, forms, which, meet, and, are, combined, in, the, compound, and, we, must, assuredly, pass, from, vulcan, to, minerva, if, we, wish, to, bring, to, light, the, real, texture, and, conformation, of, bodies, upon, which, every, occult, and, (as, it, is, sometimes, called), specific, property, and, virtue, of, things, depends, and, whence, also, every, rule, of, powerful, change, and, transformation, is, deduced, for, instance, we, must, examine, what, spirit, is, in, every, body, [79], what, tangible, essence, whether, that, spirit, is, copious, and, exuberant, or, meagre, and, scarce, fine, or, coarse, aëriform, or, igniform, active, or, sluggish, weak, or, robust, progressive, or, retrograde, abrupt, or, continuous, agreeing, with, external, and, surrounding, objects, or, differing, from, them, etc, in, like, manner, must, we, treat, tangible, essence, (which, admits, of, as, many, distinctions, as, the, spirit), and, its, hairs, fibres, and, varied, texture, again, the, situation, of, the, spirit, in, the, corporeal, mass, its, pores, passages, veins, and, cells, and, the, rudiments, or, first, essays, of, the, organic, body, are, subject, to, the, same, examination, in, these, however, as, in, our, former, inquiries, and, therefore, in, the, whole, investigation, of, latent, conformation, the, only, genuine, and, clear, light, which, completely, dispels, all, darkness, and, subtile, difficulties, is, admitted, by, means, of, the, primary, axioms, this, method, will, not, bring, us, to, atoms, [80], which, takes, for, granted, the, vacuum, and, immutability, of, matter, (neither, of, which, hypotheses, is, correct), but, to, the, real, particles, such, as, we, discover, them, to, be, nor, is, there, any, ground, for, alarm, at, this, refinement, as, if, it, were, inexplicable, for, on, the, contrary, the, more, inquiry, is, directed, to, simple, natures, the, more, will, everything, be, placed, in, a, plain, and, perspicuous, light, since, we, transfer, our, attention, from, the, complicated, to, the, simple, from, the, incommensurable, to, the, commensurable, from, surds, to, rational, quantities, from, the, indefinite, and, vague, to, the, definite, and, certain, as, when, we, arrive, at, the, elements, of, letters, and, the, simple, tones, of, concords, the, investigation, of, nature, is, best, conducted, when, mathematics, are, applied, to, physics, again, let, none, be, alarmed, at, vast, numbers, and, fractions, for, in, calculation, it, is, as, easy, to, set, down, or, to, reflect, upon, a, thousand, as, a, unit, or, the, thousandth, part, of, an, integer, as, an, integer, itself, [81], from, the, two, kinds, of, axioms, above, specified, arise, the, two, divisions, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, and, we, will, use, the, commonly, adopted, terms, which, approach, the, nearest, to, our, meaning, in, our, own, sense, let, the, investigation, of, forms, which, (in, reasoning, at, least, and, after, their, own, laws), are, eternal, and, immutable, constitute, metaphysics, [82], and, let, the, investigation, of, the, efficient, cause, of, matter, latent, process, and, latent, conformation, (which, all, relate, merely, to, the, ordinary, course, of, nature, and, not, to, her, fundamental, and, eternal, laws), constitute, physics, parallel, to, these, let, there, be, two, practical, divisions, to, physics, that, of, mechanics, and, to, metaphysics, that, of, magic, in, the, purest, sense, of, the, term, as, applied, to, its, ample, means, and, its, command, over, nature, the, object, of, our, philosophy, being, thus, laid, down, we, proceed, to, precepts, in, the, most, clear, and, regular, order, the, signs, for, the, interpretation, of, nature, comprehend, two, divisions, the, first, regards, the, eliciting, or, creating, of, axioms, from, experiment, the, second, the, deducing, or, deriving, of, new, experiments, from, axioms, the, first, admits, of, three, subdivisions, into, ministrations, 1, to, the, senses, 2, to, the, memory, 3, to, the, mind, or, reason, for, we, must, first, prepare, as, a, foundation, for, the, whole, a, complete, and, accurate, natural, and, experimental, history, we, must, not, imagine, or, invent, but, discover, the, acts, and, properties, of, nature, but, natural, and, experimental, history, is, so, varied, and, diffuse, that, it, confounds, and, distracts, the, understanding, unless, it, be, fixed, and, exhibited, in, due, order, we, must, therefore, form, tables, and, co-ordinations, of, instances, upon, such, a, plan, and, in, such, order, that, the, understanding, may, be, enabled, to, act, upon, them, even, when, this, is, done, the, understanding, left, to, itself, and, to, its, own, operation, is, incompetent, and, unfit, to, construct, its, axioms, without, direction, and, support, our, third, ministration, therefore, must, be, true, and, legitimate, induction, the, very, key, of, interpretation, we, must, begin, however, at, the, end, and, go, back, again, to, the, others, the, investigation, of, forms, proceeds, thus, a, nature, being, given, we, must, first, present, to, the, understanding, all, the, known, instances, which, agree, in, the, same, nature, although, the, subject, matter, be, considerably, diversified, and, this, collection, must, be, made, as, a, mere, history, and, without, any, premature, reflection, or, too, great, degree, of, refinement, for, instance, take, the, investigation, of, the, form, of, heat, _instances, agreeing, in, the, form, of, heat_, the, rays, of, the, sun, particularly, in, summer, and, at, noon, the, same, reflected, and, condensed, as, between, mountains, or, along, walls, and, particularly, in, burning, mirrors, ignited, meteors, burning, lightning, eruptions, of, flames, from, the, cavities, of, mountains, etc, flame, of, every, kind, ignited, solids, natural, warm, baths, warm, or, heated, liquids, warm, vapors, and, smoke, and, the, air, itself, which, admits, a, most, powerful, and, violent, heat, if, confined, as, in, reverberating, furnaces, damp, hot, weather, arising, from, the, constitution, of, the, air, without, any, reference, to, the, time, of, the, year, confined, and, subterraneous, air, in, some, caverns, particularly, in, winter, all, shaggy, substances, as, wool, the, skins, of, animals, and, the, plumage, of, birds, contain, some, heat, all, bodies, both, solid, and, liquid, dense, and, rare, (as, the, air, itself), placed, near, fire, for, any, time, sparks, arising, from, the, violent, percussion, of, flint, and, steel, all, bodies, rubbed, violently, as, stone, wood, cloth, etc, so, that, rudders, and, axles, of, wheels, sometimes, catch, fire, and, the, west, indians, obtain, fire, by, attrition, green, and, moist, vegetable, matter, confined, and, rubbed, together, as, roses, peas, in, baskets, so, hay, if, it, be, damp, when, stacked, often, catches, fire, quicklime, sprinkled, with, water, iron, when, first, dissolved, by, acids, in, a, glass, and, without, any, application, to, fire, the, same, of, tin, but, not, so, intensely, animals, particularly, internally, although, the, heat, is, not, perceivable, by, the, touch, in, insects, on, account, of, their, small, size, horse, dung, and, the, like, excrement, from, other, animals, when, fresh, strong, oil, of, sulphur, and, of, vitriol, exhibit, the, operation, of, heat, in, burning, linen, as, does, the, oil, of, marjoram, and, like, substances, in, burning, the, bony, substance, of, the, teeth, strong, and, well, rectified, spirits, of, wine, exhibit, the, same, effects, so, that, white, of, eggs, when, thrown, into, it, grows, hard, and, white, almost, in, the, same, manner, as, when, boiled, and, bread, becomes, burned, and, brown, as, if, toasted, aromatic, substances, and, warm, plants, as, the, dracunculus, [arum], old, nasturtium, etc, which, though, they, be, not, warm, to, the, touch, (whether, whole, or, pulverized), yet, are, discovered, by, the, tongue, and, palate, to, be, warm, and, almost, burning, when, slightly, masticated, strong, vinegar, and, all, acids, on, any, part, of, the, body, not, clothed, with, the, epidermis, as, the, eye, tongue, or, any, wounded, part, or, where, the, skin, is, removed, excite, a, pain, differing, but, little, from, that, produced, by, heat, even, a, severe, and, intense, cold, produces, a, sensation, of, burning, [83], “nec, boreæ, penetrabile, frigus, adurit, ”, other, instances, we, are, wont, to, call, this, a, table, of, existence, and, presence, we, must, next, present, to, the, understanding, instances, which, do, not, admit, of, the, given, nature, for, form, (as, we, have, observed), ought, no, less, to, be, absent, where, the, given, nature, is, absent, than, to, be, present, where, it, is, present, if, however, we, were, to, examine, every, instance, our, labor, would, be, infinite, negatives, therefore, must, be, classed, under, the, affirmatives, and, the, want, of, the, given, nature, must, be, inquired, into, more, particularly, in, objects, which, have, a, very, close, connection, with, those, others, in, which, it, is, present, and, manifest, and, this, we, are, wont, to, term, a, table, of, deviation, or, of, absence, in, proximity, _proximate, instances, wanting, the, nature, of, heat_, the, rays, of, the, moon, stars, and, comets, are, not, found, to, be, warm, to, the, touch, nay, the, severest, cold, has, been, observed, to, take, place, at, the, full, of, the, moon, yet, the, larger, fixed, stars, are, supposed, to, increase, and, render, more, intense, the, heat, of, the, sun, as, he, approaches, them, when, the, sun, is, in, the, sign, of, the, lion, for, instance, and, in, the, dog-days, [84], the, rays, of, the, sun, in, what, is, called, the, middle, region, of, the, air, give, no, heat, to, account, for, which, the, commonly, assigned, reason, is, satisfactory, namely, that, that, region, is, neither, sufficiently, near, to, the, body, of, the, sun, whence, the, rays, emanate, nor, to, the, earth, whence, they, are, reflected, and, the, fact, is, manifested, by, snow, being, perpetual, on, the, tops, of, mountains, unless, extremely, lofty, but, it, is, observed, on, the, other, hand, by, some, that, at, the, peak, of, teneriffe, and, also, among, the, andes, of, peru, the, tops, of, the, mountains, are, free, from, snow, which, only, lies, in, the, lower, part, as, you, ascend, besides, the, air, on, the, summit, of, these, mountains, is, found, to, be, by, no, means, cold, but, only, thin, and, sharp, so, much, so, that, in, the, andes, it, pricks, and, hurts, the, eyes, from, its, extreme, sharpness, and, even, excites, the, orifice, of, the, stomach, and, produces, vomiting, the, ancients, also, observed, that, the, rarity, of, the, air, on, the, summit, of, olympus, was, such, that, those, who, ascended, it, were, obliged, to, carry, sponges, moistened, with, vinegar, and, water, and, to, apply, them, now, and, then, to, their, nostrils, as, the, air, was, not, dense, enough, for, their, respiration, on, the, summit, of, which, mountain, it, is, also, related, there, reigned, so, great, a, serenity, and, calm, free, from, rain, snow, or, wind, that, the, letters, traced, upon, the, ashes, of, the, sacrifices, on, the, altar, of, jupiter, by, the, fingers, of, those, who, had, offered, them, would, remain, undisturbed, till, the, next, year, those, even, who, at, this, day, go, to, the, top, of, the, peak, of, teneriffe, walk, by, night, and, not, in, the, daytime, and, are, advised, and, pressed, by, their, guides, as, soon, as, the, sun, rises, to, make, haste, in, their, descent, on, account, of, the, danger, (apparently, arising, from, the, rarity, of, the, atmosphere), lest, their, breathing, should, be, relaxed, and, suffocated, [85], the, reflection, of, the, solar, rays, in, the, polar, regions, is, found, to, be, weak, and, inefficient, in, producing, heat, so, that, the, dutch, who, wintered, in, nova, zembla, and, expected, that, their, vessel, would, be, freed, about, the, beginning, of, july, from, the, obstruction, of, the, mass, of, ice, which, had, blocked, it, up, were, disappointed, and, obliged, to, embark, in, their, boat, hence, the, direct, rays, of, the, sun, appear, to, have, but, little, power, even, on, the, plain, and, when, reflected, unless, they, are, multiplied, and, condensed, which, takes, place, when, the, sun, tends, more, to, the, perpendicular, for, then, the, incidence, of, the, rays, occurs, at, more, acute, angles, so, that, the, reflected, rays, are, nearer, to, each, other, while, on, the, contrary, when, the, sun, is, in, a, very, oblique, position, the, angles, of, incidence, are, very, obtuse, and, the, reflected, rays, at, a, greater, distance, in, the, meantime, it, must, be, observed, that, there, may, be, many, operations, of, the, solar, rays, relating, too, to, the, nature, of, heat, which, are, not, proportioned, to, our, touch, so, that, with, regard, to, us, they, do, not, tend, to, produce, warmth, but, with, regard, to, some, other, bodies, have, their, due, effect, in, producing, it, let, the, following, experiment, be, made, take, a, lens, the, reverse, of, a, burning-glass, and, place, it, between, the, hand, and, the, solar, rays, and, observe, whether, it, diminish, the, heat, of, the, sun, as, a, burning-glass, increases, it, for, it, is, clear, with, regard, to, the, visual, rays, that, in, proportion, as, the, lens, is, made, of, unequal, thickness, in, the, middle, and, at, its, sides, the, images, appear, either, more, diffused, or, contracted, it, should, be, seen, therefore, if, the, same, be, true, with, regard, to, heat, let, the, experiment, be, well, tried, whether, the, lunar, rays, can, be, received, and, collected, by, the, strongest, and, best, burning-glasses, so, as, to, produce, even, the, least, degree, of, heat, [86], but, if, that, degree, be, perhaps, so, subtile, and, weak, as, not, to, be, perceived, or, ascertained, by, the, touch, we, must, have, recourse, to, those, glasses, which, indicate, the, warm, or, cold, state, of, the, atmosphere, and, let, the, lunar, rays, fall, through, the, burning-glass, on, the, top, of, this, thermometer, and, then, notice, if, the, water, be, depressed, by, the, heat, [87], let, the, burning-glass, be, tried, on, warm, objects, which, emit, no, luminous, rays, as, heated, but, not, ignited, iron, or, stone, or, hot, water, or, the, like, and, observe, whether, the, heat, become, increased, and, condensed, as, happens, with, the, solar, rays, let, it, be, tried, on, common, flame, the, effect, of, comets, (if, we, can, reckon, them, among, meteors[88]), in, augmenting, the, heat, of, the, season, is, not, found, to, be, constant, or, clear, although, droughts, have, generally, been, observed, to, follow, them, however, luminous, lines, and, pillars, and, openings, and, the, like, appear, more, often, in, winter, than, in, summer, and, especially, with, the, most, intense, cold, but, joined, with, drought, lightning, and, coruscations, and, thunder, however, rarely, happen, in, winter, and, generally, at, the, time, of, the, greatest, heats, the, appearances, we, term, falling, stars, are, generally, supposed, to, consist, of, some, shining, and, inflamed, viscous, substance, rather, than, of, violently, hot, matter, but, let, this, be, further, investigated, some, coruscations, emit, light, without, burning, but, are, never, accompanied, by, thunder, eructations, and, eruptions, of, flame, are, to, be, found, in, cold, climates, as, well, as, in, hot, as, in, iceland, and, greenland, just, as, the, trees, of, cold, countries, are, sometimes, inflammable, and, more, pitchy, and, resinous, than, in, warm, as, the, fir, pine, and, the, like, but, the, position, and, nature, of, the, soil, where, such, eruptions, are, wont, to, happen, is, not, yet, sufficiently, investigated, to, enable, us, to, subjoin, a, negative, instance, to, the, affirmative, all, flame, is, constantly, more, or, less, warm, and, this, instance, is, not, altogether, negative, yet, it, is, said, that, the, ignis, fatuus, (as, it, is, called), and, which, sometimes, is, driven, against, walls, has, but, little, heat, perhaps, it, resembles, that, of, spirits, of, wine, which, is, mild, and, gentle, that, flame, however, appears, yet, milder, which, in, some, well, authenticated, and, serious, histories, is, said, to, have, appeared, round, the, head, and, hair, of, boys, and, virgins, and, instead, of, burning, their, hair, merely, to, have, played, about, it, and, it, is, most, certain, that, a, sort, of, flash, without, any, evident, heat, has, sometimes, been, seen, about, a, horse, when, sweating, at, night, or, in, damp, weather, it, is, also, a, well, known, fact, [89], and, it, was, almost, considered, as, a, miracle, that, a, few, years, since, a, girl’s, apron, sparkled, when, a, little, shaken, or, rubbed, which, was, perhaps, occasioned, by, the, alum, or, salts, with, which, the, apron, was, imbued, and, which, after, having, been, stuck, together, and, incrusted, rather, strongly, were, broken, by, the, friction, it, is, well, known, that, all, sugar, whether, candied, or, plain, if, it, be, hard, will, sparkle, when, broken, or, scraped, in, the, dark, in, like, manner, sea, and, salt, water, is, sometimes, found, to, shine, at, night, when, struck, violently, by, the, oar, the, foam, of, the, sea, when, agitated, by, tempests, also, sparkles, at, night, and, the, spaniards, call, this, appearance, the, sea’s, lungs, it, has, not, been, sufficiently, ascertained, what, degree, of, heat, attends, the, flame, which, the, ancient, sailors, called, castor, and, pollux, and, the, moderns, call, st, ermus’, fire, every, ignited, body, that, is, red-hot, is, always, warm, although, without, flame, nor, is, any, negative, instance, subjoined, to, this, affirmative, rotten, wood, however, approaches, nearly, to, it, for, it, shines, at, night, and, yet, is, not, found, to, be, warm, and, the, putrefying, scales, of, fish, which, shine, in, the, same, manner, are, not, warm, to, the, touch, nor, the, body, of, the, glowworm, or, of, the, fly, called, lucciola, [90], the, situation, and, nature, of, the, soil, of, natural, warm, baths, has, not, been, sufficiently, investigated, and, therefore, a, negative, instance, is, not, subjoined, to, the, instances, of, warm, liquids, we, may, subjoin, the, negative, one, of, the, peculiar, nature, of, liquids, in, general, for, no, tangible, liquid, is, known, that, is, at, once, warm, in, its, nature, and, constantly, continues, warm, but, their, heat, is, only, superinduced, as, an, adventitious, nature, for, a, limited, time, so, that, those, which, are, extremely, warm, in, their, power, and, effect, as, spirits, of, wine, chemical, aromatic, oils, the, oils, of, vitriol, and, sulphur, and, the, like, and, which, speedily, burn, are, yet, cold, at, first, to, the, touch, and, the, water, of, natural, baths, poured, into, any, vessel, and, separated, from, its, source, cools, down, like, water, heated, by, the, fire, it, is, however, true, that, oily, substances, are, rather, less, cold, to, the, touch, than, those, that, are, aqueous, oil, for, instance, than, water, silk, than, linen, but, this, belongs, to, the, table, of, degrees, of, cold, in, like, manner, we, may, subjoin, a, negative, instance, to, that, of, warm, vapor, derived, from, the, nature, of, vapor, itself, as, far, as, we, are, acquainted, with, it, for, exhalations, from, oily, substances, though, easily, inflammable, are, yet, never, warm, unless, recently, exhaled, from, some, warm, substance, the, same, may, be, said, of, the, instance, of, air, for, we, never, perceive, that, air, is, warm, unless, confined, or, pressed, or, manifestly, heated, by, the, sun, by, fire, or, some, other, warm, body, negative, instance, is, exhibited, in, weather, by, its, coldness, with, an, east, or, north, wind, beyond, what, the, season, would, lead, us, to, expect, just, as, the, contrary, takes, place, with, the, south, or, west, winds, an, inclination, to, rain, (especially, in, winter), attends, warm, weather, and, to, frost, cold, weather, negative, instance, as, to, air, confined, in, caverns, may, be, observed, in, summer, indeed, we, should, make, a, more, diligent, inquiry, into, the, nature, of, confined, air, for, in, the, first, place, the, qualities, of, air, in, its, own, nature, with, regard, to, heat, and, cold, may, reasonably, be, the, subject, of, doubt, for, air, evidently, derives, its, heat, from, the, effects, of, celestial, bodies, and, possibly, its, cold, from, the, exhalation, of, the, earth, and, in, the, mid, region, of, air, (as, it, is, termed), from, cold, vapors, and, snow, so, that, no, judgment, can, be, formed, of, the, nature, of, air, by, that, which, is, out, of, doors, and, exposed, but, a, more, correct, one, might, be, derived, from, confined, air, it, is, necessary, however, that, the, air, should, be, inclosed, in, a, vessel, of, such, materials, as, would, not, imbue, it, with, heat, or, cold, of, themselves, nor, easily, admit, the, influence, of, the, external, atmosphere, the, experiment, should, be, made, therefore, with, an, earthen, jar, covered, with, folds, of, leather, to, protect, it, from, the, external, air, and, the, air, should, be, kept, three, or, four, days, in, this, vessel, well, closed, on, opening, the, jar, the, degree, of, heat, may, be, ascertained, either, by, the, hand, or, a, graduated, glass, tube, there, is, a, similar, doubt, as, to, whether, the, warmth, of, wool, skins, feathers, and, the, like, is, derived, from, a, slight, inherent, heat, since, they, are, animal, excretions, or, from, their, being, of, a, certain, fat, and, oily, nature, that, accords, with, heat, or, merely, from, the, confinement, and, separation, of, air, which, we, spoke, of, in, the, preceding, paragraph, [91], for, all, air, appears, to, possess, a, certain, degree, of, warmth, when, separated, from, the, external, atmosphere, let, an, experiment, be, made, therefore, with, fibrous, substances, of, linen, and, not, of, wool, feathers, or, silk, which, are, animal, excretions, for, it, is, to, be, observed, that, all, powders, (where, air, is, manifestly, inclosed), are, less, cold, than, the, substances, when, whole, just, as, we, imagine, froth, (which, contains, air), to, be, less, cold, than, the, liquid, itself, we, have, here, no, exactly, negative, instance, for, we, are, not, acquainted, with, any, body, tangible, or, spirituous, which, does, not, admit, of, heat, when, exposed, to, the, fire, there, is, however, this, difference, that, some, admit, it, more, rapidly, as, air, oil, and, water, others, more, slowly, as, stone, and, metals, [92], this, however, belongs, to, the, table, of, degrees, no, negative, is, here, subjoined, except, the, remark, that, sparks, are, not, kindled, by, flint, and, steel, or, any, other, hard, substance, unless, some, small, particles, of, the, stone, or, metal, are, struck, off, and, that, the, air, never, forms, them, by, friction, as, is, commonly, supposed, besides, the, sparks, from, the, weight, of, the, ignited, substance, have, a, tendency, to, descend, rather, than, to, rise, and, when, extinguished, become, a, sort, of, dark, ash, we, are, of, opinion, that, here, again, there, is, no, negative, for, we, are, not, acquainted, with, any, tangible, body, which, does, not, become, decidedly, warm, by, friction, so, that, the, ancients, feigned, that, the, gods, had, no, other, means, or, power, of, creating, heat, than, the, friction, of, air, by, rapid, and, violent, rotation, on, this, point, however, further, inquiry, must, be, made, whether, bodies, projected, by, machines, (as, balls, from, cannon), do, not, derive, some, degree, of, heat, from, meeting, the, air, which, renders, them, somewhat, warm, when, they, fall, the, air, in, motion, rather, cools, than, heats, as, in, the, winds, the, bellows, or, breath, when, the, mouth, is, contracted, the, motion, however, in, such, instances, is, not, sufficiently, rapid, to, excite, heat, and, is, applied, to, a, body, of, air, and, not, to, its, component, parts, so, that, it, is, not, surprising, that, heat, should, not, be, generated, we, must, make, a, more, diligent, inquiry, into, this, instance, for, herbs, and, green, and, moist, vegetables, appear, to, possess, a, latent, heat, so, small, however, as, not, to, be, perceived, by, the, touch, in, single, specimens, but, when, they, are, united, and, confined, so, that, their, spirit, cannot, exhale, into, the, air, and, they, rather, warm, each, other, their, heat, is, at, once, manifested, and, even, flame, occasionally, in, suitable, substances, here, too, we, must, make, a, more, diligent, inquiry, for, quicklime, when, sprinkled, with, water, appears, to, conceive, heat, either, from, its, being, collected, into, one, point, (as, we, observed, of, herbs, when, confined), or, from, the, irritation, and, exasperation, of, the, fiery, spirit, by, water, which, occasions, a, conflict, and, struggle, the, true, reason, will, more, readily, be, shown, if, oil, be, used, instead, of, water, for, oil, will, equally, tend, to, collect, the, confined, spirit, but, not, to, irritate, the, experiment, may, be, made, more, general, both, by, using, the, ashes, and, calcined, products, of, different, bodies, and, by, pouring, different, liquids, upon, them, negative, instance, may, be, subjoined, of, other, metals, which, are, more, soft, and, soluble, for, leaf, gold, dissolved, by, aqua, regia, or, lead, by, aqua, fortis, are, not, warm, to, the, touch, while, dissolving, no, more, is, quicksilver, (as, far, as, remember), but, silver, excites, a, slight, heat, and, so, does, copper, and, tin, yet, more, plainly, and, most, of, all, iron, and, steel, which, excite, not, only, a, powerful, heat, but, a, violent, bubbling, the, heat, therefore, appears, to, be, occasioned, by, the, struggle, which, takes, place, when, these, strong, dissolvents, penetrate, dig, into, and, tear, asunder, the, parts, of, those, substances, while, the, substances, themselves, resist, when, however, the, substances, yield, more, easily, scarcely, any, heat, is, excited, there, is, no, negative, instance, with, regard, to, the, heat, of, animals, except, in, insects, (as, has, been, observed), owing, to, their, small, size, for, in, fishes, as, compared, with, land, animals, a, lower, degree, rather, than, a, deprivation, of, heat, is, observable, in, plants, and, vegetables, both, as, to, their, exudations, and, pith, when, freshly, exposed, there, is, no, sensible, degree, of, heat, but, in, animals, there, is, a, great, difference, in, the, degree, both, in, particular, parts, (for, the, heat, varies, near, the, heart, the, brain, and, the, extremities), and, in, the, circumstances, in, which, they, are, placed, such, as, violent, exercise, and, fevers, here, again, there, is, scarcely, a, negative, instance, might, add, that, the, excrements, of, animals, even, when, they, are, no, longer, fresh, possess, evidently, some, effective, heat, as, is, shown, by, their, enriching, the, soil, such, liquids, (whether, oily, or, watery), as, are, intensely, acrid, exhibit, the, effects, of, heat, by, the, separation, and, burning, of, bodies, after, some, little, action, upon, them, yet, they, are, not, at, first, warm, to, the, touch, but, they, act, according, to, their, affinity, and, the, pores, of, the, substances, to, which, they, are, applied, for, aqua, regia, dissolves, gold, but, not, silver--on, the, contrary, aqua, fortis, dissolves, silver, but, not, gold, neither, of, them, dissolves, glass, and, so, of, the, rest, let, spirits, of, wine, be, tried, on, wood, or, butter, wax, or, pitch, to, see, if, this, will, melt, them, at, all, by, their, heat, for, the, twenty-fourth, instance, shows, that, they, possess, properties, resembling, those, of, heat, in, causing, incrustation, let, an, experiment, also, be, made, with, a, graduated, glass, or, calendar, [93], concave, at, the, top, by, pouring, well-rectified, spirits, of, wine, into, the, cavity, and, covering, it, up, in, order, that, they, may, the, better, retain, their, heat, then, observe, whether, their, heat, make, the, water, descend, spices, and, acrid, herbs, are, sensibly, warm, to, the, palate, and, still, more, so, when, taken, internally, one, should, see, therefore, on, what, other, substances, they, exhibit, the, effects, of, heat, now, sailors, tell, us, that, when, large, quantities, of, spices, are, suddenly, opened, after, having, been, shut, up, for, some, time, there, is, some, danger, of, fever, and, inflammation, to, those, who, stir, them, or, take, them, out, an, experiment, might, therefore, be, made, whether, such, spices, and, herbs, when, produced, will, like, smoke, dry, fish, and, meat, hung, up, over, them, there, is, an, acrid, effect, and, a, degree, of, penetration, in, cold, liquids, such, as, vinegar, and, oil, of, vitriol, as, well, as, in, warm, such, as, oil, of, marjoram, and, the, like, they, have, therefore, an, equal, effect, in, causing, animated, substances, to, smart, and, separating, and, consuming, inanimate, parts, there, is, not, any, negative, instance, as, to, this, nor, does, there, exist, any, animal, pain, unaccompanied, by, the, sensation, of, heat, there, are, many, effects, common, to, cold, and, heat, however, different, in, their, process, for, snowballs, appear, to, burn, boys’, hands, after, a, little, time, and, cold, no, less, than, fire, preserves, bodies, from, putrefaction--besides, both, heat, and, cold, contract, bodies, but, it, is, better, to, refer, these, instances, and, the, like, to, the, investigation, of, cold, in, the, third, place, we, must, exhibit, to, the, understanding, the, instances, in, which, that, nature, which, is, the, object, of, our, inquiries, is, present, in, a, greater, or, less, degree, either, by, comparing, its, increase, and, decrease, in, the, same, object, or, its, degree, in, different, objects, for, since, the, form, of, a, thing, is, its, very, essence, and, the, thing, only, differs, from, its, form, as, the, apparent, from, the, actual, object, or, the, exterior, from, the, interior, or, that, which, is, considered, with, relation, to, man, from, that, which, is, considered, with, relation, to, the, universe, it, necessarily, follows, that, no, nature, can, be, considered, a, real, form, which, does, not, uniformly, diminish, and, increase, with, the, given, nature, we, are, wont, to, call, this, our, table, of, degrees, or, comparative, instances, _table, of, the, degrees, or, comparative, instances, of, heat_, we, will, first, speak, of, those, bodies, which, exhibit, no, degree, of, heat, sensible, to, the, touch, but, appear, rather, to, possess, a, potential, heat, or, disposition, and, preparation, for, it, we, will, then, go, on, to, others, which, are, actually, warm, to, the, touch, and, observe, the, strength, and, degree, of, it, there, is, no, known, solid, or, tangible, body, which, is, by, its, own, nature, originally, warm, for, neither, stone, metal, sulphur, fossils, wood, water, nor, dead, animal, carcasses, are, found, warm, the, warm, springs, in, baths, appear, to, be, heated, accidentally, by, flame, subterraneous, fire, (such, as, is, thrown, up, by, etna, and, many, other, mountains), or, by, the, contact, of, certain, bodies, as, heat, is, exhibited, in, the, dissolution, of, iron, and, tin, the, degree, of, heat, therefore, in, inanimate, objects, is, not, sensible, to, our, touch, but, they, differ, in, their, degrees, of, cold, for, wood, and, metal, are, not, equally, cold, [94], this, however, belongs, to, the, table, of, degrees, of, cold, but, with, regard, to, potential, heat, and, predisposition, to, flame, we, find, many, inanimate, substances, wonderfully, adapted, to, it, as, sulphur, naphtha, and, saltpetre, bodies, which, have, previously, acquired, heat, as, horse, dung, from, the, animal, or, lime, and, perhaps, ashes, and, soot, from, fire, retain, some, latent, portion, of, it, hence, distillations, and, separations, of, substances, are, effected, by, burying, them, in, horse, dung, and, heat, is, excited, in, lime, by, sprinkling, it, with, water, (as, has, been, before, observed), in, the, vegetable, world, we, know, of, no, plant, nor, part, of, any, plant, (as, the, exudations, or, pith), that, is, warm, to, man’s, touch, yet, (as, we, have, before, observed), green, weeds, grow, warm, when, confined, and, some, vegetables, are, warm, and, others, cold, to, our, internal, touch, _i, e, _, the, palate, and, stomach, or, even, after, a, while, to, our, external, skin, (as, is, shown, in, plasters, and, ointments), we, know, of, nothing, in, the, various, parts, of, animals, when, dead, or, detached, from, the, rest, that, is, warm, to, the, touch, for, horse, dung, itself, does, not, retain, its, heat, unless, it, be, confined, and, buried, all, dung, however, appears, to, possess, a, potential, heat, as, in, manuring, fields, so, also, dead, bodies, are, endued, with, this, latent, and, potential, heat, to, such, a, degree, that, in, cemeteries, where, people, are, interred, daily, the, earth, acquires, a, secret, heat, which, consumes, any, recently, deposited, body, much, sooner, than, pure, earth, and, they, tell, you, that, the, people, of, the, east, are, acquainted, with, a, fine, soft, cloth, made, of, the, down, of, birds, which, can, melt, butter, wrapped, gently, up, in, it, by, its, own, warmth, manures, such, as, every, kind, of, dung, chalk, sea-sand, salt, and, the, like, have, some, disposition, toward, heat, all, putrefaction, exhibits, some, slight, degree, of, heat, though, not, enough, to, be, perceptible, by, the, touch, for, neither, the, substances, which, by, putrefaction, are, converted, into, animalculæ, [95], as, flesh, and, cheese, nor, rotten, wood, which, shines, in, the, dark, are, warm, to, the, touch, the, heat, however, of, putrid, substances, displays, itself, occasionally, in, a, disgusting, and, strong, scent, the, first, degree, of, heat, therefore, in, substances, which, are, warm, to, the, human, touch, appears, to, be, that, of, animals, and, this, admits, of, a, great, variety, of, degrees, for, the, lowest, (as, in, insects), is, scarcely, perceptible, the, highest, scarcely, equals, that, of, the, sun’s, rays, in, warm, climates, and, weather, and, is, not, so, acute, as, to, be, insufferable, to, the, hand, it, is, said, however, of, constantius, and, some, others, of, a, very, dry, constitution, and, habit, of, body, that, when, attacked, with, violent, fevers, they, became, so, warm, as, to, appear, almost, to, burn, the, hand, applied, to, them, animals, become, more, warm, by, motion, and, exercise, wine, and, feasting, venery, burning, fevers, and, grief, in, the, paroxysm, of, intermittent, fevers, the, patients, are, at, first, seized, with, cold, and, shivering, but, soon, afterward, become, more, heated, than, at, first--in, burning, and, pestilential, fevers, they, are, hot, from, the, beginning, let, further, inquiry, be, made, into, the, comparative, heat, of, different, animals, as, fishes, quadrupeds, serpents, birds, and, also, of, the, different, species, as, the, lion, the, kite, or, man, for, according, to, the, vulgar, opinion, fishes, are, the, least, warm, internally, and, birds, the, most, particularly, doves, hawks, and, ostriches, let, further, inquiry, be, made, as, to, the, comparative, heat, in, different, parts, and, limbs, of, the, same, animal, for, milk, blood, seed, and, eggs, are, moderately, warm, and, less, hot, than, the, outward, flesh, of, the, animal, when, in, motion, or, agitated, the, degree, of, heat, of, the, brain, stomach, heart, and, the, rest, has, not, yet, been, equally, well, investigated, all, animals, are, externally, cold, in, winter, and, cold, weather, but, are, thought, to, be, internally, warmer, the, heat, of, the, heavenly, bodies, even, in, the, warmest, climates, and, seasons, never, reaches, such, a, pitch, as, to, light, or, burn, the, driest, wood, or, straw, or, even, tinder, without, the, aid, of, burning-glasses, it, can, however, raise, vapor, from, moist, substances, astronomers, tell, us, that, some, stars, are, hotter, than, others, mars, is, considered, the, warmest, after, the, sun, then, jupiter, then, venus, the, moon, and, above, all, saturn, are, considered, to, be, cold, among, the, fixed, stars, sirius, is, thought, the, warmest, then, cor, leonis, or, regulus, then, the, lesser, dog-star, the, sun, gives, out, more, heat, as, it, approaches, toward, the, perpendicular, or, zenith, which, may, be, supposed, to, be, the, case, with, the, other, planets, according, to, their, degree, of, heat, for, instance, that, jupiter, gives, out, more, heat, when, situated, beneath, cancer, or, leo, than, when, he, is, beneath, capricorn, and, aquarius, it, is, to, be, supposed, that, the, sun, and, other, planets, give, more, heat, in, perigee, from, their, approximation, to, the, earth, than, when, in, apogee, but, if, in, any, country, the, sun, should, be, both, in, its, perigee, and, nearer, to, the, perpendicular, at, the, same, time, it, must, necessarily, give, out, more, heat, than, in, a, country, where, it, is, also, in, perigee, but, situated, more, obliquely, so, that, the, comparative, altitude, of, the, planets, should, be, observed, and, their, approach, to, or, declination, from, the, perpendicular, in, different, countries, the, sun, and, other, planets, are, thought, also, to, give, out, more, heat, in, proportion, as, they, are, nearer, to, the, larger, fixed, stars, as, when, the, sun, is, in, leo, he, is, nearer, cor, leonis, cauda, leonis, spica, virginis, sirius, and, the, lesser, dog-star, than, when, he, is, in, cancer, where, however, he, approaches, nearer, to, the, perpendicular, it, is, probable, also, that, the, quarters, of, the, heavens, produce, a, greater, heat, (though, not, perceptibly), in, proportion, as, they, are, adorned, with, a, greater, number, of, stars, particularly, those, of, the, first, magnitude, on, the, whole, the, heat, of, the, heavenly, bodies, is, augmented, in, three, ways, 1, the, approach, to, the, perpendicular, 2, proximity, or, their, perigee, 3, the, conjunction, or, union, of, stars, there, is, a, very, considerable, difference, between, the, degree, of, heat, in, animals, and, even, in, the, rays, of, the, heavenly, bodies, (as, they, reach, us), and, the, heat, of, the, most, gentle, flame, and, even, of, all, ignited, substances, nay, liquids, or, the, air, itself, when, unusually, heated, by, fire, for, the, flame, of, spirit, of, wine, though, diffused, and, uncollected, is, yet, able, to, set, straw, linen, or, paper, on, fire, which, animal, heat, or, that, of, the, sun, will, never, accomplish, without, a, burning-glass, there, are, however, many, degrees, of, strength, and, weakness, in, flame, and, ignited, bodies, but, no, diligent, inquiry, has, been, made, in, this, respect, and, we, must, therefore, pass, it, hastily, over, of, all, flames, that, of, spirits, of, wine, appears, to, be, the, most, gentle, except, perhaps, the, ignis, fatuus, or, the, flashes, from, the, perspiration, of, animals, after, this, we, should, be, inclined, to, place, the, flame, of, light, and, porous, vegetables, such, as, straw, reeds, and, dried, leaves, from, which, the, flame, of, hair, or, feathers, differs, but, little, then, perhaps, comes, the, flame, of, wood, particularly, that, which, contains, but, little, rosin, or, pitch, that, of, small, wood, however, (such, as, is, usually, tied, up, in, fagots), is, milder, than, that, of, the, trunks, or, roots, of, trees, this, can, be, easily, tried, in, iron, furnaces, where, a, fire, of, fagots, or, branches, of, trees, is, of, little, service, next, follows, the, flame, of, oil, tallow, wax, and, the, like, oily, and, fat, substances, which, are, not, very, violent, but, a, most, powerful, heat, is, found, in, pitch, and, rosin, and, a, still, greater, in, sulphur, camphor, naphtha, saltpetre, and, salts, (after, they, have, discharged, their, crude, matter), and, in, their, compounds, as, in, gunpowder, greek, fire, (vulgarly, called, wild, fire), and, its, varieties, which, possess, such, a, stubborn, heat, as, scarcely, to, be, extinguished, by, water, we, consider, that, the, flame, which, results, from, some, imperfect, metals, is, very, strong, and, active, but, on, all, these, points, further, inquiry, should, be, made, the, flame, of, vivid, lightning, appears, to, exceed, all, the, above, so, as, sometimes, to, have, melted, even, wrought, iron, into, drops, which, the, other, flames, cannot, accomplish, in, ignited, bodies, there, are, different, degrees, of, heat, concerning, which, also, a, diligent, inquiry, has, not, been, made, we, consider, the, faintest, heat, to, be, that, of, tinder, touchwood, and, dry, rope, match, such, as, is, used, for, discharging, cannon, next, follows, that, of, ignited, charcoal, or, cinders, and, even, bricks, and, the, like, but, the, most, violent, is, that, of, ignited, metals, as, iron, copper, and, the, like, further, inquiry, however, must, be, made, into, this, also, some, ignited, bodies, are, found, to, be, much, warmer, than, some, flames, for, instance, red, hot, iron, is, much, warmer, and, burns, more, than, the, flame, of, spirits, of, wine, some, bodies, even, not, ignited, but, only, heated, by, the, fire, as, boiling, water, and, the, air, confined, in, reverberatories, surpass, in, heat, many, flames, and, ignited, substances, motion, increases, heat, [96], as, is, shown, in, the, bellows, and, the, blowpipe, for, the, harder, metals, are, not, dissolved, or, melted, by, steady, quiet, fire, without, the, aid, of, the, blowpipe, let, an, experiment, be, made, with, burning-glasses, in, which, respect, have, observed, that, if, a, glass, be, placed, at, the, distance, of, ten, inches, for, instance, from, the, combustible, object, it, does, not, kindle, or, burn, it, so, readily, as, if, the, glass, be, placed, at, the, distance, of, five, inches, (for, instance), and, be, then, gradually, and, slowly, withdrawn, to, the, distance, of, ten, inches, the, cone, and, focus, of, the, rays, however, are, the, same, but, the, mere, motion, increases, the, effect, of, the, heat, conflagrations, which, take, place, with, a, high, wind, are, thought, to, make, greater, way, against, than, with, the, wind, because, when, the, wind, slackens, the, flame, recoils, more, rapidly, than, it, advances, when, the, wind, is, favorable, flame, does, not, burst, out, or, arise, unless, it, have, some, hollow, space, to, move, and, exert, itself, in, except, in, the, exploding, flame, of, gunpowder, and, the, like, where, the, compression, and, confinement, of, the, flame, increase, its, fury, the, anvil, becomes, so, hot, by, the, hammer, that, if, it, were, a, thin, plate, it, might, probably, grow, red, like, ignited, iron, by, repeated, strokes, let, the, experiment, be, tried, but, in, ignited, bodies, that, are, porous, so, as, to, leave, room, for, the, fire, to, move, itself, if, its, motion, be, prevented, by, strong, compression, the, fire, is, immediately, extinguished, thus, it, is, with, tinder, or, the, burning, snuff, of, a, candle, or, lamp, or, even, hot, charcoal, or, cinders, for, when, they, are, squeezed, by, snuffers, or, the, foot, and, the, like, the, effect, of, the, fire, instantly, ceases, the, approach, toward, a, hot, body, increases, heat, in, proportion, to, the, approximation, a, similar, effect, to, that, of, light, for, the, nearer, any, object, is, placed, toward, the, light, the, more, visible, it, becomes, the[97], union, of, different, heats, increases, heat, unless, the, substances, be, mixed, for, a, large, and, small, fire, in, the, same, spot, tend, mutually, to, increase, each, other’s, heat, but, lukewarm, water, poured, into, boiling, water, cools, it, the, continued, neighborhood, of, a, warm, body, increases, heat, for, the, heat, which, perpetually, passes, and, emanates, from, it, being, mixed, with, that, which, preceded, it, multiplies, the, whole, fire, for, instance, does, not, warm, a, room, in, half, an, hour, as, much, as, the, same, fire, would, in, an, hour, this, does, not, apply, to, light, for, a, lamp, or, candle, placed, in, a, spot, gives, no, more, light, by, remaining, there, than, it, did, at, first, the, irritation, of, surrounding, cold, increases, heat, as, may, be, seen, in, fires, during, a, sharp, frost, we, think, that, this, is, owing, not, merely, to, the, confinement, and, compression, of, the, heat, (which, forms, a, sort, of, union), but, also, by, the, exasperation, of, it, as, when, the, air, or, a, stick, are, violently, compressed, or, bent, they, recoil, not, only, to, the, point, they, first, occupied, but, still, further, back, let, an, accurate, experiment, therefore, be, made, with, a, stick, or, something, of, the, kind, put, into, the, flame, in, order, to, see, whether, it, be, not, sooner, burned, at, the, sides, than, in, the, middle, of, it, [98], there, are, many, degrees, in, the, susceptibility, of, heat, and, first, it, must, be, observed, how, much, a, low, gentle, heat, changes, and, partially, warms, even, the, bodies, least, susceptible, of, it, for, even, the, heat, of, the, hand, imparts, a, little, warmth, to, a, ball, of, lead, or, other, metal, held, a, short, time, in, it, so, easily, is, heat, transmitted, and, excited, without, any, apparent, change, in, the, body, of, all, bodies, that, we, are, acquainted, with, air, admits, and, loses, heat, the, most, readily, which, is, admirably, seen, in, weather-glasses, whose, construction, is, as, follows, take, a, glass, with, a, hollow, belly, and, a, thin, and, long, neck, turn, it, upside, down, and, place, it, with, its, mouth, downward, into, another, glass, vessel, containing, water, the, end, of, the, tube, touching, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, and, the, tube, itself, leaning, a, little, on, the, edge, so, as, to, be, fixed, upright, in, order, to, do, this, more, readily, let, a, little, wax, be, applied, to, the, edge, not, however, so, as, to, block, up, the, orifice, lest, by, preventing, the, air, from, escaping, the, motion, which, we, shall, presently, speak, of, and, which, is, very, gentle, and, delicate, should, be, impeded, before, the, first, glass, be, inserted, in, the, other, its, upper, part, (the, belly), should, be, warmed, at, the, fire, then, upon, placing, it, as, we, have, described, the, air, (which, was, dilated, by, the, heat), after, a, sufficient, time, has, been, allowed, for, it, to, lose, the, additional, temperature, will, restore, and, contract, itself, to, the, same, dimensions, as, that, of, the, external, or, common, atmosphere, at, the, moment, of, immersion, and, the, water, will, be, attracted, upward, in, the, tube, to, a, proportionate, extent, long, narrow, slip, of, paper, should, be, attached, to, the, tube, divided, into, as, many, degrees, as, you, please, you, will, then, perceive, as, the, weather, grows, warmer, or, colder, that, the, air, contracts, itself, into, a, narrower, space, in, cold, weather, and, dilates, in, the, warm, which, will, be, exhibited, by, the, rising, of, the, water, as, the, air, contracts, itself, and, its, depression, as, the, air, dilates, the, sensibility, of, the, air, with, regard, to, heat, or, cold, is, so, delicate, and, exquisite, that, it, far, exceeds, the, human, touch, so, that, a, ray, of, sunshine, the, heat, of, the, breath, and, much, more, that, of, the, hand, placed, on, the, top, of, the, tube, immediately, causes, an, evident, depression, of, the, water, we, think, however, that, the, spirit, of, animals, possesses, a, much, more, delicate, susceptibility, of, heat, and, cold, only, that, it, is, impeded, and, blunted, by, the, grossness, of, their, bodies, after, air, we, consider, those, bodies, to, be, most, sensible, of, heat, which, have, been, recently, changed, and, contracted, by, cold, as, snow, and, ice, for, they, begin, to, be, dissolved, and, melt, with, the, first, mild, weather, next, perhaps, follows, quicksilver, then, greasy, substances, as, oil, butter, and, the, like, then, wood, then, water, lastly, stones, and, metals, which, do, not, easily, grow, hot, particularly, toward, their, centre, [99], when, heated, however, they, retain, their, temperature, for, a, very, long, time, so, that, a, brick, or, stone, or, hot, iron, plunged, in, a, basin, of, cold, water, and, kept, there, for, a, quarter, of, an, hour, or, thereabout, retains, such, a, heat, as, not, to, admit, of, being, touched, the, less, massive, the, body, is, the, more, readily, it, grows, warm, at, the, approach, of, a, heated, body, which, shows, that, heat, with, us, is, somewhat, averse, to, a, tangible, mass, [100], heat, with, regard, to, the, human, senses, and, touch, is, various, and, relative, so, that, lukewarm, water, appears, hot, if, the, hand, be, cold, and, cold, if, the, hand, be, hot, any, one, may, readily, see, how, poor, we, are, in, history, since, in, the, above, tables, besides, occasionally, inserting, traditions, and, report, instead, of, approved, history, and, authentic, instances, (always, however, adding, some, note, if, their, credit, or, authority, be, doubtful), we, are, often, forced, to, subjoin, “let, the, experiment, be, tried--let, further, inquiry, be, made, ”, we, are, wont, to, term, the, office, and, use, of, these, three, tables, the, presenting, a, review, of, instances, to, the, understanding, and, when, this, has, been, done, induction, itself, is, to, be, brought, into, action, for, on, an, individual, review, of, all, the, instances, a, nature, is, to, be, found, such, as, always, to, be, present, and, absent, with, the, given, nature, to, increase, and, decrease, with, it, and, as, we, have, said, to, form, a, more, common, limit, of, the, nature, if, the, mind, attempt, this, affirmatively, from, the, first, (which, it, always, will, when, left, to, itself), there, will, spring, up, phantoms, mere, theories, and, ill-defined, notions, with, axioms, requiring, daily, correction, these, will, doubtless, be, better, or, worse, according, to, the, power, and, strength, of, the, understanding, which, creates, them, but, it, is, only, for, god, (the, bestower, and, creator, of, forms), and, perhaps, for, angels, and, intelligences, at, once, to, recognize, forms, affirmatively, at, the, first, glance, of, contemplation, man, at, lest, is, unable, to, do, so, and, is, only, allowed, to, proceed, first, by, negatives, and, then, to, conclude, with, affirmatives, after, every, species, of, exclusion, we, must, therefore, effect, a, complete, solution, and, separation, of, nature, not, by, fire, but, by, the, mind, that, divine, fire, the, first, work, of, legitimate, induction, in, the, discovery, of, forms, is, rejection, or, the, exclusive, instances, of, individual, natures, which, are, not, found, in, some, one, instance, where, the, given, nature, is, present, or, are, found, in, any, one, instance, where, it, is, absent, or, are, found, to, increase, in, any, one, instance, where, the, given, nature, decreases, or, the, reverse, after, an, exclusion, correctly, effected, an, affirmative, form, will, remain, as, the, residuum, solid, true, and, well, defined, while, all, volatile, opinions, go, off, in, smoke, this, is, readily, said, but, we, must, arrive, at, it, by, a, circuitous, route, we, shall, perhaps, however, omit, nothing, that, can, facilitate, our, progress, the, first, and, almost, perpetual, precaution, and, warning, which, we, consider, necessary, is, this, that, none, should, suppose, from, the, great, part, assigned, by, us, to, forms, that, we, mean, such, forms, as, the, meditations, and, thoughts, of, men, have, hitherto, been, accustomed, to, in, the, first, place, we, do, not, at, present, mean, the, concrete, forms, which, (as, we, have, observed), are, in, the, common, course, of, things, compounded, of, simple, natures, as, those, of, a, lion, an, eagle, a, rose, gold, or, the, like, the, moment, for, discussing, these, will, arrive, when, we, come, to, treat, of, the, latent, process, and, latent, conformation, and, the, discovery, of, them, as, they, exist, in, what, are, called, substances, or, concrete, natures, nor, again, would, we, be, thought, to, mean, (even, when, treating, of, simple, natures), any, abstract, forms, or, ideas, either, undefined, or, badly, defined, in, matter, for, when, we, speak, of, forms, we, mean, nothing, else, than, those, laws, and, regulations, of, simple, action, which, arrange, and, constitute, any, simple, nature, such, as, heat, light, weight, in, every, species, of, matter, and, in, a, susceptible, subject, the, form, of, heat, or, form, of, light, therefore, means, no, more, than, the, law, of, heat, or, the, law, of, light, nor, do, we, ever, abstract, or, withdraw, ourselves, from, things, and, the, operative, branch, of, philosophy, when, therefore, we, say, (for, instance), in, our, investigation, of, the, form, of, heat, reject, rarity, or, rarity, is, not, of, the, form, of, heat, it, is, the, same, as, if, we, were, to, say, man, can, superinduce, heat, on, a, dense, body, or, the, reverse, man, can, abstract, or, ward, off, heat, from, a, rare, body, but, if, our, forms, appear, to, any, one, to, be, somewhat, abstracted, from, their, mingling, and, uniting, heterogeneous, objects, (the, heat, for, instance, of, the, heavenly, bodies, appears, to, be, very, different, from, that, of, fire, the, fixed, red, of, the, rose, and, the, like, from, that, which, is, apparent, in, the, rainbow, or, the, radiation, of, opal, or, the, diamond, [101], death, by, drowning, from, that, by, burning, the, sword, apoplexy, or, consumption, and, yet, they, all, agree, in, the, common, natures, of, heat, redness, and, death), let, him, be, assured, that, his, understanding, is, inthralled, by, habit, by, general, appearances, and, hypotheses, for, it, is, most, certain, that, however, heterogeneous, and, distinct, they, agree, in, the, form, or, law, which, regulates, heat, redness, or, death, and, that, human, power, cannot, be, emancipated, and, freed, from, the, common, course, of, nature, and, expanded, and, exalted, to, new, efficients, and, new, modes, of, operation, except, by, the, revelation, and, invention, of, forms, of, this, nature, but, after, this[102], union, of, nature, which, is, the, principal, point, we, will, afterward, in, its, proper, place, treat, of, the, divisions, and, ramifications, of, nature, whether, ordinary, or, internal, and, more, real, we, must, now, offer, an, example, of, the, exclusion, or, rejection, of, natures, found, by, the, tables, of, review, not, to, be, of, the, form, of, heat, first, premising, that, not, only, each, table, is, sufficient, for, the, rejection, of, any, nature, but, even, each, single, instance, contained, in, them, for, it, is, clear, from, what, has, been, said, that, every, contradictory, instance, destroys, a, hypothesis, as, to, the, form, still, however, for, the, sake, of, clearness, and, in, order, to, show, more, plainly, the, use, of, the, tables, we, redouble, or, repeat, the, exclusive, _an, example, of, the, exclusive, table, or, of, the, rejection, of, natures, from, the, form, of, heat_, on, account, of, the, sun’s, rays, reject, elementary, (or, terrestrial), nature, on, account, of, common, fire, and, particularly, subterranean, fires, (which, are, the, most, remote, and, secluded, from, the, rays, of, the, heavenly, bodies), reject, celestial, nature, on, account, of, the, heat, acquired, by, every, description, of, substances, (as, minerals, vegetables, the, external, parts, of, animals, water, oil, air, etc, ), by, mere, approximation, to, the, fire, or, any, warm, body, reject, all, variety, and, delicate, texture, of, bodies, on, account, of, iron, and, ignited, metals, which, warm, other, bodies, and, yet, neither, lose, their, weight, nor, substance, reject, the, imparting, or, mixing, of, the, substance, of, the, heating, body, on, account, of, boiling, water, and, air, and, also, those, metals, and, other, solid, bodies, which, are, heated, but, not, to, ignition, or, red, heat, reject, flame, or, light, on, account, of, the, rays, of, the, moon, and, other, heavenly, bodies, (except, the, sun), again, reject, flame, or, light, on, account, of, the, comparison, between, red-hot, iron, and, the, flame, of, spirits, of, wine, (for, the, iron, is, more, hot, and, less, bright, while, the, flame, of, spirits, of, wine, is, more, bright, and, less, hot), again, reject, flame, and, light, on, account, of, gold, and, other, ignited, metals, which, are, of, the, greatest, specific, density, reject, rarity, on, account, of, air, which, is, generally, found, to, be, cold, and, yet, continues, rare, reject, rarity, on, account, of, ignited, iron, [103], which, does, not, swell, in, bulk, but, retains, the, same, apparent, dimension, reject, the, absolute, expansive, motion, of, the, whole, on, account, of, the, expansion, of, the, air, in, thermometers, and, the, like, which, is, absolutely, moved, and, expanded, to, the, eye, and, yet, acquires, no, manifest, increase, of, heat, again, reject, absolute, or, expansive, motion, of, the, whole, on, account, of, the, ready, application, of, heat, to, all, substances, without, any, destruction, or, remarkable, alteration, of, them, reject, destructive, nature, or, the, violent, communication, of, any, new, nature, on, account, of, the, agreement, and, conformity, of, the, effects, produced, by, cold, and, heat, reject, both, expansive, and, contracting, motion, as, regards, the, whole, on, account, of, the, heat, excited, by, friction, reject, principal, nature, by, which, we, mean, that, which, exists, positively, and, is, not, caused, by, a, preceding, nature, there, are, other, natures, to, be, rejected, but, we, are, merely, offering, examples, and, not, perfect, tables, none, of, the, above, natures, are, of, the, form, of, heat, and, man, is, freed, from, them, all, in, his, operation, upon, heat, in, the, exclusive, table, are, laid, the, foundations, of, true, induction, which, is, not, however, completed, until, the, affirmative, be, attained, nor, is, the, exclusive, table, perfect, nor, can, it, be, so, at, first, for, it, is, clearly, a, rejection, of, simple, natures, but, if, we, have, not, as, yet, good, and, just, notions, of, simple, natures, how, can, the, exclusive, table, be, made, correct, some, of, the, above, as, the, notion, of, elementary, and, celestial, nature, and, rarity, are, vague, and, ill, defined, we, therefore, who, are, neither, ignorant, nor, forgetful, of, the, great, work, which, we, attempt, in, rendering, the, human, understanding, adequate, to, things, and, nature, by, no, means, rest, satisfied, with, what, we, have, hitherto, enforced, but, push, the, matter, further, and, contrive, and, prepare, more, powerful, aid, for, the, use, of, the, understanding, which, we, will, next, subjoin, and, indeed, in, the, interpretation, of, nature, the, mind, is, to, be, so, prepared, and, formed, as, to, rest, itself, on, proper, degrees, of, certainty, and, yet, to, remember, (especially, at, first), that, what, is, present, depends, much, upon, what, remains, behind, since, however, truth, emerges, more, readily, from, error, than, confusion, we, consider, it, useful, to, leave, the, understanding, at, liberty, to, exert, itself, and, attempt, the, interpretation, of, nature, in, the, affirmative, after, having, constructed, and, weighed, the, three, tables, of, preparation, such, as, we, have, laid, them, down, both, from, the, instances, there, collected, and, others, occurring, elsewhere, which, attempt, we, are, wont, to, call, the, liberty, of, the, understanding, or, the, commencement, of, interpretation, or, the, first, vintage, _the, first, vintage, of, the, form, of, heat_, it, must, be, observed, that, the, form, of, anything, is, inherent, (as, appears, clearly, from, our, premises), in, each, individual, instance, in, which, the, thing, itself, is, inherent, or, it, would, not, be, a, form, no, contradictory, instance, therefore, can, be, alleged, the, form, however, is, found, to, be, much, more, conspicuous, and, evident, in, some, instances, than, in, others, in, those, (for, example), where, its, nature, is, less, restrained, and, embarrassed, and, reduced, to, rule, by, other, natures, such, instances, we, are, wont, to, term, coruscations, or, conspicuous, instances, we, must, proceed, then, to, the, first, vintage, of, the, form, of, heat, from, the, instances, taken, collectively, as, well, as, singly, the, nature, whose, limit, is, heat, appears, to, be, motion, this, is, chiefly, exhibited, in, flame, which, is, in, constant, motion, and, in, warm, or, boiling, liquids, which, are, likewise, in, constant, motion, it, is, also, shown, in, the, excitement, or, increase, of, heat, by, motion, as, by, bellows, and, draughts, for, which, see, inst, 29, tab, 3, and, by, other, species, of, motion, as, in, inst, 28, and, 31, tab, 3, it, is, also, shown, by, the, extinction, of, fire, and, heat, upon, any, strong, pressure, which, restrains, and, puts, a, stop, to, motion, for, which, see, inst, 30, and, 32, tab, 3, it, is, further, shown, by, this, circumstance, namely, that, every, substance, is, destroyed, or, at, least, materially, changed, by, strong, and, powerful, fire, and, heat, whence, it, is, clear, that, tumult, and, confusion, are, occasioned, by, heat, together, with, a, violent, motion, in, the, internal, parts, of, bodies, and, this, gradually, tends, to, their, dissolution, what, we, have, said, with, regard, to, motion, must, be, thus, understood, when, taken, as, the, genus, of, heat, it, must, not, be, thought, that, heat, generates, motion, or, motion, heat, (though, in, some, respects, this, be, true), but, that, the, very, essence, of, heat, or, the, substantial, self[104], of, heat, is, motion, and, nothing, else, limited, however, by, certain, differences, which, we, will, presently, add, after, giving, some, cautions, for, avoiding, ambiguity, sensible, heat, is, relative, and, regards, man, not, universe, and, is, rightly, held, to, be, merely, the, effect, of, heat, on, animal, spirit, it, is, even, variable, in, itself, since, the, same, body, (in, different, states, of, sensation), excites, the, feeling, of, heat, and, of, cold, this, is, shown, by, inst, 41, tab, 3, nor, should, we, confound, the, communication, of, heat, or, its, transitive, nature, by, which, a, body, grows, warm, at, the, approach, of, a, heated, body, with, the, form, of, heat, for, heat, is, one, thing, and, heating, another, heat, can, be, excited, by, friction, without, any, previous, heating, body, and, therefore, heating, is, excluded, from, the, form, of, heat, even, when, heat, is, excited, by, the, approach, of, a, hot, body, this, depends, not, on, the, form, of, heat, but, on, another, more, profound, and, common, nature, namely, that, of, assimilation, and, multiplication, about, which, a, separate, inquiry, must, be, made, the, notion, of, fire, is, vulgar, and, of, no, assistance, it, is, merely, compounded, of, the, conjunction, of, heat, and, light, in, any, body, as, in, ordinary, flame, and, red-hot, substances, laying, aside, all, ambiguity, therefore, we, must, lastly, consider, the, true, differences, which, limit, motion, and, render, it, the, form, of, heat, the, first, difference, is, that, heat, is, an, expansive, motion, by, which, the, body, strives, to, dilate, itself, and, to, occupy, a, greater, space, than, before, this, difference, is, principally, seen, in, flame, where, the, smoke, or, thick, vapor, is, clearly, dilated, and, bursts, into, flame, it, is, also, shown, in, all, boiling, liquids, which, swell, rise, and, boil, up, to, the, sight, and, the, process, of, expansion, is, urged, forward, till, they, are, converted, into, a, much, more, extended, and, dilated, body, than, the, liquid, itself, such, as, steam, smoke, or, air, it, is, also, shown, in, wood, and, combustibles, where, exudation, sometimes, takes, place, and, evaporation, always, it, is, also, shown, in, the, melting, of, metals, which, being, very, compact, do, not, easily, swell, and, dilate, but, yet, their, spirit, when, dilated, and, desirous, of, further, expansion, forces, and, urges, its, thicker, parts, into, dissolution, and, if, the, heat, be, pushed, still, further, reduces, a, considerable, part, of, them, into, a, volatile, state, it, is, also, shown, in, iron, or, stones, which, though, not, melted, or, dissolved, are, however, softened, the, same, circumstance, takes, place, in, sticks, of, wood, which, become, flexible, when, a, little, heated, in, warm, ashes, it, is, most, readily, observed, in, air, which, instantly, and, manifestly, expands, with, a, small, degree, of, heat, as, in, inst, 38, tab, 3, it, is, also, shown, in, the, contrary, nature, of, cold, for, cold, contracts, and, narrows, every, substance, [105], so, that, in, intense, frosts, nails, fall, out, of, the, wall, and, brass, cracks, and, heated, glass, exposed, suddenly, to, the, cold, cracks, and, breaks, so, the, air, by, a, slight, degree, of, cold, contracts, itself, as, in, inst, 38, tab, 3, more, will, be, said, of, this, in, the, inquiry, into, cold, nor, is, it, to, be, wondered, at, if, cold, and, heat, exhibit, many, common, effects, (for, which, see, inst, 32, tab, 2), since, two, differences, of, which, we, shall, presently, speak, belong, to, each, nature, although, in, the, present, difference, the, effects, be, diametrically, opposed, to, each, other, for, heat, occasions, an, expansive, and, dilating, motion, but, cold, a, contracting, and, condensing, motion, the, second, difference, is, a, modification, of, the, preceding, namely, that, heat, is, an, expansive, motion, tending, toward, the, exterior, but, at, the, same, time, bearing, the, body, upward, for, there, is, no, doubt, that, there, be, many, compound, motions, as, an, arrow, or, dart, for, instance, has, both, a, rotatory, and, progressive, motion, in, the, same, way, the, motion, of, heat, is, both, expansive, and, tending, upward, this, difference, is, shown, by, putting, the, tongs, or, poker, into, the, fire, if, placed, perpendicularly, with, the, hand, above, they, soon, burn, it, but, much, less, speedily, if, the, hand, hold, them, sloping, or, from, below, it, is, also, conspicuous, in, distillations, _per, descensum_, which, men, are, wont, to, employ, with, delicate, flowers, whose, scent, easily, evaporates, their, industry, has, devised, placing, the, fire, above, instead, of, below, that, it, may, scorch, less, for, not, only, flame, but, all, heat, has, an, upward, tendency, let, an, experiment, be, made, on, the, contrary, nature, of, cold, whether, its, contraction, be, downward, as, the, expansion, of, heat, is, upward, take, therefore, two, iron, rods, or, two, glass, tubes, alike, in, other, respects, and, warm, them, a, little, and, place, a, sponge, dipped, in, cold, water, or, some, snow, below, the, one, and, above, the, other, we, are, of, opinion, that, the, extremities, will, grow, cold, in, that, rod, first, where, it, is, placed, beneath, as, the, contrary, takes, place, with, regard, to, heat, the, third, difference, is, this, that, heat, is, not, a, uniform, expansive, motion, of, the, whole, but, of, the, small, particles, of, the, body, and, this, motion, being, at, the, same, time, restrained, repulsed, and, reflected, becomes, alternating, perpetually, hurrying, striving, struggling, and, irritated, by, the, repercussion, which, is, the, source, of, the, violence, of, flame, and, heat, but, this, difference, is, chiefly, shown, in, flame, and, boiling, liquids, which, always, hurry, swell, and, subside, again, in, detached, parts, it, is, also, shown, in, bodies, of, such, hard, texture, as, not, to, swell, or, dilate, in, bulk, such, as, red-hot, iron, in, which, the, heat, is, most, violent, it, is, also, shown, by, the, fires, burning, most, briskly, in, the, coldest, weather, it, is, also, shown, by, this, that, when, the, air, is, dilated, in, the, thermometer, uniformly, and, equably, without, any, impediment, or, repulsion, the, heat, is, not, perceptible, in, confined, draughts, also, although, they, break, out, very, violently, no, remarkable, heat, is, perceived, because, the, motion, affects, the, whole, without, any, alternating, motion, in, the, particles, for, which, reason, try, whether, flame, do, not, burn, more, at, the, sides, than, in, its, centre, it, is, also, shown, in, this, that, all, burning, proceeds, by, the, minute, pores, of, bodies--undermining, penetrating, piercing, and, pricking, them, as, if, with, an, infinite, number, of, needle-points, hence, all, strong, acids, (if, adapted, to, the, body, on, which, they, act), exhibit, the, effects, of, fire, from, their, corroding, and, pungent, nature, the, difference, of, which, we, now, speak, is, common, also, to, the, nature, of, cold, in, which, the, contracting, motion, is, restrained, by, the, resistance, of, expansion, as, in, heat, the, expansive, motion, is, restrained, by, the, resistance, of, contraction, whether, therefore, the, particles, of, matter, penetrate, inward, or, outward, the, reasoning, is, the, same, though, the, power, be, very, different, because, we, have, nothing, on, earth, which, is, intensely, cold, the, fourth, difference, is, a, modification, of, the, preceding, namely, that, this, stimulating, or, penetrating, motion, should, be, rapid, and, never, sluggish, and, should, take, place, not, in, the, very, minutest, particles, but, rather, in, those, of, some, tolerable, dimensions, it, is, shown, by, comparing, the, effects, of, fire, with, those, of, time, time, dries, consumes, undermines, and, reduces, to, ashes, as, well, as, fire, and, perhaps, to, a, much, finer, degree, but, as, its, motion, is, very, slow, and, attacks, very, minute, particles, no, heat, is, perceived, it, is, also, shown, in, a, comparison, of, the, dissolution, of, iron, and, gold, for, gold, is, dissolved, without, the, excitement, of, any, heat, but, iron, with, a, vehement, excitement, of, it, although, most, in, the, same, time, because, in, the, former, the, penetration, of, the, separating, acid, is, mild, and, gently, insinuates, itself, and, the, particles, of, gold, yield, easily, but, the, penetration, of, iron, is, violent, and, attended, with, some, struggle, and, its, particles, are, more, obstinate, it, is, partially, shown, also, in, some, gangrenes, and, mortifications, of, flesh, which, do, not, excite, great, heat, or, pain, from, the, gentle, nature, of, the, putrefaction, let, this, suffice, for, a, first, vintage, or, the, commencement, of, the, interpretation, of, the, form, of, heat, by, the, liberty, of, the, understanding, from, this, first, vintage, the, form, or, true, definition, of, heat, (considered, relatively, to, the, universe, and, not, to, the, sense), is, briefly, thus--heat, is, an, expansive, motion, restrained, and, striving, to, exert, itself, in, the, smaller, particles, [106], the, expansion, is, modified, by, its, tendency, to, rise, though, expanding, toward, the, exterior, and, the, effort, is, modified, by, its, not, being, sluggish, but, active, and, somewhat, violent, with, regard, to, the, operative, definition, the, matter, is, the, same, if, you, are, able, to, excite, a, dilating, or, expansive, motion, in, any, natural, body, and, so, to, repress, that, motion, and, force, it, on, itself, as, not, to, allow, the, expansion, to, proceed, equally, but, only, to, be, partially, exerted, and, partially, repressed, you, will, beyond, all, doubt, produce, heat, without, any, consideration, as, to, whether, the, body, be, of, earth, (or, elementary, as, they, term, it), or, imbued, with, celestial, influence, luminous, or, opaque, rare, or, dense, locally, expanded, or, contained, within, the, bounds, of, its, first, dimensions, verging, to, dissolution, or, remaining, fixed, animal, vegetable, or, mineral, water, or, oil, or, air, or, any, other, substance, whatever, susceptible, of, such, motion, sensible, heat, is, the, same, but, considered, relatively, to, the, senses, let, us, now, proceed, to, further, helps, after, our, tables, of, first, review, our, rejection, or, exclusive, table, and, the, first, vintage, derived, from, them, we, must, advance, to, the, remaining, helps, of, the, understanding, with, regard, to, the, interpretation, of, nature, and, a, true, and, perfect, induction, in, offering, which, we, will, take, the, examples, of, cold, and, heat, where, tables, are, necessary, but, where, fewer, instances, are, required, we, will, go, through, a, variety, of, others, so, as, neither, to, confound, investigation, nor, to, narrow, our, doctrine, in, the, first, place, therefore, we, will, treat, of, prerogative, instances, [107], 2, of, the, supports, of, induction, 3, of, the, correction, of, induction, 4, of, varying, the, investigation, according, to, the, nature, of, the, subject, 5, of, the, prerogative, natures, with, respect, to, investigation, or, of, what, should, be, the, first, or, last, objects, of, our, research, 6, of, the, limits, of, investigation, or, a, synopsis, of, all, natures, that, exist, in, the, universe, 7, of, the, application, to, practical, purposes, or, of, what, relates, to, man, 8, of, the, preparations, for, investigation, 9, and, lastly, of, the, ascending, and, descending, scale, of, axioms, [108], among, the, prerogative, instances, we, will, first, mention, solitary, instances, solitary, instances, are, those, which, exhibit, the, required, nature, in, subjects, that, have, nothing, in, common, with, any, other, subject, than, the, nature, in, question, or, which, do, not, exhibit, the, required, nature, in, subjects, resembling, others, in, every, respect, except, that, of, the, nature, in, question, for, these, instances, manifestly, remove, prolixity, and, accelerate, and, confirm, exclusion, so, that, a, few, of, them, are, of, as, much, avail, as, many, for, instance, let, the, inquiry, be, the, nature, of, color, prisms, crystalline, gems, which, yield, colors, not, only, internally, but, on, the, wall, dews, etc, are, solitary, instances, for, they, have, nothing, in, common, with, the, fixed, colors, in, flowers, and, colored, gems, metals, woods, etc, except, the, color, itself, hence, we, easily, deduce, that, color, is, nothing, but, a, modification, of, the, image, of, the, incident, and, absorbed, light, occasioned, in, the, former, case, by, the, different, degrees, of, incidence, in, the, latter, by, the, various, textures, and, forms, of, bodies, [109], these, are, solitary, instances, as, regards, similitude, again, in, the, same, inquiry, the, distinct, veins, of, white, and, black, in, marble, and, the, variegated, colors, of, flowers, of, the, same, species, are, solitary, instances, for, the, black, and, white, of, marble, and, the, spots, of, white, and, purple, in, the, flowers, of, the, stock, agree, in, every, respect, but, that, of, color, thence, we, easily, deduce, that, color, has, not, much, to, do, with, the, intrinsic, natures, of, any, body, but, depends, only, on, the, coarser, and, as, it, were, mechanical, arrangement, of, the, parts, these, are, solitary, instances, as, regards, difference, we, call, them, both, solitary, or, wild, to, borrow, a, word, from, the, astronomers, in, the, second, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, consider, migrating, instances, in, these, the, required, nature, passes, toward, generation, having, no, previous, existence, or, toward, corruption, having, first, existed, in, each, of, these, divisions, therefore, the, instances, are, always, twofold, or, rather, it, is, one, instance, first, in, motion, or, on, its, passage, and, then, brought, to, the, opposite, conclusion, these, instances, not, only, hasten, and, confirm, exclusion, but, also, reduce, affirmation, or, the, form, itself, to, a, narrow, compass, for, the, form, must, be, something, conferred, by, this, migration, or, on, the, contrary, removed, and, destroyed, by, it, and, although, all, exclusion, advances, affirmation, yet, this, takes, place, more, directly, in, the, same, than, in, different, subjects, but, if, the, form, (as, it, is, quite, clear, from, what, has, been, advanced), exhibit, itself, in, one, subject, it, leads, to, all, the, more, simple, the, migration, is, the, more, valuable, is, the, instance, these, migrating, instances, are, moreover, very, useful, in, practice, for, since, they, manifest, the, form, coupled, with, that, which, causes, or, destroys, it, they, point, out, the, right, practice, in, some, subjects, and, thence, there, is, an, easy, transition, to, those, with, which, they, are, most, allied, there, is, however, a, degree, of, danger, which, demands, caution, namely, lest, they, should, refer, the, form, too, much, to, its, efficient, cause, and, imbue, or, at, least, tinge, the, understanding, with, a, false, notion, of, the, form, from, the, appearance, of, such, cause, which, is, never, more, than, a, vehicle, or, conveyance, of, the, form, this, may, easily, be, remedied, by, a, proper, application, of, exclusion, let, us, then, give, an, example, of, a, migrating, instance, let, whiteness, be, the, required, nature, an, instance, which, passes, toward, generation, is, glass, in, its, entire, and, in, its, powdered, state, or, water, in, its, natural, state, and, when, agitated, to, froth, for, glass, when, entire, and, water, in, its, natural, state, are, transparent, and, not, white, but, powdered, glass, and, the, froth, of, water, are, white, and, not, transparent, we, must, inquire, therefore, what, has, happened, to, the, glass, or, water, in, the, course, of, this, migration, for, it, is, manifest, that, the, form, of, whiteness, is, conveyed, and, introduced, by, the, bruising, of, the, glass, and, the, agitation, of, the, water, but, nothing, is, found, to, have, been, introduced, but, a, diminishing, of, the, parts, of, the, glass, and, water, and, the, insertion, of, air, yet, this, is, no, slight, progress, toward, discovering, the, form, of, whiteness, namely, that, two, bodies, in, themselves, more, or, less, transparent, (as, air, and, water, or, air, and, glass), when, brought, into, contact, in, minute, portions, exhibit, whiteness, from, the, unequal, refraction, of, the, rays, of, light, but, here, we, must, also, give, an, example, of, the, danger, and, caution, of, which, we, spoke, for, instance, it, will, readily, occur, to, an, understanding, perverted, by, efficients, that, air, is, always, necessary, for, producing, the, form, of, whiteness, or, that, whiteness, is, only, generated, by, transparent, bodies, which, suppositions, are, both, false, and, proved, to, be, so, by, many, exclusions, nay, it, will, rather, appear, (without, any, particular, regard, to, air, or, the, like), that, all, bodies, which, are, even, in, such, of, their, parts, as, affect, the, sight, exhibit, transparency, those, which, are, uneven, and, of, simple, texture, whiteness, those, which, are, uneven, and, of, compound, but, regular, texture, all, the, other, colors, except, black, but, those, which, are, uneven, and, of, a, compound, irregular, and, confused, texture, exhibit, blackness, an, example, has, been, given, therefore, of, an, instance, migrating, toward, generation, in, the, required, nature, of, whiteness, an, instance, migrating, toward, corruption, in, the, same, nature, is, that, of, dissolving, froth, or, snow, for, they, lose, their, whiteness, and, assume, the, transparency, of, water, in, its, pure, state, without, air, nor, should, we, by, any, means, omit, to, state, that, under, migrating, instances, we, must, comprehend, not, only, those, which, pass, toward, generation, and, destruction, but, also, those, which, pass, toward, increase, or, decrease, for, they, too, assist, in, the, discovery, of, the, form, as, is, clear, from, our, definition, of, a, form, and, the, table, of, degrees, hence, paper, which, is, white, when, dry, is, less, white, when, moistened, (from, the, exclusion, of, air, and, admission, of, water), and, tends, more, to, transparency, the, reason, is, the, same, as, in, the, above, instances, [110], in, the, third, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, conspicuous, instances, of, which, we, spoke, in, our, first, vintage, of, the, form, of, heat, and, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, coruscations, or, free, and, predominant, instances, they, are, such, as, show, the, required, nature, in, its, bare, substantial, shape, and, at, its, height, or, greatest, degree, of, power, emancipated, and, free, from, all, impediments, or, at, least, overcoming, suppressing, and, restraining, them, by, the, strength, of, its, qualities, for, since, every, body, is, susceptible, of, many, united, forms, of, natures, in, the, concrete, the, consequence, is, that, they, mutually, deaden, depress, break, and, confine, each, other, and, the, individual, forms, are, obscured, but, there, are, some, subjects, in, which, the, required, nature, exists, in, its, full, vigor, rather, than, in, others, either, from, the, absence, of, any, impediment, or, the, predominance, of, its, quality, such, instances, are, eminently, conspicuous, but, even, in, these, care, must, be, taken, and, the, hastiness, of, the, understanding, checked, for, whatever, makes, a, show, of, the, form, and, forces, it, forward, is, to, be, suspected, and, recourse, must, be, had, to, severe, and, diligent, exclusion, for, example, let, heat, be, the, required, nature, the, thermometer, is, a, conspicuous, instance, of, the, expansive, motion, which, (as, has, been, observed), constitutes, the, chief, part, of, the, form, of, heat, for, although, flame, clearly, exhibits, expansion, yet, from, its, being, extinguished, every, moment, it, does, not, exhibit, the, progress, of, expansion, boiling, water, again, from, its, rapid, conversion, into, vapor, does, not, so, well, exhibit, the, expansion, of, water, in, its, own, shape, while, red-hot, iron, and, the, like, are, so, far, from, showing, this, progress, that, on, the, contrary, the, expansion, itself, is, scarcely, evident, to, the, senses, on, account, of, its, spirit, being, repressed, and, weakened, by, the, compact, and, coarse, particles, which, subdue, and, restrain, it, but, the, thermometer, strikingly, exhibits, the, expansion, of, the, air, as, being, evident, and, progressive, durable, and, not, transitory, [111], take, another, example, let, the, required, nature, be, weight, quicksilver, is, a, conspicuous, instance, of, weight, for, it, is, far, heavier, than, any, other, substance, except, gold, which, is, not, much, heavier, and, it, is, a, better, instance, than, gold, for, the, purpose, of, indicating, the, form, of, weight, for, gold, is, solid, and, consistent, which, qualities, must, be, referred, to, density, but, quicksilver, is, liquid, and, teeming, with, spirit, yet, much, heavier, than, the, diamond, and, other, substances, considered, to, be, most, solid, whence, it, is, shown, that, the, form, of, gravity, or, weight, predominates, only, in, the, quantity, of, matter, and, not, in, the, close, fitting, of, it, [112], in, the, fourth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, clandestine, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, twilight, instances, they, are, as, it, were, opposed, to, the, conspicuous, instances, for, they, show, the, required, nature, in, its, lowest, state, of, efficacy, and, as, it, were, its, cradle, and, first, rudiments, making, an, effort, and, a, sort, of, first, attempt, but, concealed, and, subdued, by, a, contrary, nature, such, instances, are, however, of, great, importance, in, discovering, forms, for, as, the, conspicuous, tend, easily, to, differences, so, do, the, clandestine, best, lead, to, genera, that, is, to, those, common, natures, of, which, the, required, natures, are, only, the, limits, as, an, example, let, consistency, or, that, which, confines, itself, be, the, required, nature, the, opposite, of, which, is, a, liquid, or, flowing, state, the, clandestine, instances, are, such, as, exhibit, some, weak, and, low, degree, of, consistency, in, fluids, as, a, water, bubble, which, is, a, sort, of, consistent, and, bounded, pellicle, formed, out, of, the, substance, of, the, water, so, eaves’, droppings, if, there, be, enough, water, to, follow, them, draw, themselves, out, into, a, thin, thread, not, to, break, the, continuity, of, the, water, but, if, there, be, not, enough, to, follow, the, water, forms, itself, into, a, round, drop, which, is, the, best, form, to, prevent, a, breach, of, continuity, and, at, the, moment, the, thread, ceases, and, the, water, begins, to, fall, in, drops, the, thread, of, water, recoils, upward, to, avoid, such, a, breach, nay, in, metals, which, when, melted, are, liquid, but, more, tenacious, the, melted, drops, often, recoil, and, are, suspended, there, is, something, similar, in, the, instance, of, the, child’s, looking-glass, which, little, boys, will, sometimes, form, of, spittle, between, rushes, and, where, the, same, pellicle, of, water, is, observable, and, still, more, in, that, other, amusement, of, children, when, they, take, some, water, rendered, a, little, more, tenacious, by, soap, and, inflate, it, with, a, pipe, forming, the, water, into, a, sort, of, castle, of, bubbles, which, assumes, such, consistency, by, the, interposition, of, the, air, as, to, admit, of, being, thrown, some, little, distance, without, bursting, the, best, example, is, that, of, froth, and, snow, which, assume, such, consistency, as, almost, to, admit, of, being, cut, although, composed, of, air, and, water, both, liquids, all, these, circumstances, clearly, show, that, the, terms, liquid, and, consistent, are, merely, vulgar, notions, adapted, to, the, sense, and, that, in, reality, all, bodies, have, a, tendency, to, avoid, a, breach, of, continuity, faint, and, weak, in, bodies, composed, of, homogeneous, parts, (as, is, the, case, with, liquids), but, more, vivid, and, powerful, in, those, composed, of, heterogeneous, parts, because, the, approach, of, heterogeneous, matter, binds, bodies, together, while, the, insinuation, of, homogeneous, matter, loosens, and, relaxes, them, again, to, take, another, example, let, the, required, nature, be, attraction, or, the, cohesion, of, bodies, the, most, remarkable, conspicuous, instance, with, regard, to, its, form, is, the, magnet, the, contrary, nature, to, attraction, is, non-attraction, though, in, a, similar, substance, thus, iron, does, not, attract, iron, lead, lead, wood, wood, nor, water, water, but, the, clandestine, instance, is, that, of, the, magnet, armed, with, iron, or, rather, that, of, iron, in, the, magnet, so, armed, for, its, nature, is, such, that, the, magnet, when, armed, does, not, attract, iron, more, powerfully, at, any, given, distance, than, when, unarmed, but, if, the, iron, be, brought, in, contact, with, the, armed, magnet, the, latter, will, sustain, a, much, greater, weight, than, the, simple, magnet, from, the, resemblance, of, substance, in, the, two, portions, of, iron, a, quality, altogether, clandestine, and, hidden, in, the, iron, until, the, magnet, was, introduced, it, is, manifest, therefore, that, the, form, of, cohesion, is, something, which, is, vivid, and, robust, in, the, magnet, and, hidden, and, weak, in, the, iron, it, is, to, be, observed, also, that, small, wooden, arrows, without, an, iron, point, when, discharged, from, large, mortars, penetrate, further, into, wooden, substances, (such, as, the, ribs, of, ships, or, the, like), than, the, same, arrows, pointed, with, iron, [113], owing, to, the, similarity, of, substance, though, this, quality, was, previously, latent, in, the, wood, again, although, in, the, mass, air, does, not, appear, to, attract, air, nor, water, water, yet, when, one, bubble, is, brought, near, another, they, are, both, more, readily, dissolved, from, the, tendency, to, contact, of, the, water, with, the, water, and, the, air, with, the, air, [114], these, clandestine, instances, (which, are, as, has, been, observed, of, the, most, important, service), are, principally, to, be, observed, in, small, portions, of, bodies, for, the, larger, masses, observe, more, universal, and, general, forms, as, will, be, mentioned, in, its, proper, place, [115], in, the, fifth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, constitutive, instances, which, we, are, wont, also, to, call, collective, instances, they, constitute, a, species, or, lesser, form, as, it, were, of, the, required, nature, for, since, the, real, forms, (which, are, always, convertible, with, the, given, nature), lie, at, some, depth, and, are, not, easily, discovered, the, necessity, of, the, case, and, the, infirmity, of, the, human, understanding, require, that, the, particular, forms, which, collect, certain, groups, of, instances, (but, by, no, means, all), into, some, common, notion, should, not, be, neglected, but, most, diligently, observed, for, whatever, unites, nature, even, imperfectly, opens, the, way, to, the, discovery, of, the, form, the, instances, therefore, which, are, serviceable, in, this, respect, are, of, no, mean, power, but, endowed, with, some, degree, of, prerogative, here, nevertheless, great, care, must, be, taken, that, after, the, discovery, of, several, of, these, particular, forms, and, the, establishing, of, certain, partitions, or, divisions, of, the, required, nature, derived, from, them, the, human, understanding, do, not, at, once, rest, satisfied, without, preparing, for, the, investigation, of, the, great, or, leading, form, and, taking, it, for, granted, that, nature, is, compound, and, divided, from, its, very, root, despise, and, reject, any, further, union, as, a, point, of, superfluous, refinement, and, tending, to, mere, abstraction, for, instance, let, the, required, nature, be, memory, or, that, which, excites, and, assists, memory, the, constitutive, instances, are, order, or, distribution, which, manifestly, assists, memory, topics, or, commonplaces, in, artificial, memory, which, may, be, either, places, in, their, literal, sense, as, a, gate, a, corner, a, window, and, the, like, or, familiar, persons, and, marks, or, anything, else, (provided, it, be, arranged, in, a, determinate, order), as, animals, plants, and, words, letters, characters, historical, persons, and, the, like, of, which, however, some, are, more, convenient, than, others, all, these, commonplaces, materially, assist, memory, and, raise, it, far, above, its, natural, strength, verse, too, is, recollected, and, learned, more, easily, than, prose, from, this, group, of, three, instances--order, the, commonplaces, of, artificial, memory, and, verses--is, constituted, one, species, of, aid, for, the, memory, [116], which, may, be, well, termed, a, separation, from, infinity, for, when, a, man, strives, to, recollect, or, recall, anything, to, memory, without, a, preconceived, notion, or, perception, of, the, object, of, his, search, he, inquires, about, and, labors, and, turns, from, point, to, point, as, if, involved, in, infinity, but, if, he, have, any, preconceived, notion, this, infinity, is, separated, off, and, the, range, of, his, memory, is, brought, within, closer, limits, in, the, three, instances, given, above, the, preconceived, notion, is, clear, and, determined, in, the, first, it, must, be, something, that, agrees, with, order, in, the, second, an, image, which, has, some, relation, or, agreement, with, the, fixed, commonplaces, in, the, third, words, which, fall, into, a, verse, and, thus, infinity, is, divided, off, other, instances, will, offer, another, species, namely, that, whatever, brings, the, intellect, into, contact, with, something, that, strikes, the, sense, (the, principal, point, of, artificial, memory), assists, the, memory, others, again, offer, another, species, namely, whatever, excites, an, impression, by, any, powerful, passion, as, fear, shame, wonder, delight, assists, the, memory, other, instances, will, afford, another, species, thus, those, impressions, remain, most, fixed, in, the, memory, which, are, taken, from, the, mind, when, clear, and, least, occupied, by, preceding, or, succeeding, notions, such, as, the, things, we, learn, in, childhood, or, imagine, before, sleep, and, the, first, time, of, any, circumstance, happening, other, instances, afford, the, following, species, namely, that, a, multitude, of, circumstances, or, handles, assist, the, memory, such, as, writing, in, paragraphs, reading, aloud, or, recitation, lastly, other, instances, afford, still, another, species, thus, the, things, we, anticipate, and, which, rouse, our, attention, are, more, easily, remembered, than, transient, events, as, if, you, read, any, work, twenty, times, over, you, will, not, learn, it, by, heart, so, readily, as, if, you, were, to, read, it, but, ten, times, trying, each, time, to, repeat, it, and, when, your, memory, fails, you, looking, into, the, book, there, are, therefore, six, lesser, forms, as, it, were, of, things, which, assist, the, memory, namely--1, the, separation, of, infinity, 2, the, connection, of, the, mind, with, the, senses, 3, the, impression, in, strong, passion, 4, the, impression, on, the, mind, when, pure, 5, the, multitude, of, handles, 6, anticipation, again, for, example’s, sake, let, the, required, nature, be, taste, or, the, power, of, tasting, the, following, instances, are, constitutive, 1, those, who, do, not, smell, but, are, deprived, by, nature, of, that, sense, do, not, perceive, or, distinguish, rancid, or, putrid, food, by, their, taste, nor, garlic, from, roses, and, the, like, 2, again, those, whose, nostrils, are, obstructed, by, accident, (such, as, a, cold), do, not, distinguish, any, putrid, or, rancid, matter, from, anything, sprinkled, with, rose-water, 3, if, those, who, suffer, from, a, cold, blow, their, noses, violently, at, the, very, moment, in, which, they, have, anything, fetid, or, perfumed, in, their, mouth, or, on, their, palate, they, instantly, have, a, clear, perception, of, the, fetor, or, perfume, these, instances, afford, and, constitute, this, species, or, division, of, taste, namely, that, it, is, in, part, nothing, else, than, an, internal, smelling, passing, and, descending, through, the, upper, passages, of, the, nostrils, to, the, mouth, and, palate, but, on, the, other, hand, those, whose, power, of, smelling, is, deficient, or, obstructed, perceive, what, is, salt, sweet, pungent, acid, rough, and, bitter, and, the, like, as, well, as, any, one, else, so, that, the, taste, is, clearly, something, compounded, of, the, internal, smelling, and, an, exquisite, species, of, touch, which, we, will, not, here, discuss, again, as, another, example, let, the, required, nature, be, the, communication, of, quality, without, intermixture, of, substance, the, instance, of, light, will, afford, or, constitute, one, species, of, communication, heat, and, the, magnet, another, for, the, communication, of, light, is, momentary, and, immediately, arrested, upon, the, removal, of, the, original, light, but, heat, and, the, magnetic, force, when, once, transmitted, to, or, excited, in, another, body, remain, fixed, for, a, considerable, time, after, the, removal, of, the, source, in, fine, the, prerogative, of, constitutive, instances, is, considerable, for, they, materially, assist, the, definitions, (especially, in, detail), and, the, divisions, or, partitions, of, natures, concerning, which, plato, has, well, said, “he, who, can, properly, define, and, divide, is, to, be, considered, a, god, ”[117], in, the, sixth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, similar, or, proportionate, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, physical, parallels, or, resemblances, they, are, such, as, exhibit, the, resemblances, and, connection, of, things, not, in, minor, forms, (as, the, constitutive, do), but, at, once, in, the, concrete, they, are, therefore, as, it, were, the, first, and, lowest, steps, toward, the, union, of, nature, nor, do, they, immediately, establish, any, axiom, but, merely, indicate, and, observe, a, certain, relation, of, bodies, to, each, other, but, although, they, be, not, of, much, assistance, in, discovering, forms, yet, they, are, of, great, advantage, in, disclosing, the, frame, of, parts, of, the, universe, upon, whose, members, they, practice, a, species, of, anatomy, and, thence, occasionally, lead, us, gently, on, to, sublime, and, noble, axioms, especially, such, as, relate, to, the, construction, of, the, world, rather, than, to, simple, natures, and, forms, as, an, example, take, the, following, similar, instances, a, mirror, and, the, eye, the, formation, of, the, ear, and, places, which, return, an, echo, from, such, similarity, besides, observing, the, resemblance, (which, is, useful, for, many, purposes), it, is, easy, to, collect, and, form, this, axiom, that, the, organs, of, the, senses, and, bodies, which, produce, reflections, to, the, senses, are, of, a, similar, nature, again, the, understanding, once, informed, of, this, rises, easily, to, a, higher, and, nobler, axiom, namely, that, the, only, distinction, between, sensitive, and, inanimate, bodies, in, those, points, in, which, they, agree, and, sympathize, is, this, in, the, former, animal, spirit, is, added, to, the, arrangement, of, the, body, in, the, latter, it, is, wanting, so, that, there, might, be, as, many, senses, in, animals, as, there, are, points, of, agreement, with, inanimate, bodies, if, the, animated, body, were, perforated, so, as, to, allow, the, spirit, to, have, access, to, the, limb, properly, disposed, for, action, as, a, fit, organ, and, on, the, other, hand, there, are, without, doubt, as, many, motions, in, an, inanimate, as, there, are, senses, in, the, animated, body, though, the, animal, spirit, be, absent, there, must, however, be, many, more, motions, in, inanimate, bodies, than, senses, in, the, animated, from, the, small, number, of, organs, of, sense, very, plain, example, of, this, is, afforded, by, pains, for, as, animals, are, liable, to, many, kinds, and, various, descriptions, of, pains, (such, as, those, of, burning, of, intense, cold, of, pricking, squeezing, stretching, and, the, like), so, is, it, most, certain, that, the, same, circumstances, as, far, as, motion, is, concerned, happen, to, inanimate, bodies, such, as, wood, or, stone, when, burned, frozen, pricked, cut, bent, bruised, and, the, like, although, there, be, no, sensation, owing, to, the, absence, of, animal, spirit, again, wonderful, as, it, may, appear, the, roots, and, branches, of, trees, are, similar, instances, for, every, vegetable, swells, and, throws, out, its, constituent, parts, toward, the, circumference, both, upward, and, downward, and, there, is, no, difference, between, the, roots, and, branches, except, that, the, root, is, buried, in, the, earth, and, the, branches, are, exposed, to, the, air, and, sun, for, if, one, take, a, young, and, vigorous, shoot, and, bend, it, down, to, a, small, portion, of, loose, earth, although, it, be, not, fixed, to, the, ground, yet, will, it, immediately, produce, a, root, and, not, a, branch, and, _vice, versâ_, if, earth, be, placed, above, and, so, forced, down, with, a, stone, or, any, hard, substance, as, to, confine, the, plant, and, prevent, its, branching, upward, it, will, throw, out, branches, into, the, air, downward, the, gums, of, trees, and, most, rock, gems, are, similar, instances, for, both, of, them, are, exudations, and, filtered, juices, derived, in, the, former, instance, from, trees, in, the, latter, from, stones, the, brightness, and, clearness, of, both, arising, from, a, delicate, and, accurate, filtering, for, nearly, the, same, reason, the, hair, of, animals, is, less, beautiful, and, vivid, in, its, color, than, the, plumage, of, most, birds, because, the, juices, are, less, delicately, filtered, through, the, skin, than, through, the, quills, the, scrotum, of, males, and, matrix, of, females, are, also, similar, instances, so, that, the, noble, formation, which, constitutes, the, difference, of, the, sexes, appears, to, differ, only, as, to, the, one, being, internal, and, the, other, external, a, greater, degree, of, heat, causing, the, genitals, to, protrude, in, the, male, while, the, heat, of, the, female, being, too, weak, to, effect, this, they, are, retained, internally, the, fins, of, fishes, and, the, feet, of, quadrupeds, or, the, feet, and, wings, of, birds, are, similar, instances, to, which, aristotle, adds, the, four, folds, in, the, motion, of, serpents, [118], so, that, in, the, formation, of, the, universe, the, motion, of, animals, appears, to, be, chiefly, effected, by, four, joints, or, bendings, the, teeth, of, land, animals, and, the, beaks, of, birds, are, similar, instances, whence, it, is, clear, that, in, all, perfect, animals, there, is, a, determination, of, some, hard, substance, toward, the, mouth, again, the, resemblance, and, conformity, of, man, to, an, inverted, plant, is, not, absurd, for, the, head, is, the, root, of, the, nerves, and, animal, faculties, and, the, seminal, parts, are, the, lowest, not, including, the, extremities, of, the, legs, and, arms, but, in, the, plant, the, root, (which, resembles, the, head), is, regularly, placed, in, the, lowest, and, the, seeds, in, the, highest, part, [119], lastly, we, must, particularly, recommend, and, suggest, that, man’s, present, industry, in, the, investigation, and, compilation, of, natural, history, be, entirely, changed, and, directed, to, the, reverse, of, the, present, system, for, it, has, hitherto, been, active, and, curious, in, noting, the, variety, of, things, and, explaining, the, accurate, differences, of, animals, vegetables, and, minerals, most, of, which, are, the, mere, sport, of, nature, rather, than, of, any, real, utility, as, concerns, the, sciences, pursuits, of, this, nature, are, certainly, agreeable, and, sometimes, of, practical, advantage, but, contribute, little, or, nothing, to, the, thorough, investigation, of, nature, our, labor, must, therefore, be, directed, toward, inquiring, into, and, observing, resemblances, and, analogies, both, in, the, whole, and, its, parts, for, they, unite, nature, and, lay, the, foundation, of, the, sciences, here, however, a, severe, and, rigorous, caution, must, be, observed, that, we, only, consider, as, similar, and, proportionate, instances, those, which, (as, we, first, observed), point, out, physical, resemblances, that, is, real, and, substantial, resemblances, deeply, founded, in, nature, and, not, casual, and, superficial, much, less, superstitious, or, curious, such, as, those, which, are, constantly, put, forward, by, the, writers, on, natural, magic, (the, most, idle, of, men, and, who, are, scarcely, fit, to, be, named, in, connection, with, such, serious, matters, as, we, now, treat, of), who, with, much, vanity, and, folly, describe, and, sometimes, too, invent, unmeaning, resemblances, and, sympathies, but, leaving, such, to, themselves, similar, instances, are, not, to, be, neglected, in, the, greater, portions, of, the, world’s, conformation, such, as, africa, and, the, peruvian, continent, which, reaches, to, the, straits, of, magellan, both, of, which, possess, a, similar, isthmus, and, similar, capes, a, circumstance, not, to, be, attributed, to, mere, accident, again, the, new, and, old, world, are, both, of, them, broad, and, expanded, toward, the, north, and, narrow, and, pointed, toward, the, south, again, we, have, very, remarkable, similar, instances, in, the, intense, cold, toward, the, middle, regions, (as, it, is, termed), of, the, air, and, the, violent, fires, which, are, often, found, to, burst, from, subterraneous, spots, the, similarity, consisting, in, both, being, ends, and, extremes, the, extreme, of, the, nature, of, cold, for, instance, is, toward, the, boundary, of, heaven, and, that, of, the, nature, of, heat, toward, the, centre, of, the, earth, by, a, similar, species, of, opposition, or, rejection, of, the, contrary, nature, lastly, in, the, axioms, of, the, sciences, there, is, a, similarity, of, instances, worthy, of, observation, thus, the, rhetorical, trope, which, is, called, surprise, is, similar, to, that, of, music, termed, the, declining, of, a, cadence, again--the, mathematical, postulate, that, things, which, are, equal, to, the, same, are, equal, to, one, another, is, similar, to, the, form, of, the, syllogism, in, logic, which, unites, things, agreeing, in, the, middle, term, [120], lastly, a, certain, degree, of, sagacity, in, collecting, and, searching, for, physical, points, of, similarity, is, very, useful, in, many, respects, [121], in, the, seventh, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, singular, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, irregular, or, heteroclite, (to, borrow, a, term, from, the, grammarians), they, are, such, as, exhibit, bodies, in, the, concrete, of, an, apparently, extravagant, and, separate, nature, agreeing, but, little, with, other, things, of, the, same, species, for, while, the, similar, instances, resemble, each, other, those, we, now, speak, of, are, only, like, themselves, their, use, is, much, the, same, with, that, of, clandestine, instances, they, bring, out, and, unite, nature, and, discover, genera, or, common, natures, which, must, afterward, be, limited, by, real, differences, nor, should, we, desist, from, inquiry, until, the, properties, and, qualities, of, those, things, which, may, be, deemed, miracles, as, it, were, of, nature, be, reduced, to, and, comprehended, in, some, form, or, certain, law, so, that, all, irregularity, or, singularity, may, be, found, to, depend, on, some, common, form, and, the, miracle, only, consists, in, accurate, differences, degree, and, rare, coincidence, not, in, the, species, itself, man’s, meditation, proceeds, no, further, at, present, than, just, to, consider, things, of, this, kind, as, the, secrets, and, vast, efforts, of, nature, without, an, assignable, cause, and, as, it, were, exceptions, to, general, rules, as, examples, of, singular, instances, we, have, the, sun, and, moon, among, the, heavenly, bodies, the, magnet, among, minerals, quicksilver, among, metals, the, elephant, among, quadrupeds, the, venereal, sensation, among, the, different, kinds, of, touch, the, scent, of, sporting, dogs, among, those, of, smell, the, letter, too, is, considered, by, the, grammarians, as, sui, generis, from, its, easily, uniting, with, double, or, triple, consonants, which, no, other, letter, will, these, instances, are, of, great, value, because, they, excite, and, keep, alive, inquiry, and, correct, an, understanding, depraved, by, habit, and, the, common, course, of, things, in, the, eighth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, deviating, instances, such, as, the, errors, of, nature, or, strange, and, monstrous, objects, in, which, nature, deviates, and, turns, from, her, ordinary, course, for, the, errors, of, nature, differ, from, singular, instances, inasmuch, as, the, latter, are, the, miracles, of, species, the, former, of, individuals, their, use, is, much, the, same, for, they, rectify, the, understanding, in, opposition, to, habit, and, reveal, common, forms, for, with, regard, to, these, also, we, must, not, desist, from, inquiry, till, we, discern, the, cause, of, the, deviation, the, cause, does, not, however, in, such, cases, rise, to, a, regular, form, but, only, to, the, latent, process, toward, such, a, form, for, he, who, is, acquainted, with, the, paths, of, nature, will, more, readily, observe, her, deviations, and, _vice, versâ_, he, who, has, learned, her, deviations, will, be, able, more, accurately, to, describe, her, paths, they, differ, again, from, singular, instances, by, being, much, more, apt, for, practice, and, the, operative, branch, for, it, would, be, very, difficult, to, generate, new, species, but, less, so, to, vary, known, species, and, thus, produce, many, rare, and, unusual, results, [122], the, passage, from, the, miracles, of, nature, to, those, of, art, is, easy, for, if, nature, be, once, seized, in, her, variations, and, the, cause, be, manifest, it, will, be, easy, to, lead, her, by, art, to, such, deviation, as, she, was, at, first, led, to, by, chance, and, not, only, to, that, but, others, since, deviations, on, the, one, side, lead, and, open, the, way, to, others, in, every, direction, of, this, we, do, not, require, any, examples, since, they, are, so, abundant, for, a, compilation, or, particular, natural, history, must, be, made, of, all, monsters, and, prodigious, births, of, nature, of, everything, in, short, which, is, new, rare, and, unusual, in, nature, this, should, be, done, with, a, rigorous, selection, so, as, to, be, worthy, of, credit, those, are, most, to, be, suspected, which, depend, upon, superstition, as, the, prodigies, of, livy, and, those, perhaps, but, little, less, which, are, found, in, the, works, of, writers, on, natural, magic, or, even, alchemy, and, the, like, for, such, men, as, it, were, are, the, very, suitors, and, lovers, of, fables, but, our, instances, should, be, derived, from, some, grave, and, credible, history, and, faithful, narration, in, the, ninth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, bordering, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, term, participants, they, are, such, as, exhibit, those, species, of, bodies, which, appear, to, be, composed, of, two, species, or, to, be, the, rudiments, between, the, one, and, the, other, they, may, well, be, classed, with, the, singular, or, heteroclite, instances, for, in, the, whole, system, of, things, they, are, rare, and, extraordinary, yet, from, their, dignity, they, must, be, treated, of, and, classed, separately, for, they, point, out, admirably, the, order, and, constitution, of, things, and, suggest, the, causes, of, the, number, and, quality, of, the, more, common, species, in, the, universe, leading, the, understanding, from, that, which, is, to, that, which, is, possible, we, have, examples, of, them, in, moss, which, is, something, between, putrescence, and, a, plant, [123], in, some, comets, which, hold, a, place, between, stars, and, ignited, meteors, in, flying, fishes, between, fishes, and, birds, and, in, bats, between, birds, and, quadrupeds, [124], again, simia, quam, similis, turpissima, bestia, nobis, we, have, also, biformed, fœtus, mingled, species, and, the, like, in, the, tenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, instances, of, power, or, the, fasces, (to, borrow, a, term, from, the, insignia, of, empire), which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, the, wit, or, hands, of, man, these, are, such, works, as, are, most, noble, and, perfect, and, as, it, were, the, masterpieces, in, every, art, for, since, our, principal, object, is, to, make, nature, subservient, to, the, state, and, wants, of, man, it, becomes, us, well, to, note, and, enumerate, the, works, which, have, long, since, been, in, the, power, of, man, especially, those, which, are, most, polished, and, perfect, because, the, passage, from, these, to, new, and, hitherto, undiscovered, works, is, more, easy, and, feasible, for, if, any, one, after, an, attentive, contemplation, of, such, works, as, are, extant, be, willing, to, push, forward, in, his, design, with, alacrity, and, vigor, he, will, undoubtedly, either, advance, them, or, turn, them, to, something, within, their, immediate, reach, or, even, apply, and, transfer, them, to, some, more, noble, purpose, nor, is, this, all, for, as, the, understanding, is, elevated, and, raised, by, rare, and, unusual, works, of, nature, to, investigate, and, discover, the, forms, which, include, them, also, so, is, the, same, effect, frequently, produced, by, the, excellent, and, wonderful, works, of, art, and, even, to, a, greater, degree, because, the, mode, of, effecting, and, constructing, the, miracles, of, art, is, generally, plain, while, that, of, effecting, the, miracles, of, nature, is, more, obscure, great, care, however, must, be, taken, that, they, do, not, depress, the, understanding, and, fix, it, as, it, were, to, earth, for, there, is, some, danger, lest, the, understanding, should, be, astonished, and, chained, down, and, as, it, were, bewitched, by, such, works, of, art, as, appear, to, be, the, very, summit, and, pinnacle, of, human, industry, so, as, not, to, become, familiar, with, them, but, rather, to, suppose, that, nothing, of, the, kind, can, be, accomplished, unless, the, same, means, be, employed, with, perhaps, a, little, more, diligence, and, more, accurate, preparation, now, on, the, contrary, it, may, be, stated, as, a, fact, that, the, ways, and, means, hitherto, discovered, and, observed, of, effecting, any, matter, or, work, are, for, the, most, part, of, little, value, and, that, all, really, efficient, power, depends, and, is, really, to, be, deduced, from, the, sources, of, forms, none, of, which, have, yet, been, discovered, thus, (as, we, have, before, observed), had, any, one, meditated, on, ballistic, machines, and, battering, rams, as, they, were, used, by, the, ancients, whatever, application, he, might, have, exerted, and, though, he, might, have, consumed, a, whole, life, in, the, pursuit, yet, would, he, never, have, hit, upon, the, invention, of, flaming, engines, acting, by, means, of, gunpowder, nor, would, any, person, who, had, made, woollen, manufactories, and, cotton, the, subject, of, his, observation, and, reflection, have, ever, discovered, thereby, the, nature, of, the, silkworm, or, of, silk, hence, all, the, most, noble, discoveries, have, (if, you, observe), come, to, light, not, by, any, gradual, improvement, and, extension, of, the, arts, but, merely, by, chance, while, nothing, imitates, or, anticipates, chance, (which, is, wont, to, act, at, intervals, of, ages), but, the, invention, of, forms, there, is, no, necessity, for, adducing, any, particular, examples, of, these, instances, since, they, are, abundant, the, plan, to, be, pursued, is, this, all, the, mechanical, and, even, the, liberal, arts, (as, far, as, they, are, practical), should, be, visited, and, thoroughly, examined, and, thence, there, should, be, formed, a, compilation, or, particular, history, of, the, great, masterpieces, or, most, finished, works, in, each, as, well, as, of, the, mode, of, carrying, them, into, effect, nor, do, we, confine, the, diligence, to, be, used, in, such, a, compilation, to, the, leading, works, and, secrets, only, of, every, art, and, such, as, excite, wonder, for, wonder, is, engendered, by, rarity, since, that, which, is, rare, although, it, be, compounded, of, ordinary, natures, always, begets, wonder, on, the, contrary, that, which, is, really, wonderful, from, some, specific, difference, distinguishing, it, from, other, species, is, carelessly, observed, if, it, be, but, familiar, yet, the, singular, instances, of, art, should, be, observed, no, less, than, those, of, nature, which, we, have, before, spoken, of, and, as, in, the, latter, we, have, classed, the, sun, the, moon, the, magnet, and, the, like, all, of, them, most, familiar, to, us, but, yet, in, their, nature, singular, so, should, we, proceed, with, the, singular, instances, of, art, for, example, paper, a, very, common, substance, is, a, singular, instance, of, art, for, if, you, consider, the, subject, attentively, you, will, find, that, artificial, substances, are, either, woven, by, straight, and, transverse, lines, as, silk, woollen, or, linen, cloth, and, the, like, or, coagulated, from, concrete, juices, such, as, brick, earthenware, glass, enamel, porcelain, and, the, like, which, admit, of, a, polish, if, they, be, compact, but, if, not, become, hard, without, being, polished, all, which, latter, substances, are, brittle, and, not, adherent, or, tenacious, on, the, contrary, paper, is, a, tenacious, substance, which, can, be, cut, and, torn, so, as, to, resemble, and, almost, rival, the, skin, of, any, animal, or, the, leaf, of, vegetables, and, the, like, works, of, nature, being, neither, brittle, like, glass, nor, woven, like, cloth, but, having, fibres, and, not, distinct, threads, just, as, natural, substances, so, that, scarcely, anything, similar, can, be, found, among, artificial, substances, and, it, is, absolutely, singular, and, in, artificial, works, we, should, certainly, prefer, those, which, approach, the, nearest, to, an, imitation, of, nature, or, on, the, other, hand, powerfully, govern, and, change, her, course, again, in, these, instances, which, we, term, the, wit, and, hands, of, man, charms, and, conjuring, should, not, be, altogether, despised, for, although, mere, amusements, and, of, little, use, yet, they, may, afford, considerable, information, lastly, superstition, and, magic, (in, its, common, acceptation), are, not, to, be, entirely, omitted, for, although, they, be, overwhelmed, by, a, mass, of, lies, and, fables, yet, some, investigation, should, be, made, to, see, if, there, be, really, any, latent, natural, operation, in, them, as, in, fascination, and, the, fortifying, of, the, imagination, the, sympathy, of, distant, objects, the, transmission, of, impressions, from, spirit, to, spirit, no, less, than, from, body, to, body, and, the, like, from, the, foregoing, remarks, it, is, clear, that, the, last, five, species, of, instances, (the, similar, singular, deviating, and, bordering, instances, and, those, of, power), should, not, be, reserved, for, the, investigation, of, any, given, nature, as, the, preceding, and, many, of, the, succeeding, instances, must, but, a, collection, of, them, should, be, made, at, once, in, the, style, of, a, particular, history, so, that, they, may, arrange, the, matter, which, enters, the, understanding, and, correct, its, depraved, habit, for, it, is, necessarily, imbued, corrupted, perverted, and, distorted, by, daily, and, habitual, impressions, they, are, to, be, used, therefore, as, a, preparative, for, the, purpose, of, rectifying, and, purifying, the, understanding, for, whatever, withdraws, it, from, habit, levels, and, planes, down, its, surface, for, the, reception, of, the, dry, and, pure, light, of, true, notions, these, instances, moreover, level, and, prepare, the, way, for, the, operative, branch, as, we, will, mention, in, its, proper, place, when, speaking, of, the, practical, deductions, in, the, eleventh, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, accompanying, and, hostile, instances, these, are, such, as, exhibit, any, body, or, concrete, where, the, required, nature, is, constantly, found, as, an, inseparable, companion, or, on, the, contrary, where, the, required, nature, is, constantly, avoided, and, excluded, from, attendance, as, an, enemy, from, these, instances, may, be, formed, certain, and, universal, propositions, either, affirmative, or, negative, the, subject, of, which, will, be, the, concrete, body, and, the, predicate, the, required, nature, for, particular, propositions, are, by, no, means, fixed, when, the, required, nature, is, found, to, fluctuate, and, change, in, the, concrete, either, approaching, and, acquired, or, receding, and, laid, aside, hence, particular, propositions, have, no, great, prerogative, except, in, the, case, of, migration, of, which, we, have, spoken, above, yet, such, particular, propositions, are, of, great, use, when, compared, with, the, universal, as, will, be, mentioned, in, its, proper, place, nor, do, we, require, absolute, affirmation, or, negation, even, in, universal, propositions, for, if, the, exceptions, be, singular, or, rare, it, is, sufficient, for, our, purpose, the, use, of, accompanying, instances, is, to, narrow, the, affirmative, of, form, for, as, it, is, narrowed, by, the, migrating, instances, where, the, form, must, necessarily, be, something, communicated, or, destroyed, by, the, act, of, migration, so, it, is, narrowed, by, accompanying, instances, where, the, form, must, necessarily, be, something, which, enters, into, the, concretion, of, the, body, or, on, the, contrary, is, repugnant, to, it, and, one, who, is, well, acquainted, with, the, constitution, or, formation, of, the, body, will, not, be, far, from, bringing, to, light, the, form, of, the, required, nature, for, example, let, the, required, nature, be, heat, flame, is, an, accompanying, instance, for, in, water, air, stone, metal, and, many, other, substances, heat, is, variable, and, can, approach, or, retire, but, all, flame, is, hot, so, that, heat, always, accompanies, the, concretion, of, flame, we, have, no, hostile, instance, of, heat, for, the, senses, are, unacquainted, with, the, interior, of, the, earth, and, there, is, no, concretion, of, any, known, body, which, is, not, susceptible, of, heat, again, let, solidity, be, the, required, nature, air, is, a, hostile, instance, for, metals, may, be, liquid, or, solid, so, may, glass, even, water, may, become, solid, by, congelation, but, air, cannot, become, solid, or, lose, its, fluidity, with, regard, to, these, instances, of, fixed, propositions, there, are, two, points, to, be, observed, which, are, of, importance, first, that, if, there, be, no, universal, affirmative, or, negative, it, be, carefully, noted, as, not, existing, thus, in, heat, we, have, observed, that, there, exists, no, universal, negative, in, such, substances, at, least, as, have, come, to, our, knowledge, again, if, the, required, nature, be, eternity, or, incorruptibility, we, have, no, universal, affirmative, within, our, sphere, for, these, qualities, cannot, be, predicated, of, any, bodies, below, the, heavens, or, above, the, interior, of, the, earth, secondly, to, our, general, propositions, as, to, any, concrete, whether, affirmative, or, negative, we, should, subjoin, the, concretes, which, appear, to, approach, nearest, to, the, non-existing, substances, such, as, the, most, gentle, or, least-burning, flames, in, heat, or, gold, in, incorruptibility, since, it, approaches, nearest, to, it, for, they, all, serve, to, show, the, limit, of, existence, and, non-existence, and, circumscribe, forms, so, that, they, cannot, wander, beyond, the, conditions, of, matter, in, the, twelfth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, those, subjunctive, instances, of, which, we, spoke, in, the, last, aphorism, and, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, instances, of, extremity, or, limits, for, they, are, not, only, serviceable, when, subjoined, to, fixed, propositions, but, also, of, themselves, and, from, their, own, nature, they, indicate, with, sufficient, precision, the, real, divisions, of, nature, and, measures, of, things, and, the, “how, far”, nature, effects, or, allows, of, anything, and, her, passage, thence, to, something, else, such, are, gold, in, weight, iron, in, hardness, the, whale, in, the, size, of, animals, the, dog, in, smell, the, flame, of, gunpowder, in, rapid, expansion, and, others, of, a, like, nature, nor, are, we, to, pass, over, the, extremes, in, defect, as, well, as, in, abundance, as, spirits, of, wine, in, weight, the, touchstone, in, softness, the, worms, upon, the, skin, in, the, size, of, animals, and, the, like, in, the, thirteenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, those, of, alliance, or, union, they, are, such, as, mingle, and, unite, natures, held, to, be, heterogeneous, and, observed, and, marked, as, such, in, received, classifications, these, instances, show, that, the, operation, and, effect, which, is, considered, peculiar, to, some, one, of, such, heterogeneous, natures, may, also, be, attributed, to, another, nature, styled, heterogeneous, so, as, to, prove, that, the, difference, of, the, natures, is, not, real, nor, essential, but, a, mere, modification, of, a, common, nature, they, are, very, serviceable, therefore, in, elevating, and, carrying, on, the, mind, from, differences, to, genera, and, in, removing, those, phantoms, and, images, of, things, which, meet, it, in, disguise, in, concrete, substances, for, example, let, the, required, nature, be, heat, the, classification, of, heat, into, three, kinds, that, of, the, celestial, bodies, that, of, animals, and, that, of, fire, appears, to, be, settled, and, admitted, and, these, kinds, of, heat, especially, one, of, them, compared, with, the, other, two, are, supposed, to, be, different, and, clearly, heterogeneous, in, their, essence, and, species, or, specific, nature, since, the, heat, of, the, heavenly, bodies, and, of, animals, generates, and, cherishes, while, that, of, fire, corrupts, and, destroys, we, have, an, instance, of, alliance, then, in, a, very, common, experiment, that, of, a, vine, branch, admitted, into, a, building, where, there, is, a, constant, fire, by, which, the, grapes, ripen, a, whole, month, sooner, than, in, the, air, so, that, fruit, upon, the, tree, can, be, ripened, by, fire, although, this, appear, the, peculiar, effect, of, the, sun, from, this, beginning, therefore, the, understanding, rejects, all, essential, difference, and, easily, ascends, to, the, investigation, of, the, real, differences, between, the, heat, of, the, sun, and, that, of, fire, by, which, their, operation, is, rendered, dissimilar, although, they, partake, of, a, common, nature, these, differences, will, be, found, to, be, four, in, number, 1, the, heat, of, the, sun, is, much, milder, and, gentler, in, degree, than, that, of, fire, 2, it, is, much, more, moist, in, quality, especially, as, it, is, transmitted, to, us, through, the, air, 3, which, is, the, chief, point, it, is, very, unequal, advancing, and, increased, at, one, time, retiring, and, diminished, at, another, which, mainly, contributes, to, the, generation, of, bodies, for, aristotle, rightly, asserted, that, the, principal, cause, of, generation, and, corruption, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, was, the, oblique, path, of, the, sun, in, the, zodiac, whence, its, heat, becomes, very, unequal, partly, from, the, alternation, of, night, and, day, partly, from, the, succession, of, summer, and, winter, yet, must, he, immediately, corrupt, and, pervert, his, discovery, by, dictating, to, nature, according, to, his, habit, and, dogmatically, assigning, the, cause, of, generation, to, the, approach, of, the, sun, and, that, of, corruption, to, its, retreat, while, in, fact, each, circumstance, indifferently, and, not, respectively, contributes, both, to, generation, and, corruption, for, unequal, heat, tends, to, generate, and, corrupt, as, equable, heat, does, to, preserve, 4, the, fourth, difference, between, the, heat, of, the, sun, and, fire, is, of, great, consequence, namely, that, the, sun, gradually, and, for, a, length, of, time, insinuates, its, effects, while, those, of, fire, (urged, by, the, impatience, of, man), are, brought, to, a, termination, in, a, shorter, space, of, time, but, if, any, one, were, to, pay, attention, to, the, tempering, of, fire, and, reducing, it, to, a, more, moderate, and, gentle, degree, (which, may, be, done, in, various, ways), and, then, were, to, sprinkle, and, mix, a, degree, of, humidity, with, it, and, above, all, were, to, imitate, the, sun, in, its, inequality, and, lastly, were, patiently, to, suffer, some, delay, (not, such, however, as, is, proportioned, to, the, effects, of, the, sun, but, more, than, men, usually, admit, of, in, those, of, fire), he, would, soon, banish, the, notion, of, any, difference, and, would, attempt, or, equal, or, perhaps, sometimes, surpass, the, effect, of, the, sun, by, the, heat, of, fire, like, instance, of, alliance, is, that, of, reviving, butterflies, benumbed, and, nearly, dead, from, cold, by, the, gentle, warmth, of, fire, so, that, fire, is, no, less, able, to, revive, animals, than, to, ripen, vegetables, we, may, also, mention, the, celebrated, invention, of, fracastorius, of, applying, a, pan, considerably, heated, to, the, head, in, desperate, cases, of, apoplexy, which, clearly, expands, the, animal, spirits, when, compressed, and, almost, extinguished, by, the, humors, and, obstructions, of, the, brain, and, excites, them, to, action, as, the, fire, would, operate, on, water, or, air, and, in, the, result, produces, life, eggs, are, sometimes, hatched, by, the, heat, of, fire, an, exact, imitation, of, animal, heat, and, there, are, many, instances, of, the, like, nature, so, that, no, one, can, doubt, that, the, heat, of, fire, in, many, cases, can, be, modified, till, it, resemble, that, of, the, heavenly, bodies, and, of, animals, again, let, the, required, natures, be, motion, and, rest, there, appears, to, be, a, settled, classification, grounded, on, the, deepest, philosophy, that, natural, bodies, either, revolve, move, in, a, straight, line, or, stand, still, and, rest, for, there, is, either, motion, without, limit, or, continuance, within, a, certain, limit, or, a, translation, toward, a, certain, limit, the, eternal, motion, of, revolution, appears, peculiar, to, the, heavenly, bodies, rest, to, this, our, globe, and, the, other, bodies, (heavy, and, light, as, they, are, termed, that, is, to, say, placed, out, of, their, natural, position), are, borne, in, a, straight, line, to, masses, or, aggregates, which, resemble, them, the, light, toward, the, heaven, the, heavy, toward, the, earth, and, all, this, is, very, fine, language, but, we, have, an, instance, of, alliance, in, low, comets, which, revolve, though, far, below, the, heavens, and, the, fiction, of, aristotle, of, the, comet, being, fixed, to, or, necessarily, following, some, star, has, been, long, since, exploded, not, only, because, it, is, improbable, in, itself, but, from, the, evident, fact, of, the, discursive, and, irregular, motion, of, comets, through, various, parts, of, the, heavens, [125], another, instance, of, alliance, is, that, of, the, motion, of, air, which, appears, to, revolve, from, east, to, west, within, the, tropics, where, the, circles, of, revolution, are, the, greatest, the, flow, and, ebb, of, the, sea, would, perhaps, be, another, instance, if, the, water, were, once, found, to, have, a, motion, of, revolution, though, slow, and, hardly, perceptible, from, east, to, west, subject, however, to, a, reaction, twice, a, day, if, this, be, so, it, is, clear, that, the, motion, of, revolution, is, not, confined, to, the, celestial, bodies, but, is, shared, also, by, air, and, water, again--the, supposed, peculiar, disposition, of, light, bodies, to, rise, is, rather, shaken, and, here, we, may, find, an, instance, of, alliance, in, a, water, bubble, for, if, air, be, placed, under, water, it, rises, rapidly, toward, the, surface, by, that, striking, motion, (as, democritus, terms, it), with, which, the, descending, water, strikes, the, air, and, raises, it, not, by, any, struggle, or, effort, of, the, air, itself, and, when, it, has, reached, the, surface, of, the, water, it, is, prevented, from, ascending, any, further, by, the, slight, resistance, it, meets, with, in, the, water, which, does, not, allow, an, immediate, separation, of, its, parts, so, that, the, tendency, of, the, air, to, rise, must, be, very, slight, again, let, the, required, nature, be, weight, it, is, certainly, a, received, classification, that, dense, and, solid, bodies, are, borne, toward, the, centre, of, the, earth, and, rare, and, light, bodies, to, the, circumference, of, the, heavens, as, their, appropriate, places, as, far, as, relates, to, places, (though, these, things, have, much, weight, in, the, schools), the, notion, of, there, being, any, determinate, place, is, absurd, and, puerile, philosophers, trifle, therefore, when, they, tell, you, that, if, the, earth, were, perforated, heavy, bodies, would, stop, on, their, arrival, at, the, centre, this, centre, would, indeed, be, an, efficacious, nothing, or, mathematical, point, could, it, affect, bodies, or, be, sought, by, them, for, a, body, is, not, acted, upon, except, by, a, body, [126], in, fact, this, tendency, to, ascend, and, descend, is, either, in, the, conformation, of, the, moving, body, or, in, its, harmony, and, sympathy, with, another, body, but, if, any, dense, and, solid, body, be, found, which, does, not, however, tend, toward, the, earth, the, classification, is, at, an, end, now, if, we, allow, of, gilbert’s, opinion, that, the, magnetic, power, of, the, earth, in, attracting, heavy, bodies, is, not, extended, beyond, the, limit, of, its, peculiar, virtue, (which, operates, always, at, a, fixed, distance, and, no, further), [127], and, this, be, proved, by, some, instance, such, an, instance, will, be, one, of, alliance, in, our, present, subject, the, nearest, approach, to, it, is, that, of, waterspouts, frequently, seen, by, persons, navigating, the, atlantic, toward, either, of, the, indies, for, the, force, and, mass, of, the, water, suddenly, effused, by, waterspouts, appears, to, be, so, considerable, that, the, water, must, have, been, collected, previously, and, have, remained, fixed, where, it, was, formed, until, it, was, afterward, forced, down, by, some, violent, cause, rather, than, made, to, fall, by, the, natural, motion, of, gravity, so, that, it, may, be, conjectured, that, a, dense, and, compact, mass, at, a, great, distance, from, the, earth, may, be, suspended, as, the, earth, itself, is, and, would, not, fall, unless, forced, down, we, do, not, however, affirm, this, as, certain, in, the, meanwhile, both, in, this, respect, and, many, others, it, will, readily, be, seen, how, deficient, we, are, in, natural, history, since, we, are, forced, to, have, recourse, to, suppositions, for, examples, instead, of, ascertained, instances, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, discursive, power, of, the, mind, the, classification, of, human, reason, and, animal, instinct, appears, to, be, perfectly, correct, yet, there, are, some, instances, of, the, actions, of, brutes, which, seem, to, show, that, they, too, can, syllogize, thus, it, is, related, that, a, crow, which, had, nearly, perished, from, thirst, in, a, great, drought, saw, some, water, in, the, hollow, trunk, of, a, tree, but, as, it, was, too, narrow, for, him, to, get, into, it, he, continued, to, throw, in, pebbles, which, made, the, water, rise, till, he, could, drink, and, it, afterward, became, a, proverb, again, let, the, required, nature, be, vision, the, classification, appears, real, and, certain, which, considers, light, as, that, which, is, originally, visible, and, confers, the, power, of, seeing, and, color, as, being, secondarily, visible, and, not, capable, of, being, seen, without, light, so, as, to, appear, a, mere, image, or, modification, of, light, yet, there, are, instances, of, alliance, in, each, respect, as, in, snow, when, in, great, quantities, and, in, the, flame, of, sulphur, the, one, being, a, color, originally, and, in, itself, light, the, other, a, light, verging, toward, color, [128], in, the, fourteenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, instances, of, the, cross, borrowing, our, metaphor, from, the, crosses, erected, where, two, roads, meet, to, point, out, the, different, directions, we, are, wont, also, to, call, them, decisive, and, judicial, instances, and, in, some, cases, instances, of, the, oracle, and, of, command, their, nature, is, as, follows, when, in, investigating, any, nature, the, understanding, is, as, it, were, balanced, and, uncertain, to, which, of, two, or, more, natures, the, cause, of, the, required, nature, should, be, assigned, on, account, of, the, frequent, and, usual, concurrence, of, several, natures, the, instances, of, the, cross, show, that, the, union, of, one, nature, with, the, required, nature, is, firm, and, indissoluble, while, that, of, the, other, is, unsteady, and, separable, by, which, means, the, question, is, decided, and, the, first, is, received, as, the, cause, while, the, other, is, dismissed, and, rejected, such, instances, therefore, afford, great, light, and, are, of, great, weight, so, that, the, course, of, interpretation, sometimes, terminates, and, is, completed, in, them, sometimes, however, they, are, found, among, the, instances, already, observed, but, they, are, generally, new, being, expressly, and, purposely, sought, for, and, applied, and, brought, to, light, only, by, attentive, and, active, diligence, for, example, let, the, required, nature, be, the, flow, and, ebb, of, the, sea, which, is, repeated, twice, a, day, at, intervals, of, six, hours, between, each, advance, and, retreat, with, some, little, difference, agreeing, with, the, motion, of, the, moon, we, have, here, the, following, crossways, this, motion, must, be, occasioned, either, by, the, advancing, and, the, retiring, of, the, sea, like, water, shaken, in, a, basin, which, leaves, one, side, while, it, washes, the, other, or, by, the, rising, of, the, sea, from, the, bottom, and, its, again, subsiding, like, boiling, water, but, a, doubt, arises, to, which, of, these, causes, we, should, assign, the, flow, and, ebb, if, the, first, assertion, be, admitted, it, follows, that, when, there, is, a, flood, on, one, side, there, must, at, the, same, time, be, an, ebb, on, another, and, the, question, therefore, is, reduced, to, this, now, acosta, and, some, others, after, a, diligent, inquiry, have, observed, that, the, flood, tide, takes, place, on, the, coast, of, florida, and, the, opposite, coasts, of, spain, and, africa, at, the, same, time, as, does, also, the, ebb, and, that, there, is, not, on, the, contrary, a, flood, tide, at, florida, when, there, is, an, ebb, on, the, coasts, of, spain, and, africa, yet, if, one, consider, the, subject, attentively, this, does, not, prove, the, necessity, of, a, rising, motion, nor, refute, the, notion, of, a, progressive, motion, for, the, motion, may, be, progressive, and, yet, inundate, the, opposite, shores, of, a, channel, at, the, same, time, as, if, the, waters, be, forced, and, driven, together, from, some, other, quarter, for, instance, which, takes, place, in, rivers, for, they, flow, and, ebb, toward, each, bank, at, the, same, time, yet, their, motion, is, clearly, progressive, being, that, of, the, waters, from, the, sea, entering, their, mouths, so, it, may, happen, that, the, waters, coming, in, a, vast, body, from, the, eastern, indian, ocean, are, driven, together, and, forced, into, the, channel, of, the, atlantic, and, therefore, inundate, both, coasts, at, once, we, must, inquire, therefore, if, there, be, any, other, channel, by, which, the, waters, can, at, the, same, time, sink, and, ebb, and, the, southern, ocean, at, once, suggests, itself, which, is, not, less, than, the, atlantic, but, rather, broader, and, more, extensive, than, is, requisite, for, this, effect, we, at, length, arrive, then, at, an, instance, of, the, cross, which, is, this, if, it, be, positively, discovered, that, when, the, flood, sets, in, toward, the, opposite, coasts, of, florida, and, spain, in, the, atlantic, there, is, at, the, same, time, a, flood, tide, on, the, coasts, of, peru, and, the, back, part, of, china, in, the, southern, ocean, then, assuredly, from, this, decisive, instance, we, must, reject, the, assertion, that, the, flood, and, ebb, of, the, sea, about, which, we, inquire, takes, place, by, progressive, motion, for, no, other, sea, or, place, is, left, where, there, can, be, an, ebb, but, this, may, most, easily, be, learned, by, inquiring, of, the, inhabitants, of, panama, and, lima, (where, the, two, oceans, are, separated, by, a, narrow, isthmus), whether, the, flood, and, ebb, takes, place, on, the, opposite, sides, of, the, isthmus, at, the, same, time, or, the, reverse, this, decision, or, rejection, appears, certain, if, it, be, granted, that, the, earth, is, fixed, but, if, the, earth, revolves, it, may, perhaps, happen, that, from, the, unequal, revolution, (as, regards, velocity), of, the, earth, and, the, waters, of, the, sea, there, may, be, a, violent, forcing, of, the, waters, into, a, mass, forming, the, flood, and, a, subsequent, relaxation, of, them, (when, they, can, no, longer, bear, the, accumulation), forming, the, ebb, separate, inquiry, must, be, made, into, this, even, with, this, hypothesis, however, it, remains, equally, true, that, there, must, be, an, ebb, somewhere, at, the, same, time, that, there, is, a, flood, in, another, quarter, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, latter, of, the, two, motions, we, have, supposed, namely, that, of, a, rising, and, subsiding, motion, if, it, should, happen, that, upon, diligent, examination, the, progressive, motion, be, rejected, we, have, then, three, ways, before, us, with, regard, to, this, nature, the, motion, by, which, the, waters, raise, themselves, and, again, fall, back, in, the, floods, and, ebbs, without, the, addition, of, any, other, water, rolled, toward, them, must, take, place, in, one, of, the, three, following, ways, either, the, supply, of, water, emanates, from, the, interior, of, the, earth, and, returns, back, again, or, there, is, really, no, greater, quantity, of, water, but, the, same, water, (without, any, augmentation, of, its, quantity), is, extended, or, rarefied, so, as, to, occupy, a, greater, space, and, dimension, and, again, contracts, itself, or, there, is, neither, an, additional, supply, nor, any, extension, but, the, same, waters, (with, regard, to, quantity, density, or, rarity), raise, themselves, and, fall, from, sympathy, by, some, magnetic, power, attracting, and, calling, them, up, as, it, were, from, above, let, us, then, (passing, over, the, first, two, motions), reduce, the, investigation, to, the, last, and, inquire, if, there, be, any, such, elevation, of, the, water, by, sympathy, or, a, magnetic, force, and, it, is, evident, in, the, first, place, that, the, whole, mass, of, water, being, placed, in, the, trench, or, cavity, of, the, sea, cannot, be, raised, at, once, because, there, would, not, be, enough, to, cover, the, bottom, so, that, if, there, be, any, tendency, of, this, kind, in, the, water, to, raise, itself, yet, it, would, be, interrupted, and, checked, by, the, cohesion, of, things, or, (as, the, common, expression, is), that, there, may, be, no, vacuum, the, water, therefore, must, rise, on, one, side, and, for, that, reason, be, diminished, and, ebb, on, another, but, it, will, again, necessarily, follow, that, the, magnetic, power, not, being, able, to, operate, on, the, whole, operates, most, intensely, on, the, centre, so, as, to, raise, the, waters, there, which, when, thus, raised, successively, desert, and, abandon, the, sides, [129], we, at, length, arrive, then, at, an, instance, of, the, cross, which, is, this, if, it, be, found, that, during, the, ebb, the, surface, of, the, waters, at, sea, is, more, curved, and, round, from, the, waters, rising, in, the, middle, and, sinking, at, the, sides, or, coast, and, if, during, a, flood, it, be, more, even, and, level, from, the, waters, returning, to, their, former, position, then, assuredly, by, this, decisive, instance, the, raising, of, them, by, a, magnetic, force, can, be, admitted, if, otherwise, it, must, be, entirely, rejected, it, is, not, difficult, to, make, the, experiment, (by, sounding, in, straits), whether, the, sea, be, deeper, toward, the, middle, in, ebbs, than, in, floods, but, it, must, be, observed, if, this, be, the, case, that, (contrary, to, common, opinion), the, waters, rise, in, ebbs, and, only, return, to, their, former, position, in, floods, so, as, to, bathe, and, inundate, the, coast, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, spontaneous, motion, of, revolution, and, particularly, whether, the, diurnal, motion, by, which, the, sun, and, stars, appear, to, us, to, rise, and, set, be, a, real, motion, of, revolution, in, the, heavenly, bodies, or, only, apparent, in, them, and, real, in, the, earth, there, may, be, an, instance, of, the, cross, of, the, following, nature, if, there, be, discovered, any, motion, in, the, ocean, from, east, to, west, though, very, languid, and, weak, and, if, the, same, motion, be, discovered, rather, more, swift, in, the, air, (particularly, within, the, tropics, where, it, is, more, perceptible, from, the, circles, being, greater), if, it, be, discovered, also, in, the, low, comets, and, be, already, quick, and, powerful, in, them, if, it, be, found, also, in, the, planets, but, so, tempered, and, regulated, as, to, be, slower, in, those, nearest, the, earth, and, quicker, in, those, at, the, greatest, distance, being, quickest, of, all, in, the, heavens, then, the, diurnal, motion, should, certainly, be, considered, as, real, in, the, heavens, and, that, of, the, earth, must, be, rejected, for, it, will, be, evident, that, the, motion, from, east, to, west, is, part, of, the, system, of, the, world, and, universal, since, it, is, most, rapid, in, the, height, of, the, heavens, and, gradually, grows, weaker, till, it, stops, and, is, extinguished, in, rest, at, the, earth, again, let, the, required, nature, be, that, other, motion, of, revolution, so, celebrated, among, astronomers, which, is, contrary, to, the, diurnal, namely, from, west, to, east--and, which, the, ancient, astronomers, assign, to, the, planets, and, even, to, the, starry, sphere, but, copernicus, and, his, followers, to, the, earth, also--and, let, it, be, examined, whether, any, such, motion, be, found, in, nature, or, it, be, rather, a, fiction, and, hypothesis, for, abridging, and, facilitating, calculation, and, for, promoting, that, fine, notion, of, effecting, the, heavenly, motions, by, perfect, circles, for, there, is, nothing, which, proves, such, a, motion, in, heavenly, objects, to, be, true, and, real, either, in, a, planet’s, not, returning, in, its, diurnal, motion, to, the, same, point, of, the, starry, sphere, or, in, the, pole, of, the, zodiac, being, different, from, that, of, the, world, which, two, circumstances, have, occasioned, this, notion, for, the, first, phenomenon, is, well, accounted, for, by, the, spheres, overtaking, or, falling, behind, each, other, and, the, second, by, spiral, lines, so, that, the, inaccuracy, of, the, return, and, declination, to, the, tropics, may, be, rather, modifications, of, the, one, diurnal, motion, than, contrary, motions, or, about, different, poles, and, it, is, most, certain, if, we, consider, ourselves, for, a, moment, as, part, of, the, vulgar, (setting, aside, the, fictions, of, astronomers, and, the, school, who, are, wont, undeservedly, to, attack, the, senses, in, many, respects, and, to, affect, obscurity), that, the, apparent, motion, is, such, as, we, have, said, a, model, of, which, we, have, sometimes, caused, to, be, represented, by, wires, in, a, sort, of, a, machine, we, may, take, the, following, instances, of, the, cross, upon, this, subject, if, it, be, found, in, any, history, worthy, of, credit, that, there, has, existed, any, comet, high, or, low, which, has, not, revolved, in, manifest, harmony, (however, irregularly), with, the, diurnal, motion, then, we, may, decide, so, far, as, to, allow, such, a, motion, to, be, possible, in, nature, but, if, nothing, of, the, sort, be, found, it, must, be, suspected, and, recourse, must, be, had, to, other, instances, of, the, cross, again, let, the, required, nature, be, weight, or, gravity, heavy, and, ponderous, bodies, must, either, of, their, own, nature, tend, toward, the, centre, of, the, earth, by, their, peculiar, formation, or, must, be, attracted, and, hurried, by, the, corporeal, mass, of, the, earth, itself, as, being, an, assemblage, of, similar, bodies, and, be, drawn, to, it, by, sympathy, but, if, the, latter, be, the, cause, it, follows, that, the, nearer, bodies, approach, to, the, earth, the, more, powerfully, and, rapidly, they, must, be, borne, toward, it, and, the, further, they, are, distant, the, more, faintly, and, slowly, (as, is, the, case, in, magnetic, attractions), and, that, this, must, happen, within, a, given, distance, so, that, if, they, be, separated, at, such, a, distance, from, the, earth, that, the, power, of, the, earth, cannot, act, upon, them, they, will, remain, suspended, like, the, earth, and, not, fall, at, all, [130], the, following, instance, of, the, cross, may, be, adopted, take, a, clock, moved, by, leaden, weights, [131], and, another, by, a, spring, and, let, them, be, set, well, together, so, that, one, be, neither, quicker, nor, slower, than, the, other, then, let, the, clock, moved, by, weights, be, placed, on, the, top, of, a, very, high, church, and, the, other, be, kept, below, and, let, it, be, well, observed, if, the, former, move, slower, than, it, did, from, the, diminished, power, of, the, weights, let, the, same, experiment, be, made, at, the, bottom, of, mines, worked, to, a, considerable, depth, in, order, to, see, whether, the, clock, move, more, quickly, from, the, increased, power, of, the, weights, but, if, this, power, be, found, to, diminish, at, a, height, and, to, increase, in, subterraneous, places, the, attraction, of, the, corporeal, mass, of, the, earth, may, be, taken, as, the, cause, of, weight, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, polarity, of, the, steel, needle, when, touched, with, the, magnet, we, have, these, two, ways, with, regard, to, this, nature--either, the, touch, of, the, magnet, must, communicate, polarity, to, the, steel, toward, the, north, and, south, or, else, it, may, only, excite, and, prepare, it, while, the, actual, motion, is, occasioned, by, the, presence, of, the, earth, which, gilbert, considers, to, be, the, case, and, endeavors, to, prove, with, so, much, labor, the, particulars, he, has, inquired, into, with, such, ingenious, zeal, amount, to, this--1, an, iron, bolt, placed, for, a, long, time, toward, the, north, and, south, acquires, polarity, from, this, habit, without, the, touch, of, the, magnet, as, if, the, earth, itself, operating, but, weakly, from, its, distance, (for, the, surface, or, outer, crust, of, the, earth, does, not, in, his, opinion, possess, the, magnetic, power), yet, by, long, continued, motion, could, supply, the, place, of, the, magnet, excite, the, iron, and, convert, and, change, it, when, excited, 2, iron, at, a, red, or, white, heat, when, quenched, in, a, direction, parallel, to, the, north, and, south, also, acquires, polarity, without, the, touch, of, the, magnet, as, if, the, parts, of, iron, being, put, in, motion, by, ignition, and, afterward, recovering, themselves, were, at, the, moment, of, being, quenched, more, susceptible, and, sensitive, of, the, power, emanating, from, the, earth, than, at, other, times, and, therefore, as, it, were, excited, but, these, points, though, well, observed, do, not, completely, prove, his, assertion, an, instance, of, the, cross, on, this, point, might, be, as, follows, let, a, small, magnetic, globe, be, taken, and, its, poles, marked, and, placed, toward, the, east, and, west, not, toward, the, north, and, south, and, let, it, continue, thus, then, let, an, untouched, needle, be, placed, over, it, and, suffered, to, remain, so, for, six, or, seven, days, now, the, needle, (for, this, is, not, disputed), while, it, remains, over, the, magnet, will, leave, the, poles, of, the, world, and, turn, to, those, of, the, magnet, and, therefore, as, long, as, it, remains, in, the, above, position, will, turn, to, the, east, and, west, but, if, the, needle, when, removed, from, the, magnet, and, placed, upon, a, pivot, be, found, immediately, to, turn, to, the, north, and, south, or, even, by, degrees, to, return, thither, then, the, presence, of, the, earth, must, be, considered, as, the, cause, but, if, it, remains, turned, as, at, first, toward, the, east, and, west, or, lose, its, polarity, then, that, cause, must, be, suspected, and, further, inquiry, made, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, corporeal, substance, of, the, moon, whether, it, be, rare, fiery, and, aërial, (as, most, of, the, ancient, philosophers, have, thought), or, solid, and, dense, (as, gilbert, and, many, of, the, moderns, with, some, of, the, ancients, hold), [132], the, reasons, for, this, latter, opinion, are, grounded, chiefly, upon, this, that, the, moon, reflects, the, sun’s, rays, and, that, light, does, not, appear, capable, of, being, reflected, except, by, solids, the, instances, of, the, cross, will, therefore, (if, any), be, such, as, to, exhibit, reflection, by, a, rare, body, such, as, flame, if, it, be, but, sufficiently, dense, now, certainly, one, of, the, reasons, of, twilight, is, the, reflection[133], of, the, rays, of, the, sun, by, the, upper, part, of, the, atmosphere, we, see, the, sun’s, rays, also, reflected, on, fine, evenings, by, streaks, of, moist, clouds, with, a, splendor, not, less, but, perhaps, more, bright, and, glorious, than, that, reflected, from, the, body, of, the, moon, and, yet, it, is, not, clear, that, those, clouds, have, formed, into, a, dense, body, of, water, we, see, also, that, the, dark, air, behind, the, windows, at, night, reflects, the, light, of, a, candle, in, the, same, manner, as, a, dense, body, would, do, [134], the, experiment, should, also, be, made, of, causing, the, sun’s, rays, to, fall, through, a, hole, upon, some, dark, and, bluish, flame, the, unconfined, rays, of, the, sun, when, falling, on, faint, flames, do, certainly, appear, to, deaden, them, and, render, them, more, like, white, smoke, than, flames, these, are, the, only, instances, which, occur, at, present, of, the, nature, of, those, of, the, cross, and, better, perhaps, can, be, found, but, it, must, always, be, observed, that, reflection, is, not, to, be, expected, from, flame, unless, it, be, of, some, depth, for, otherwise, it, becomes, nearly, transparent, this, at, least, may, be, considered, certain, that, light, is, always, either, received, and, transmitted, or, reflected, by, an, even, surface, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, motion, of, projectiles, (such, as, darts, arrows, and, balls), through, the, air, the, school, in, its, usual, manner, treats, this, very, carelessly, considering, it, enough, to, distinguish, it, by, the, name, of, violent, motion, from, that, which, they, term, natural, and, as, far, as, regards, the, first, percussion, or, impulse, satisfies, itself, by, its, axiom, that, two, bodies, cannot, exist, in, one, place, or, there, would, be, a, penetration, of, dimensions, with, regard, to, this, nature, we, have, these, two, crossways--the, motion, must, arise, either, from, the, air, carrying, the, projected, body, and, collecting, behind, it, like, a, stream, behind, boats, or, the, wind, behind, straws, or, from, the, parts, of, the, body, itself, not, supporting, the, impression, but, pushing, themselves, forward, in, succession, to, ease, it, fracastorius, and, nearly, all, those, who, have, entered, into, any, refined, inquiry, upon, the, subject, adopt, the, first, nor, can, it, be, doubted, that, the, air, has, some, effect, yet, the, other, motion, is, without, doubt, real, as, is, clear, from, a, vast, number, of, experiments, among, others, we, may, take, this, instance, of, the, cross, namely, that, a, thin, plate, or, wire, of, iron, rather, stiff, or, even, a, reed, or, pen, split, in, two, when, drawn, up, and, bent, between, the, finger, and, thumb, will, leap, forward, for, it, is, clear, that, this, cannot, be, attributed, to, the, air’s, being, collected, behind, the, body, because, the, source, of, motion, is, in, the, centre, of, the, plate, or, pen, and, not, in, its, extremities, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, rapid, and, powerful, motion, of, the, explosion, of, gunpowder, by, which, such, vast, masses, are, upheaved, and, such, weights, discharged, as, we, observe, in, large, mines, and, mortars, there, are, two, crossways, before, us, with, regard, to, this, nature, this, motion, is, excited, either, by, the, mere, effort, of, the, body, expanding, itself, when, inflamed, or, by, the, assisting, effort, of, the, crude, spirit, which, escapes, rapidly, from, fire, and, bursts, violently, from, the, surrounding, flame, as, from, a, prison, the, school, however, and, common, opinion, only, consider, the, first, effort, for, men, think, that, they, are, great, philosophers, when, they, assert, that, flame, from, the, form, of, the, element, is, endowed, with, a, kind, of, necessity, of, occupying, a, greater, space, than, the, same, body, had, occupied, when, in, the, form, of, powder, and, that, thence, proceeds, the, motion, in, question, in, the, meantime, they, do, not, observe, that, although, this, may, be, true, on, the, supposition, of, flame, being, generated, yet, the, generation, may, be, impeded, by, a, weight, of, sufficient, force, to, compress, and, suffocate, it, so, that, no, such, necessity, exists, as, they, assert, they, are, right, indeed, in, imagining, that, the, expansion, and, the, consequent, emission, or, removal, of, the, opposing, body, is, necessary, if, flame, be, once, generated, but, such, a, necessity, is, avoided, if, the, solid, opposing, mass, suppress, the, flame, before, it, be, generated, and, we, in, fact, see, that, flame, especially, at, the, moment, of, its, generation, is, mild, and, gentle, and, requires, a, hollow, space, where, it, can, play, and, try, its, force, the, great, violence, of, the, effect, therefore, cannot, be, attributed, to, this, cause, but, the, truth, is, that, the, generation, of, these, exploding, flames, and, fiery, blasts, arises, from, the, conflict, of, two, bodies, of, a, decidedly, opposite, nature--the, one, very, inflammable, as, is, the, sulphur, the, other, having, an, antipathy, to, flame, namely, the, crude, spirit, of, the, nitre, so, that, an, extraordinary, conflict, takes, place, while, the, sulphur, is, becoming, inflamed, as, far, as, it, can, (for, the, third, body, the, willow, charcoal, merely, incorporates, and, conveniently, unites, the, two, others), and, the, spirit, of, nitre, is, escaping, as, far, also, as, it, can, and, at, the, same, time, expanding, itself, (for, air, and, all, crude, substances, and, water, are, expanded, by, heat), fanning, thus, in, every, direction, the, flame, of, the, sulphur, by, its, escape, and, violence, just, as, if, by, invisible, bellows, two, kinds, of, instances, of, the, cross, might, here, be, used--the, one, of, very, inflammable, substances, such, as, sulphur, and, camphor, naphtha, and, the, like, and, their, compounds, which, take, fire, more, readily, and, easily, than, gunpowder, if, left, to, themselves, (and, this, shows, that, the, effort, to, catch, fire, does, not, of, itself, produce, such, a, prodigious, effect), the, other, of, substances, which, avoid, and, repel, flame, such, as, all, salts, for, we, see, that, when, they, are, cast, into, the, fire, the, aqueous, spirit, escapes, with, a, crackling, noise, before, flame, is, produced, which, also, happens, in, a, less, degree, in, stiff, leaves, from, the, escape, of, the, aqueous, part, before, the, oily, part, has, caught, fire, this, is, more, particularly, observed, in, quicksilver, which, is, not, improperly, called, mineral, water, and, which, without, any, inflammation, nearly, equals, the, force, of, gunpowder, by, simple, explosion, and, expansion, and, is, said, when, mixed, with, gunpowder, to, increase, its, force, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, transitory, nature, of, flame, and, its, momentaneous, extinction, for, to, us, the, nature, of, flame, does, not, appear, to, be, fixed, or, settled, but, to, be, generated, from, moment, to, moment, and, to, be, every, instant, extinguished, it, being, clear, that, those, flames, which, continue, and, last, do, not, owe, their, continuance, to, the, same, mass, of, flame, but, to, a, continued, succession, of, new, flame, regularly, generated, and, that, the, same, identical, flame, does, not, continue, this, is, easily, shown, by, removing, the, food, or, source, of, the, flame, when, it, at, once, goes, out, we, have, the, two, following, crossways, with, regard, to, this, nature, this, momentary, nature, either, arises, from, the, cessation, of, the, cause, which, first, produced, it, as, in, light, sounds, and, violent, motions, as, they, are, termed, or, flame, may, be, capable, by, its, own, nature, of, duration, but, is, subjected, to, some, violence, from, the, contrary, natures, which, surround, it, and, is, destroyed, we, may, therefore, adopt, the, following, instance, of, the, cross, we, see, to, what, a, height, the, flames, rise, in, great, conflagrations, for, as, the, base, of, the, flame, becomes, more, extensive, its, vertex, is, more, lofty, it, appears, then, that, the, commencement, of, the, extinction, takes, place, at, the, sides, where, the, flame, is, compressed, by, the, air, and, is, ill, at, ease, but, the, centre, of, the, flame, which, is, untouched, by, the, air, and, surrounded, by, flame, continues, the, same, and, is, not, extinguished, until, compressed, by, degrees, by, the, air, attacking, it, from, the, sides, all, flame, therefore, is, pyramidal, having, its, base, near, the, source, and, its, vertex, pointed, from, its, being, resisted, by, the, air, and, not, supplied, from, the, source, on, the, contrary, the, smoke, which, is, narrow, at, the, base, expands, in, its, ascent, and, resembles, an, inverted, pyramid, because, the, air, admits, the, smoke, but, compresses, the, flame, for, let, no, one, dream, that, the, lighted, flame, is, air, since, they, are, clearly, heterogeneous, the, instance, of, the, cross, will, be, more, accurate, if, the, experiment, can, be, made, by, flames, of, different, colors, take, therefore, a, small, metal, sconce, and, place, a, lighted, taper, in, it, then, put, it, in, a, basin, and, pour, a, small, quantity, of, spirits, of, wine, round, the, sconce, so, as, not, to, reach, its, edge, and, light, the, spirit, now, the, flame, of, the, spirit, will, be, blue, and, that, of, the, taper, yellow, observe, therefore, whether, the, latter, (which, can, easily, be, distinguished, from, the, former, by, its, color, for, flames, do, not, mix, immediately, as, liquids, do), continue, pyramidal, or, tend, more, to, a, globular, figure, since, there, is, nothing, to, destroy, or, compress, it, if, the, latter, result, be, observed, it, must, be, considered, as, settled, that, flame, continues, positively, the, same, while, inclosed, within, another, flame, and, not, exposed, to, the, resisting, force, of, the, air, let, this, suffice, for, the, instances, of, the, cross, we, have, dwelt, the, longer, upon, them, in, order, gradually, to, teach, and, accustom, mankind, to, judge, of, nature, by, these, instances, and, enlightening, experiments, and, not, by, probable, reasons, [135], we, will, treat, of, the, instances, of, divorce, as, the, fifteenth, of, our, prerogative, instances, they, indicate, the, separation, of, natures, of, the, most, common, occurrence, they, differ, however, from, those, subjoined, to, the, accompanying, instances, for, the, instances, of, divorce, point, out, the, separation, of, a, particular, nature, from, some, concrete, substance, with, which, it, is, usually, found, in, conjunction, while, the, hostile, instances, point, out, the, total, separation, of, one, nature, from, another, they, differ, also, from, the, instances, of, the, cross, because, they, decide, nothing, but, only, inform, us, that, the, one, nature, is, capable, of, being, separated, from, the, other, they, are, of, use, in, exposing, false, forms, and, dissipating, hasty, theories, derived, from, obvious, facts, so, that, they, add, ballast, and, weight, as, it, were, to, the, understanding, for, instance, let, the, acquired, natures, be, those, four, which, telesius, terms, associates, and, of, the, same, family, namely, heat, light, rarity, and, mobility, or, promptitude, to, motion, yet, many, instances, of, divorce, can, be, discovered, between, them, air, is, rare, and, easily, moved, but, neither, hot, nor, light, the, moon, is, light, but, not, hot, boiling, water, is, warm, but, not, light, the, motion, of, the, needle, in, the, compass, is, swift, and, active, and, yet, its, substance, is, cold, dense, and, opaque, and, there, are, many, similar, examples, again, let, the, required, natures, be, corporeal, nature, and, natural, action, the, latter, appears, incapable, of, subsisting, without, some, body, yet, may, we, perhaps, even, here, find, an, instance, of, divorce, as, in, the, magnetic, motion, which, draws, the, iron, to, the, magnet, and, heavy, bodies, to, the, globe, of, the, earth, to, which, we, may, add, other, actions, which, operate, at, a, distance, for, such, action, takes, place, in, time, by, distinct, moments, not, in, an, instant, and, in, space, by, regular, degrees, and, distances, there, is, therefore, some, one, moment, of, time, and, some, interval, of, space, in, which, the, power, or, action, is, suspended, between, the, two, bodies, creating, the, motion, our, consideration, then, is, reduced, to, this, whether, the, bodies, which, are, the, extremes, of, motion, prepare, or, alter, the, intermediate, bodies, so, that, the, power, advances, from, one, extreme, to, the, other, by, succession, and, actual, contact, and, in, the, meantime, exists, in, some, intermediate, body, or, whether, there, exists, in, reality, nothing, but, the, bodies, the, power, and, the, space, in, the, case, of, the, rays, of, light, sounds, and, heat, and, some, other, objects, which, operate, at, a, distance, it, is, indeed, probable, that, the, intermediate, bodies, are, prepared, and, altered, the, more, so, because, a, qualified, medium, is, required, for, their, operation, but, the, magnetic, or, attractive, power, admits, of, an, indifferent, medium, and, it, is, not, impeded, in, any, but, if, that, power, or, action, is, independent, of, the, intermediate, body, it, follows, that, it, is, a, natural, power, or, action, existing, in, a, certain, time, and, space, without, any, body, since, it, exists, neither, in, the, extreme, nor, in, the, intermediate, bodies, hence, the, magnetic, action, may, be, taken, as, an, instance, of, divorce, of, corporeal, nature, and, natural, action, to, which, we, may, add, as, a, corollary, and, an, advantage, not, to, be, neglected, that, it, may, be, taken, as, a, proof, of, essence, and, substance, being, separate, and, incorporeal, even, by, those, who, philosophize, according, to, the, senses, for, if, natural, power, and, action, emanating, from, a, body, can, exist, at, any, time, and, place, entirely, without, any, body, it, is, nearly, a, proof, that, it, can, also, emanate, originally, from, an, incorporeal, substance, for, a, corporeal, nature, appears, to, be, no, less, necessary, for, supporting, and, conveying, than, for, exciting, or, generating, natural, action, next, follow, five, classes, of, instances, which, we, are, wont, to, call, by, the, general, term, of, instances, of, the, lamp, or, of, immediate, information, they, are, such, as, assist, the, senses, for, since, every, interpretation, of, nature, sets, out, from, the, senses, and, leads, by, a, regular, fixed, and, well-established, road, from, the, perceptions, of, the, senses, to, those, of, the, understanding, (which, are, true, notions, and, axioms), it, necessarily, follows, that, in, proportion, as, the, representatives, or, ministerings, of, the, senses, are, more, abundant, and, accurate, everything, else, must, be, more, easy, and, successful, the, first, of, these, five, sets, of, instances, of, the, lamp, strengthen, enlarge, and, correct, the, immediate, operations, of, the, senses, the, second, reduce, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, such, matters, as, are, beyond, it, the, third, indicate, the, continued, process, or, series, of, such, things, and, motions, as, for, the, most, part, are, only, observed, in, their, termination, or, in, periods, the, fourth, supply, the, absolute, wants, of, the, senses, the, fifth, excite, their, attention, and, observation, and, at, the, same, time, limit, the, subtilty, of, things, we, will, now, proceed, to, speak, of, them, singly, in, the, sixteenth, rank, then, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, instances, of, the, door, or, gate, by, which, name, we, designate, such, as, assist, the, immediate, action, of, the, senses, it, is, obvious, that, sight, holds, the, first, rank, among, the, senses, with, regard, to, information, for, which, reason, we, must, seek, principally, helps, for, that, sense, these, helps, appear, to, be, threefold, either, to, enable, it, to, perceive, objects, not, naturally, seen, or, to, see, them, from, a, greater, distance, or, to, see, them, more, accurately, and, distinctly, we, have, an, example, of, the, first, (not, to, speak, of, spectacles, and, the, like, which, only, correct, and, remove, the, infirmity, of, a, deficient, sight, and, therefore, give, no, further, information), in, the, lately, invented, microscopes, which, exhibit, the, latent, and, invisible, minutiæ, of, substances, and, their, hidden, formation, and, motion, by, wonderfully, increasing, their, apparent, magnitude, by, their, assistance, we, behold, with, astonishment, the, accurate, form, and, outline, of, a, flea, moss, and, animalculæ, as, well, as, their, previously, invisible, color, and, motion, it, is, said, also, that, an, apparently, straight, line, drawn, with, a, pen, or, pencil, is, discovered, by, such, a, microscope, to, be, very, uneven, and, curved, because, neither, the, motion, of, the, hand, when, assisted, by, a, ruler, nor, the, impression, of, ink, or, color, are, really, regular, although, the, irregularities, are, so, minute, as, not, to, be, perceptible, without, the, assistance, of, the, microscope, men, have, (as, is, usual, in, new, and, wonderful, discoveries), added, a, superstitious, remark, that, the, microscope, sheds, a, lustre, on, the, works, of, nature, and, dishonor, on, those, of, art, which, only, means, that, the, tissue, of, nature, is, much, more, delicate, than, that, of, art, for, the, microscope, is, only, of, use, for, minute, objects, and, democritus, perhaps, if, he, had, seen, it, would, have, exulted, in, the, thought, of, a, means, being, discovered, for, seeing, his, atom, which, he, affirmed, to, be, entirely, invisible, but, the, inadequacy, of, these, microscopes, for, the, observation, of, any, but, the, most, minute, bodies, and, even, of, those, if, parts, of, a, larger, body, destroys, their, utility, for, if, the, invention, could, be, extended, to, greater, bodies, or, the, minute, parts, of, greater, bodies, so, that, a, piece, of, cloth, would, appear, like, a, net, and, the, latent, minutiæ, and, irregularities, of, gems, liquids, urine, blood, wounds, and, many, other, things, could, be, rendered, visible, the, greatest, advantage, would, without, doubt, be, derived, we, have, an, instance, of, the, second, kind, in, the, telescope, discovered, by, the, wonderful, exertions, of, galileo, by, the, assistance, of, which, a, nearer, intercourse, may, be, opened, (as, by, boats, or, vessels), between, ourselves, and, the, heavenly, objects, for, by, its, aid, we, are, assured, that, the, milky, way, is, but, a, knot, or, constellation, of, small, stars, clearly, defined, and, separate, which, the, ancients, only, conjectured, to, be, the, case, whence, it, appears, to, be, capable, of, demonstration, that, the, spaces, of, the, planetary, orbits, (as, they, are, termed), are, not, quite, destitute, of, other, stars, but, that, the, heaven, begins, to, glitter, with, stars, before, we, arrive, at, the, starry, sphere, although, they, may, be, too, small, to, be, visible, without, the, telescope, by, the, telescope, also, we, can, behold, the, revolutions, of, smaller, stars, round, jupiter, whence, it, may, be, conjectured, that, there, are, several, centres, of, motion, among, the, stars, by, its, assistance, also, the, irregularity, of, light, and, shade, on, the, moon’s, surface, is, more, clearly, observed, and, determined, so, as, to, allow, of, a, sort, of, selenography, [136], by, the, telescope, we, see, the, spots, in, the, sun, and, other, similar, phenomena, all, of, which, are, most, noble, discoveries, as, far, as, credit, can, be, safely, given, to, demonstrations, of, this, nature, which, are, on, this, account, very, suspicious, namely, that, experiment, stops, at, these, few, and, nothing, further, has, yet, been, discovered, by, the, same, method, among, objects, equally, worthy, of, consideration, we, have, instances, of, the, third, kind, in, measuring-rods, astrolabes, and, the, like, which, do, not, enlarge, but, correct, and, guide, the, sight, if, there, be, other, instances, which, assist, the, other, senses, in, their, immediate, and, individual, action, yet, if, they, add, nothing, further, to, their, information, they, are, not, apposite, to, our, present, purpose, and, we, have, therefore, said, nothing, of, them, in, the, seventeenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, citing, instances, (to, borrow, a, term, from, the, tribunals), because, they, cite, those, things, to, appear, which, have, not, yet, appeared, we, are, wont, also, to, call, them, invoking, instances, and, their, property, is, that, of, reducing, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, objects, which, do, not, immediately, fall, within, it, objects, escape, the, senses, either, from, their, distance, or, the, intervention, of, other, bodies, or, because, they, are, not, calculated, to, make, an, impression, upon, the, senses, or, because, they, are, not, in, sufficient, quantity, to, strike, the, senses, or, because, there, is, not, sufficient, time, for, their, acting, upon, the, senses, or, because, the, impression, is, too, violent, or, because, the, senses, are, previously, filled, and, possessed, by, the, object, so, as, to, leave, no, room, for, any, new, motion, these, remarks, apply, principally, to, sight, and, next, to, touch, which, two, senses, act, extensively, in, giving, information, and, that, too, upon, general, objects, while, the, remaining, three, inform, us, only, as, it, were, by, their, immediate, action, and, as, to, specific, objects, there, can, be, no, reduction, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, in, the, first, case, unless, in, the, place, of, the, object, which, cannot, be, perceived, on, account, of, the, distance, there, be, added, or, substituted, some, other, object, which, can, excite, and, strike, the, sense, from, a, greater, distance, as, in, the, communication, of, intelligence, by, fires, bells, and, the, like, in, the, second, case, we, effect, this, reduction, by, rendering, those, things, which, are, concealed, by, the, interposition, of, other, bodies, and, which, cannot, easily, be, laid, open, evident, to, the, senses, by, means, of, that, which, lies, at, the, surface, or, proceeds, from, the, interior, thus, the, state, of, the, body, is, judged, of, by, the, pulse, urine, etc, the, third, and, fourth, cases, apply, to, many, subjects, and, the, reduction, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, must, be, obtained, from, every, quarter, in, the, investigation, of, things, there, are, many, examples, it, is, obvious, that, air, and, spirit, and, the, like, whose, whole, substance, is, extremely, rare, and, delicate, can, neither, be, seen, nor, touched--a, reduction, therefore, to, the, senses, becomes, necessary, in, every, investigation, relating, to, such, bodies, let, the, required, nature, therefore, be, the, action, and, motion, of, the, spirit, inclosed, in, tangible, bodies, for, every, tangible, body, with, which, we, are, acquainted, contains, an, invisible, and, intangible, spirit, over, which, it, is, drawn, and, which, it, seems, to, clothe, this, spirit, being, emitted, from, a, tangible, substance, leaves, the, body, contracted, and, dry, when, retained, it, softens, and, melts, it, when, neither, wholly, emitted, nor, retained, it, models, it, endows, it, with, limbs, assimilates, manifests, organizes, it, and, the, like, all, these, points, are, reduced, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, by, manifest, effects, for, in, every, tangible, and, inanimate, body, the, inclosed, spirit, at, first, increases, and, as, it, were, feeds, on, the, tangible, parts, which, are, most, open, and, prepared, for, it, and, when, it, has, digested, and, modified, them, and, turned, them, into, spirit, it, escapes, with, them, this, formation, and, increase, of, spirit, is, rendered, sensible, by, the, diminution, of, weight, for, in, every, desiccation, something, is, lost, in, quantity, not, only, of, the, spirit, previously, existing, in, the, body, but, of, the, body, itself, which, was, previously, tangible, and, has, been, recently, changed, for, the, spirit, itself, has, no, weight, the, departure, or, emission, of, spirit, is, rendered, sensible, in, the, rust, of, metals, and, other, putrefactions, of, a, like, nature, which, stop, before, they, arrive, at, the, rudiments, of, life, which, belong, to, the, third, species, of, process, [137], in, compact, bodies, the, spirit, does, not, find, pores, and, passages, for, its, escape, and, is, therefore, obliged, to, force, out, and, drive, before, it, the, tangible, parts, also, which, consequently, protrude, whence, arises, rust, and, the, like, the, contraction, of, the, tangible, parts, occasioned, by, the, emission, of, part, of, the, spirit, (whence, arises, desiccation), is, rendered, sensible, by, the, increased, hardness, of, the, substance, and, still, more, by, the, fissures, contractions, shrivelling, and, folds, of, the, bodies, thus, produced, for, the, parts, of, wood, split, and, contract, skins, become, shrivelled, and, not, only, that, but, if, the, spirit, be, emitted, suddenly, by, the, heat, of, the, fire, become, so, hastily, contracted, as, to, twist, and, roll, themselves, up, on, the, contrary, when, the, spirit, is, retained, and, yet, expanded, and, excited, by, heat, or, the, like, (which, happens, in, solid, and, tenacious, bodies), then, the, bodies, are, softened, as, in, hot, iron, or, flow, as, in, metals, or, melt, as, in, gums, wax, and, the, like, the, contrary, effects, of, heat, therefore, (hardening, some, substances, and, melting, others), are, easily, reconciled, [138], because, the, spirit, is, emitted, in, the, former, and, agitated, and, retained, in, the, latter, the, latter, action, is, that, of, heat, and, the, spirit, the, former, that, of, the, tangible, parts, themselves, after, the, spirit’s, emission, but, when, the, spirit, is, neither, entirely, retained, nor, emitted, but, only, strives, and, exercises, itself, within, its, limits, and, meets, with, tangible, parts, which, obey, and, readily, follow, it, wherever, it, leads, them, then, follows, the, formation, of, an, organic, body, and, of, limbs, and, the, other, vital, actions, of, vegetables, and, animals, these, are, rendered, sensible, chiefly, by, diligent, observation, of, the, first, beginnings, and, rudiments, or, effects, of, life, in, animalculæ, sprung, from, putrefaction, as, in, the, eggs, of, ants, worms, mosses, frogs, after, rain, etc, both, a, mild, heat, and, a, pliant, substance, however, are, necessary, for, the, production, of, life, in, order, that, the, spirit, may, neither, hastily, escape, nor, be, restrained, by, the, obstinacy, of, the, parts, so, as, not, to, be, able, to, bend, and, model, them, like, wax, again, the, difference, of, spirit, which, is, important, and, of, effect, in, many, points, (as, unconnected, spirit, branching, spirit, branching, and, cellular, spirit, the, first, of, which, is, that, of, all, inanimate, substances, the, second, of, vegetables, and, the, third, of, animals), is, placed, as, it, were, before, the, eyes, by, many, reducing, instances, again, it, is, clear, that, the, more, refined, tissue, and, conformation, of, things, (though, forming, the, whole, body, of, visible, or, tangible, objects), are, neither, visible, nor, tangible, our, information, therefore, must, here, also, be, derived, from, reduction, to, the, sphere, of, the, senses, but, the, most, radical, and, primary, difference, of, formation, depends, on, the, abundance, or, scarcity, of, matter, within, the, same, space, or, dimensions, for, the, other, formations, which, regard, the, dissimilarity, of, the, parts, contained, in, the, same, body, and, their, collocation, and, position, are, secondary, in, comparison, with, the, former, let, the, required, nature, then, be, the, expansion, or, coherence, of, matter, in, different, bodies, or, the, quantity, of, matter, relative, to, the, dimensions, of, each, for, there, is, nothing, in, nature, more, true, than, the, twofold, proposition--that, nothing, proceeds, from, nothing, and, that, nothing, is, reduced, to, nothing, but, that, the, quantum, or, sum, total, of, matter, is, constant, and, is, neither, increased, nor, diminished, nor, is, it, less, true, that, out, of, this, given, quantity, of, matter, there, is, a, greater, or, less, quantity, contained, within, the, same, space, or, dimensions, according, to, the, difference, of, bodies, as, for, instance, water, contains, more, than, air, so, that, if, any, one, were, to, assert, that, a, given, content, of, water, can, be, changed, into, an, equal, content, of, air, it, is, the, same, as, if, he, were, to, assert, that, something, can, be, reduced, into, nothing, on, the, contrary, if, any, one, were, to, assert, that, a, given, content, of, air, can, be, changed, into, an, equal, content, of, water, it, is, the, same, as, if, he, were, to, assert, that, something, can, proceed, from, nothing, from, this, abundance, or, scarcity, of, matter, are, properly, derived, the, notions, of, density, and, rarity, which, are, taken, in, various, and, promiscuous, senses, this, third, assertion, may, be, considered, as, being, also, sufficiently, certain, namely, that, the, greater, or, less, quantity, of, matter, in, this, or, that, body, may, by, comparison, be, reduced, to, calculation, and, exact, or, nearly, exact, proportion, thus, if, one, should, say, that, there, is, such, an, accumulation, of, matter, in, a, given, quantity, of, gold, that, it, would, require, twenty-one, times, the, quantity, in, dimension, of, spirits, of, wine, to, make, up, the, same, quantity, of, matter, it, would, not, be, far, from, the, truth, the, accumulation, of, matter, however, and, its, relative, quantity, are, rendered, sensible, by, weight, for, weight, is, proportionate, to, the, quantity, of, matter, as, regards, the, parts, of, a, tangible, substance, but, spirit, and, its, quantity, of, matter, are, not, to, be, computed, by, weight, which, spirit, rather, diminishes, than, augments, we, have, made, a, tolerably, accurate, table, of, weight, in, which, we, have, selected, the, weights, and, size, of, all, the, metals, the, principal, minerals, stones, liquids, oils, and, many, other, natural, and, artificial, bodies, a, very, useful, proceeding, both, as, regards, theory, and, practice, and, which, is, capable, of, revealing, many, unexpected, results, nor, is, this, of, little, consequence, that, it, serves, to, demonstrate, that, the, whole, range, of, the, variety, of, tangible, bodies, with, which, we, are, acquainted, (we, mean, tolerably, close, and, not, spongy, hollow, bodies, which, are, for, a, considerable, part, filled, with, air), does, not, exceed, the, ratio, of, one, to, twenty-one, so, limited, is, nature, or, at, least, that, part, of, it, to, which, we, are, most, habituated, we, have, also, thought, it, deserving, our, industry, to, try, if, we, could, arrive, at, the, ratio, of, intangible, or, pneumatic, bodies, to, tangible, bodies, which, we, attempted, by, the, following, contrivance, we, took, a, vial, capable, of, containing, about, an, ounce, using, a, small, vessel, in, order, to, effect, the, subsequent, evaporation, with, less, heat, we, filled, this, vial, almost, to, the, neck, with, spirits, of, wine, selecting, it, as, the, tangible, body, which, by, our, table, was, the, rarest, and, contained, a, less, quantity, of, matter, in, a, given, space, than, all, other, tangible, bodies, which, are, compact, and, not, hollow, then, we, noted, exactly, the, weight, of, the, liquid, and, vial, we, next, took, a, bladder, containing, about, two, pints, and, squeezed, all, the, air, out, of, it, as, completely, as, possible, and, until, the, sides, of, the, bladder, met, we, first, however, rubbed, the, bladder, gently, with, oil, so, as, to, make, it, air-tight, by, closing, its, pores, with, the, oil, we, tied, the, bladder, tightly, round, the, mouth, of, the, vial, which, we, had, inserted, in, it, and, with, a, piece, of, waxed, thread, to, make, it, fit, better, and, more, tightly, and, then, placed, the, vial, on, some, hot, coals, in, a, brazier, the, vapor, or, steam, of, the, spirit, dilated, and, become, aëriform, by, the, heat, gradually, swelled, out, the, bladder, and, stretched, it, in, every, direction, like, a, sail, as, soon, as, that, was, accomplished, we, removed, the, vial, from, the, fire, and, placed, it, on, a, carpet, that, it, might, not, be, cracked, by, the, cold, we, also, pricked, the, bladder, immediately, that, the, steam, might, not, return, to, a, liquid, state, by, the, cessation, of, heat, and, confound, the, proportions, we, then, removed, the, bladder, and, again, took, the, weight, of, the, spirit, which, remained, and, so, calculated, the, quantity, which, had, been, converted, into, vapor, or, an, aëriform, shape, and, then, examined, how, much, space, had, been, occupied, by, the, body, in, its, form, of, spirits, of, wine, in, the, vial, and, how, much, on, the, other, hand, had, been, occupied, by, it, in, its, aëriform, shape, in, the, bladder, and, subtracted, the, results, from, which, it, was, clear, that, the, body, thus, converted, and, changed, acquired, an, expansion, of, one, hundred, times, beyond, its, former, bulk, again, let, the, required, nature, be, heat, or, cold, of, such, a, degree, as, not, to, be, sensible, from, its, weakness, they, are, rendered, sensible, by, the, thermometer, as, we, described, it, above, [139], for, the, cold, and, heat, are, not, actually, perceived, by, the, touch, but, heat, expands, and, cold, contracts, the, air, nor, again, is, that, expansion, or, contraction, of, the, air, in, itself, visible, but, the, air, when, expanded, depresses, the, water, and, when, contracted, raises, it, which, is, the, first, reduction, to, sight, again, let, the, required, nature, be, the, mixture, of, bodies, namely, how, much, aqueous, oleaginous, or, spirituous, ashy, or, salt, parts, they, contain, or, as, a, particular, example, how, much, butter, cheese, and, whey, there, is, in, milk, and, the, like, these, things, are, rendered, sensible, by, artificial, and, skilful, separations, in, tangible, substances, and, the, nature, of, the, spirit, in, them, though, not, immediately, perceptible, is, nevertheless, discovered, by, the, various, motions, and, efforts, of, bodies, and, indeed, in, this, branch, men, have, labored, hard, in, distillations, and, artificial, separations, but, with, little, more, success, than, in, their, other, experiments, now, in, use, their, methods, being, mere, guesses, and, blind, attempts, and, more, industrious, than, intelligent, and, what, is, worst, of, all, without, any, imitation, or, rivalry, of, nature, but, rather, by, violent, heats, and, too, energetic, agents, to, the, destruction, of, any, delicate, conformation, in, which, principally, consist, the, hidden, virtues, and, sympathies, nor, do, men, in, these, separations, ever, attend, to, or, observe, what, we, have, before, pointed, out, namely, that, in, attacking, bodies, by, fire, or, other, methods, many, qualities, are, superinduced, by, the, fire, itself, and, the, other, bodies, used, to, effect, the, separation, which, were, not, originally, in, the, compound, hence, arise, most, extraordinary, fallacies, for, the, mass, of, vapor, which, is, emitted, from, water, by, fire, for, instance, did, not, exist, as, vapor, or, air, in, the, water, but, is, chiefly, created, by, the, expansion, of, the, water, by, the, heat, of, the, fire, so, in, general, all, delicate, experiments, on, natural, or, artificial, bodies, by, which, the, genuine, are, distinguished, from, the, adulterated, and, the, better, from, the, more, common, should, be, referred, to, this, division, for, they, bring, that, which, is, not, the, object, of, the, senses, within, their, sphere, they, are, therefore, to, be, everywhere, diligently, sought, after, with, regard, to, the, fifth, cause, of, objects, escaping, our, senses, it, is, clear, that, the, action, of, the, sense, takes, place, by, motion, and, this, motion, is, time, if, therefore, the, motion, of, any, body, be, either, so, slow, or, so, swift, as, not, to, be, proportioned, to, the, necessary, momentum, which, operates, on, the, senses, the, object, is, not, perceived, at, all, as, in, the, motion, of, the, hour, hand, and, that, again, of, a, musket-ball, the, motion, which, is, imperceptible, by, the, senses, from, its, slowness, is, readily, and, usually, rendered, sensible, by, the, accumulation, of, motion, that, which, is, imperceptible, from, its, velocity, has, not, as, yet, been, well, measured, it, is, necessary, however, that, this, should, be, done, in, some, cases, with, a, view, to, a, proper, investigation, of, nature, the, sixth, case, where, the, sense, is, impeded, by, the, power, of, the, object, admits, of, a, reduction, to, the, sensible, sphere, either, by, removing, the, object, to, a, greater, distance, or, by, deadening, its, effects, by, the, interposition, of, a, medium, which, may, weaken, and, not, destroy, the, object, or, by, the, admission, of, its, reflection, where, the, direct, impression, is, too, strong, as, that, of, the, sun, in, a, basin, of, water, the, seventh, case, where, the, senses, are, so, overcharged, with, the, object, as, to, leave, no, further, room, scarcely, occurs, except, in, the, smell, or, taste, and, is, not, of, much, consequence, as, regards, our, present, subject, let, what, we, have, said, therefore, suffice, with, regard, to, the, reduction, to, the, sensible, sphere, of, objects, not, naturally, within, its, compass, sometimes, however, this, reduction, is, not, extended, to, the, senses, of, man, but, to, those, of, some, other, animal, whose, senses, in, some, points, exceed, those, of, man, as, (with, regard, to, some, scents), to, that, of, the, dog, and, with, regard, to, light, existing, imperceptibly, in, the, air, when, not, illuminated, from, any, extraneous, source, to, the, sense, of, the, cat, the, owl, and, other, animals, which, see, by, night, for, telesius, has, well, observed, that, there, appears, to, be, an, original, portion, of, light, even, in, the, air, itself, [140], although, but, slight, and, meagre, and, of, no, use, for, the, most, part, to, the, eyes, of, men, and, those, of, the, generality, of, animals, because, those, animals, to, whose, senses, this, light, is, proportioned, can, see, by, night, which, does, not, in, all, probability, proceed, from, their, seeing, either, without, light, or, by, any, internal, light, here, too, we, would, observe, that, we, at, present, discuss, only, the, wants, of, the, senses, and, their, remedies, for, their, deceptions, must, be, referred, to, the, inquiries, appropriated, to, the, senses, and, sensible, objects, except, that, important, deception, which, makes, them, define, objects, in, their, relation, to, man, and, not, in, their, relation, to, the, universe, and, which, is, only, corrected, by, universal, reasoning, and, philosophy, [141], in, the, eighteenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, the, instances, of, the, road, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, itinerant, and, jointed, instances, they, are, such, as, indicate, the, gradually, continued, motions, of, nature, this, species, of, instances, escapes, rather, our, observation, than, our, senses, for, men, are, wonderfully, indolent, upon, this, subject, consulting, nature, in, a, desultory, manner, and, at, periodic, intervals, when, bodies, have, been, regularly, finished, and, completed, and, not, during, her, work, but, if, any, one, were, desirous, of, examining, and, contemplating, the, talents, and, industry, of, an, artificer, he, would, not, merely, wish, to, see, the, rude, materials, of, his, art, and, then, his, work, when, finished, but, rather, to, be, present, while, he, is, at, labor, and, proceeding, with, his, work, something, of, the, same, kind, should, be, done, with, regard, to, nature, for, instance, if, any, one, investigate, the, vegetation, of, plants, he, should, observe, from, the, first, sowing, of, any, seed, (which, can, easily, be, done, by, pulling, up, every, day, seeds, which, have, been, two, three, or, four, days, in, the, ground, and, examining, them, diligently), how, and, when, the, seed, begins, to, swell, and, break, and, be, filled, as, it, were, with, spirit, then, how, it, begins, to, burst, the, bark, and, push, out, fibres, raising, itself, a, little, at, the, same, time, unless, the, ground, be, very, stiff, then, how, it, pushes, out, these, fibres, some, downward, for, roots, others, upward, for, the, stem, sometimes, also, creeping, laterally, if, it, find, the, earth, open, and, more, yielding, on, one, side, and, the, like, the, same, should, be, done, in, observing, the, hatching, of, eggs, where, we, may, easily, see, the, process, of, animation, and, organization, and, what, parts, are, formed, of, the, yolk, and, what, of, the, white, of, the, egg, and, the, like, the, same, may, be, said, of, the, inquiry, into, the, formation, of, animals, from, putrefaction, for, it, would, not, be, so, humane, to, inquire, into, perfect, and, terrestrial, animals, by, cutting, the, fœtus, from, the, womb, but, opportunities, may, perhaps, be, offered, of, abortions, animals, killed, in, hunting, and, the, like, nature, therefore, must, as, it, were, be, watched, as, being, more, easily, observed, by, night, than, by, day, for, contemplations, of, this, kind, may, be, considered, as, carried, on, by, night, from, the, minuteness, and, perpetual, burning, of, our, watch-light, the, same, must, be, attempted, with, inanimate, objects, which, we, have, ourselves, done, by, inquiring, into, the, opening, of, liquids, by, fire, for, the, mode, in, which, water, expands, is, different, from, that, observed, in, wine, vinegar, or, verjuice, and, very, different, again, from, that, observed, in, milk, and, oil, and, the, like, and, this, was, easily, seen, by, boiling, them, with, slow, heat, in, a, glass, vessel, through, which, the, whole, may, be, clearly, perceived, but, we, merely, mention, this, intending, to, treat, of, it, more, at, large, and, more, closely, when, we, come, to, the, discovery, of, the, latent, process, for, it, should, always, be, remembered, that, we, do, not, here, treat, of, things, themselves, but, merely, propose, examples, [142], in, the, nineteenth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, class, supplementary, or, substitutive, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, instances, of, refuge, they, are, such, as, supply, information, where, the, senses, are, entirely, deficient, and, we, therefore, have, recourse, to, them, when, appropriate, instances, cannot, be, obtained, this, substitution, is, twofold, either, by, approximation, or, by, analogy, for, instance, there, is, no, known, medium, which, entirely, prevents, the, effect, of, the, magnet, in, attracting, iron--neither, gold, nor, silver, nor, stone, nor, glass, wood, water, oil, cloth, or, fibrous, bodies, air, flame, or, the, like, yet, by, accurate, experiment, a, medium, may, perhaps, be, found, which, would, deaden, its, effect, more, than, another, comparatively, and, in, degree, as, for, instance, the, magnet, would, not, perhaps, attract, iron, through, the, same, thickness, of, gold, as, of, air, or, the, same, quantity, of, ignited, as, of, cold, silver, and, so, on, for, we, have, not, ourselves, made, the, experiment, but, it, will, suffice, as, an, example, again, there, is, no, known, body, which, is, not, susceptible, of, heat, when, brought, near, the, fire, yet, air, becomes, warm, much, sooner, than, stone, these, are, examples, of, substitution, by, approximation, substitution, by, analogy, is, useful, but, less, sure, and, therefore, to, be, adopted, with, some, judgment, it, serves, to, reduce, that, which, is, not, the, object, of, the, senses, to, their, sphere, not, by, the, perceptible, operations, of, the, imperceptible, body, but, by, the, consideration, of, some, similar, perceptible, body, for, instance, let, the, subject, for, inquiry, be, the, mixture, of, spirits, which, are, invisible, bodies, there, appears, to, be, some, relation, between, bodies, and, their, sources, or, support, now, the, source, of, flame, seems, to, be, oil, and, fat, that, of, air, water, and, watery, substances, for, flame, increases, over, the, exhalation, of, oil, and, air, over, that, of, water, one, must, therefore, consider, the, mixture, of, oil, and, water, which, is, manifest, to, the, senses, since, that, of, air, and, flame, in, general, escapes, the, senses, but, oil, and, water, mix, very, imperfectly, by, composition, or, stirring, while, they, are, exactly, and, nicely, mixed, in, herbs, blood, and, the, parts, of, animals, something, similar, therefore, may, take, place, in, the, mixture, of, flame, and, air, in, spirituous, substances, not, bearing, mixture, very, well, by, simple, collision, while, they, appear, however, to, be, well, mixed, in, the, spirits, of, plants, and, animals, again, if, the, inquiry, do, not, relate, to, perfect, mixtures, of, spirits, but, merely, to, their, composition, as, whether, they, easily, incorporate, with, each, other, or, there, be, rather, (as, an, example), certain, winds, and, exhalations, or, other, spiritual, bodies, which, do, not, mix, with, common, air, but, only, adhere, to, and, float, in, it, in, globules, and, drops, and, are, rather, broken, and, pounded, by, the, air, than, received, into, and, incorporated, with, it, this, cannot, be, perceived, in, common, air, and, other, aëriform, substances, on, account, of, the, rarity, of, the, bodies, but, an, image, as, it, were, of, this, process, may, be, conceived, in, such, liquids, as, quicksilver, oil, water, and, even, air, when, broken, and, dissipated, it, ascends, in, small, portions, through, water, and, also, in, the, thicker, kinds, of, smoke, lastly, in, dust, raised, and, remaining, in, the, air, in, all, of, which, there, is, no, incorporation, and, the, above, representation, in, this, respect, is, not, a, bad, one, if, it, be, first, diligently, investigated, whether, there, can, be, such, a, difference, of, nature, between, spirituous, substances, as, between, liquids, for, then, these, images, might, conveniently, be, substituted, by, analogy, and, although, we, have, observed, of, these, supplementary, instances, that, information, is, to, be, derived, from, them, when, appropriate, instances, are, wanting, by, way, of, refuge, yet, we, would, have, it, understood, that, they, are, also, of, great, use, when, the, appropriate, instances, are, at, hand, in, order, to, confirm, the, information, afforded, by, them, of, which, we, will, speak, more, at, length, when, our, subject, leads, us, in, due, course, to, the, support, of, induction, in, the, twentieth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, lancing, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, (but, for, a, different, reason), to, call, twitching, instances, we, adopt, the, latter, name, because, they, twitch, the, understanding, and, the, former, because, they, pierce, nature, whence, we, style, them, occasionally, the, instances, of, democritus, [143], they, are, such, as, warn, the, understanding, of, the, admirable, and, exquisite, subtilty, of, nature, so, that, it, becomes, roused, and, awakened, to, attention, observation, and, proper, inquiry, as, for, instance, that, a, little, drop, of, ink, should, be, drawn, out, into, so, many, letters, that, silver, merely, gilt, on, its, surface, should, be, stretched, to, such, a, length, of, gilt, wire, that, a, little, worm, such, as, you, may, find, on, the, skin, should, possess, both, a, spirit, and, a, varied, conformation, of, its, parts, that, a, little, saffron, should, imbue, a, whole, tub, of, water, with, its, color, that, a, little, musk, or, aroma, should, imbue, a, much, greater, extent, of, air, with, its, perfume, that, a, cloud, of, smoke, should, be, raised, by, a, little, incense, that, such, accurate, differences, of, sounds, as, articulate, words, should, be, conveyed, in, all, directions, through, the, air, and, even, penetrate, the, pores, of, wood, and, water, (though, they, become, much, weakened), that, they, should, be, moreover, reflected, and, that, with, such, distinctness, and, velocity, that, light, and, color, should, for, such, an, extent, and, so, rapidly, pass, through, solid, bodies, such, as, glass, and, water, with, so, great, and, so, exquisite, a, variety, of, images, and, should, be, refracted, and, reflected, that, the, magnet, should, attract, through, every, description, of, body, even, the, most, compact, but, (what, is, still, more, wonderful), that, in, all, these, cases, the, action, of, one, should, not, impede, that, of, another, in, a, common, medium, such, as, air, and, that, there, should, be, borne, through, the, air, at, the, same, time, so, many, images, of, visible, objects, so, many, impulses, of, articulation, so, many, different, perfumes, as, of, the, violet, rose, etc, besides, cold, and, heat, and, magnetic, attractions, all, of, them, say, at, once, without, any, impediment, from, each, other, as, if, each, had, its, paths, and, peculiar, passage, set, apart, for, it, without, infringing, against, or, meeting, each, other, to, these, lancing, instances, however, we, are, wont, not, without, some, advantage, to, add, those, which, we, call, the, limits, of, such, instances, thus, in, the, cases, we, have, pointed, out, one, action, does, not, disturb, or, impede, another, of, a, different, nature, yet, those, of, a, similar, nature, subdue, and, extinguish, each, other, as, the, light, of, the, sun, does, that, of, the, candle, the, sound, of, a, cannon, that, of, the, voice, a, strong, perfume, a, more, delicate, one, a, powerful, heat, a, more, gentle, one, a, plate, of, iron, between, the, magnet, and, other, iron, the, effect, of, the, magnet, but, the, proper, place, for, mentioning, these, will, be, also, among, the, supports, of, induction, we, have, now, spoken, of, the, instances, which, assist, the, senses, and, which, are, principally, of, service, as, regards, information, for, information, begins, from, the, senses, but, our, whole, labor, terminates, in, practice, and, as, the, former, is, the, beginning, so, is, the, latter, the, end, of, our, subject, the, following, instances, therefore, will, be, those, which, are, chiefly, useful, in, practice, they, are, comprehended, in, two, classes, and, are, seven, in, number, we, call, them, all, by, the, general, name, of, practical, instances, now, there, are, two, defects, in, practice, and, as, many, divisions, of, important, instances, practice, is, either, deceptive, or, too, laborious, it, is, generally, deceptive, (especially, after, a, diligent, examination, of, natures), on, account, of, the, power, and, actions, of, bodies, being, ill, defined, and, determined, now, the, powers, and, actions, of, bodies, are, defined, and, determined, either, by, space, or, by, time, or, by, the, quantity, at, a, given, period, or, by, the, predominance, of, energy, and, if, these, four, circumstances, be, not, well, and, diligently, considered, the, sciences, may, indeed, be, beautiful, in, theory, but, are, of, no, effect, in, practice, we, call, the, four, instances, referred, to, this, class, mathematical, instances, and, instances, of, measure, practice, is, laborious, either, from, the, multitude, of, instruments, or, the, bulk, of, matter, and, substances, requisite, for, any, given, work, those, instances, therefore, are, valuable, which, either, direct, practice, to, that, which, is, of, most, consequence, to, mankind, or, lessen, the, number, of, instruments, or, of, matter, to, be, worked, upon, we, assign, to, the, three, instances, relating, to, this, class, the, common, name, of, propitious, or, benevolent, instances, we, will, now, separately, discuss, these, seven, instances, and, conclude, with, them, that, part, of, our, work, which, relates, to, the, prerogative, or, illustrious, instances, in, the, twenty-first, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, instances, of, the, rod, or, rule, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, the, instances, of, completion, or, _non, ultrà_, for, the, powers, and, motions, of, bodies, do, not, act, and, take, effect, through, indefinite, and, accidental, but, through, limited, and, certain, spaces, and, it, is, of, great, importance, to, practice, that, these, should, be, understood, and, noted, in, every, nature, which, is, investigated, not, only, to, prevent, deception, but, to, render, practice, more, extensive, and, efficient, for, it, is, sometimes, possible, to, extend, these, powers, and, bring, the, distance, as, it, were, nearer, as, in, the, example, of, telescopes, many, powers, act, and, take, effect, only, by, actual, touch, as, in, the, percussion, of, bodies, where, the, one, does, not, remove, the, other, unless, the, impelling, touch, the, impelled, body, external, applications, in, medicine, as, ointment, and, plasters, do, not, exercise, their, efficacy, except, when, in, contact, with, the, body, lastly, the, objects, of, touch, and, taste, only, strike, those, senses, when, in, contact, with, their, organs, other, powers, act, at, a, distance, though, it, be, very, small, of, which, but, few, have, as, yet, been, noted, although, there, be, more, than, men, suspect, this, happens, (to, take, everyday, instances), when, amber, or, jet, attracts, straws, bubbles, dissolve, bubbles, some, purgative, medicines, draw, humors, from, above, and, the, like, the, magnetic, power, by, which, iron, and, the, magnet, or, two, magnets, are, attracted, together, acts, within, a, definite, and, narrow, sphere, but, if, there, be, any, magnetic, power, emanating, from, the, earth, a, little, below, its, surface, and, affecting, the, needle, in, its, polarity, it, must, act, at, a, great, distance, again, if, there, be, any, magnetic, force, which, acts, by, sympathy, between, the, globe, of, the, earth, and, heavy, bodies, or, between, that, of, the, moon, and, the, waters, of, the, sea, (as, seems, most, probable, from, the, particular, floods, and, ebbs, which, occur, twice, in, the, month), or, between, the, starry, sphere, and, the, planets, by, which, they, are, summoned, and, raised, to, their, apogees, these, must, all, operate, at, very, great, distances, [144], again, some, conflagrations, and, the, kindling, of, flames, take, place, at, very, considerable, distances, with, particular, substances, as, they, report, of, the, naphtha, of, babylon, heat, too, insinuates, itself, at, wide, distances, as, does, also, cold, so, that, the, masses, of, ice, which, are, broken, off, and, float, upon, the, northern, ocean, and, are, borne, through, the, atlantic, to, the, coast, of, canada, become, perceptible, by, the, inhabitants, and, strike, them, with, cold, from, a, distance, perfumes, also, (though, here, there, appears, to, be, always, some, corporeal, emission), act, at, remarkable, distances, as, is, experienced, by, persons, sailing, by, the, coast, of, florida, or, parts, of, spain, where, there, are, whole, woods, of, lemons, oranges, and, other, odoriferous, plants, or, rosemary, and, marjoram, bushes, and, the, like, lastly, the, rays, of, light, and, the, impressions, of, sound, act, at, extensive, distances, yet, all, these, powers, whether, acting, at, a, small, or, great, distance, certainly, act, within, definite, distances, which, are, well, ascertained, by, nature, so, that, there, is, a, limit, depending, either, on, the, mass, or, quantity, of, the, bodies, the, vigor, or, faintness, of, the, powers, or, the, favorable, or, impeding, nature, of, the, medium, all, of, which, should, be, taken, into, account, and, observed, we, must, also, note, the, boundaries, of, violent, motions, such, as, missiles, projectiles, wheels, and, the, like, since, they, are, also, manifestly, confined, to, certain, limits, some, motions, and, virtues, are, to, be, found, of, a, directly, contrary, nature, to, these, which, act, in, contact, but, not, at, a, distance, namely, such, as, operate, at, a, distance, and, not, in, contact, and, again, act, with, less, force, at, a, less, distance, and, the, reverse, sight, for, instance, is, not, easily, effective, in, contact, but, requires, a, medium, and, distance, although, remember, having, heard, from, a, person, deserving, of, credit, that, in, being, cured, of, a, cataract, (which, was, done, by, putting, a, small, silver, needle, within, the, first, coat, of, the, eye, to, remove, the, thin, pellicle, of, the, cataract, and, force, it, into, a, corner, of, the, eye), he, had, distinctly, seen, the, needle, moving, across, the, pupil, still, though, this, may, be, true, it, is, clear, that, large, bodies, cannot, be, seen, well, or, distinctly, unless, at, the, vertex, of, a, cone, where, the, rays, from, the, object, meet, at, some, distance, from, the, eye, in, old, persons, the, eye, sees, better, if, the, object, be, moved, a, little, further, and, not, nearer, again, it, is, certain, that, in, projectiles, the, impact, is, not, so, violent, at, too, short, a, distance, as, a, little, afterward, [145], such, are, the, observations, to, be, made, on, the, measure, of, motions, as, regards, distance, there, is, another, measure, of, motion, in, space, which, must, not, be, passed, over, not, relating, to, progressive, but, spherical, motion--that, is, the, expansion, of, bodies, into, a, greater, or, their, contraction, into, a, lesser, sphere, for, in, our, measure, of, this, motion, we, must, inquire, what, degree, of, compression, or, extension, bodies, easily, and, readily, admit, of, according, to, their, nature, and, at, what, point, they, begin, to, resist, it, so, as, at, last, to, bear, it, no, further--as, when, an, inflated, bladder, is, compressed, it, allows, a, certain, compression, of, the, air, but, if, this, be, increased, the, air, does, not, suffer, it, and, the, bladder, is, burst, we, have, proved, this, by, a, more, delicate, experiment, we, took, a, metal, bell, of, a, light, and, thin, sort, such, as, is, used, for, salt-cellars, and, immersed, it, in, a, basin, of, water, so, as, to, carry, the, air, contained, in, its, interior, down, with, it, to, the, bottom, of, the, basin, we, had, first, however, placed, a, small, globe, at, the, bottom, of, the, basin, over, which, we, placed, the, bell, the, result, was, that, if, the, globe, were, small, compared, with, the, interior, of, the, bell, the, air, would, contract, itself, and, be, compressed, without, being, forced, out, but, if, it, were, too, large, for, the, air, readily, to, yield, to, it, the, latter, became, impatient, of, the, pressure, raised, the, bell, partly, up, and, ascended, in, bubbles, to, prove, also, the, extension, (as, well, as, the, compression), which, air, admits, of, we, adopted, the, following, method, --we, took, a, glass, egg, with, a, small, hole, at, one, end, we, drew, out, the, air, by, violent, suction, at, this, hole, and, then, closed, the, hole, with, the, finger, immersed, the, egg, in, water, and, then, removed, the, finger, the, air, being, constrained, by, the, effort, made, in, suction, and, dilated, beyond, its, natural, state, and, therefore, striving, to, recover, and, contract, itself, (so, that, if, the, egg, had, not, been, immersed, in, water, it, would, have, drawn, in, the, air, with, a, hissing, sound), now, drew, in, a, sufficient, quantity, of, water, to, allow, the, air, to, recover, its, former, dimensions, [146], it, is, well, ascertained, that, rare, bodies, (such, as, air), admit, of, considerable, contraction, as, has, been, before, observed, but, tangible, bodies, (such, as, water), admit, of, it, much, less, readily, and, to, a, less, extent, we, investigated, the, latter, point, by, the, following, experiment, we, had, a, leaden, globe, made, capable, of, containing, about, two, pints, wine, measure, and, of, tolerable, thickness, so, as, to, support, considerable, pressure, we, poured, water, into, it, through, an, aperture, which, we, afterward, closed, with, melted, lead, as, soon, as, the, globe, was, filled, with, water, so, that, the, whole, became, perfectly, solid, we, next, flattened, the, two, opposite, sides, with, a, heavy, hammer, which, necessarily, caused, the, water, to, occupy, a, less, space, since, the, sphere, is, the, solid, of, greatest, content, and, when, hammering, failed, from, the, resistance, of, the, water, we, made, use, of, a, mill, or, press, till, at, last, the, water, refusing, to, submit, to, a, greater, pressure, exuded, like, a, fine, dew, through, the, solid, lead, we, then, computed, the, extent, to, which, the, original, space, had, been, reduced, and, concluded, that, water, admitted, such, a, degree, of, compression, when, constrained, by, great, violence, the, more, solid, dry, or, compact, bodies, such, as, stones, wood, and, metals, admit, of, much, less, and, indeed, scarcely, any, perceptible, compression, or, expansion, but, escape, by, breaking, slipping, forward, or, other, efforts, as, appears, in, bending, wood, or, steel, for, watch-springs, in, projectiles, hammering, and, many, other, motions, all, of, which, together, with, their, degrees, are, to, be, observed, and, examined, in, the, investigation, of, nature, either, to, a, certainty, or, by, estimation, or, comparison, as, opportunity, permits, in, the, twenty-second, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, instances, of, the, course, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, water, instances, borrowing, our, expression, from, the, water, hour-glasses, employed, by, the, ancients, instead, of, those, with, sand, they, are, such, as, measure, nature, by, the, moments, of, time, as, the, last, instances, do, by, the, degrees, of, space, for, all, motion, or, natural, action, takes, place, in, time, more, or, less, rapidly, but, still, in, determined, moments, well, ascertained, by, nature, even, those, actions, which, appear, to, take, effect, suddenly, and, in, the, twinkling, of, an, eye, (as, we, express, it), are, found, to, admit, of, greater, or, less, rapidity, in, the, first, place, then, we, see, that, the, return, of, the, heavenly, bodies, to, the, same, place, takes, place, in, regular, times, as, does, the, flood, and, ebb, of, the, sea, the, descent, of, heavy, bodies, toward, the, earth, and, the, ascent, of, light, bodies, toward, the, heavenly, sphere, take, place, in, definite, times, [147], according, to, the, nature, of, the, body, and, of, the, medium, through, which, it, moves, the, sailing, of, ships, the, motions, of, animals, the, transmission, of, projectiles, all, take, place, in, times, the, sums, of, which, can, be, computed, with, regard, to, heat, we, see, that, boys, in, winter, bathe, their, hands, in, the, flame, without, being, burned, and, conjurers, by, quick, and, regular, movements, overturn, vessels, filled, with, wine, or, water, and, replace, them, without, spilling, the, liquid, with, several, similar, instances, the, compression, expansion, and, eruption, of, several, bodies, take, place, more, or, less, rapidly, according, to, the, nature, of, the, body, and, its, motion, but, still, in, definite, moments, in, the, explosion, of, several, cannon, at, once, (which, are, sometimes, heard, at, the, distance, of, thirty, miles), the, sound, of, those, nearest, to, the, spot, is, heard, before, that, of, the, most, distant, even, in, sight, (whose, action, is, most, rapid), it, is, clear, that, a, definite, time, is, necessary, for, its, exertion, which, is, proved, by, certain, objects, being, invisible, from, the, velocity, of, their, motion, such, as, a, musket-ball, for, the, flight, of, the, ball, is, too, swift, to, allow, an, impression, of, its, figure, to, be, conveyed, to, the, sight, this, last, instance, and, others, of, a, like, nature, have, sometimes, excited, in, us, a, most, marvellous, doubt, no, less, than, whether, the, image, of, the, sky, and, stars, is, perceived, as, at, the, actual, moment, of, its, existence, or, rather, a, little, after, and, whether, there, is, not, (with, regard, to, the, visible, appearance, of, the, heavenly, bodies), a, true, and, apparent, time, as, well, as, a, true, and, apparent, place, which, is, observed, by, astronomers, in, parallaxes, it, appeared, so, incredible, to, us, that, the, images, or, radiations, of, heavenly, bodies, could, suddenly, be, conveyed, through, such, immense, spaces, to, the, sight, and, it, seemed, that, they, ought, rather, to, be, transmitted, in, a, definite, time, [148], that, doubt, however, (as, far, as, regards, any, great, difference, between, the, true, and, apparent, time), was, subsequently, completely, set, at, rest, when, we, considered, the, infinite, loss, and, diminution, of, size, as, regards, the, real, and, apparent, magnitude, of, a, star, occasioned, by, its, distance, and, at, the, same, time, observed, at, how, great, a, distance, (at, least, sixty, miles), bodies, which, are, merely, white, can, be, suddenly, seen, by, us, for, there, is, no, doubt, that, the, light, of, the, heavenly, bodies, not, only, far, surpasses, the, vivid, appearance, of, white, but, even, the, light, of, any, flame, (with, which, we, are, acquainted), in, the, vigor, of, its, radiation, the, immense, velocity, of, the, bodies, themselves, which, is, perceived, in, their, diurnal, motion, and, has, so, astonished, thinking, men, that, they, have, been, more, ready, to, believe, in, the, motion, of, the, earth, renders, the, motion, of, radiation, from, them, (marvellous, as, it, is, in, its, rapidity), more, worthy, of, belief, that, which, has, weighed, most, with, us, however, is, that, if, there, were, any, considerable, interval, of, time, between, the, reality, and, the, appearance, the, images, would, often, be, interrupted, and, confused, by, clouds, formed, in, the, meantime, and, similar, disturbances, of, the, medium, let, this, suffice, with, regard, to, the, simple, measures, of, time, it, is, not, merely, the, absolute, but, still, more, the, relative, measure, of, motions, and, actions, which, must, be, inquired, into, for, this, latter, is, of, great, use, and, application, we, perceive, that, the, flame, of, firearms, is, seen, sooner, than, the, sound, is, heard, although, the, ball, must, have, struck, the, air, before, the, flame, which, was, behind, it, could, escape, the, reason, of, which, is, that, light, moves, with, greater, velocity, than, sound, we, perceive, also, that, visible, images, are, received, by, the, sight, with, greater, rapidity, than, they, are, dismissed, and, for, this, reason, a, violin, string, touched, with, the, finger, appears, double, or, triple, because, the, new, image, is, received, before, the, former, one, is, dismissed, hence, also, rings, when, spinning, appear, globular, and, a, lighted, torch, borne, rapidly, along, at, night, appears, to, have, a, tail, upon, the, principle, of, the, inequality, of, motion, also, galileo, attempted, an, explanation, of, the, flood, and, ebb, of, the, sea, supposing, the, earth, to, move, rapidly, and, the, water, slowly, by, which, means, the, water, after, accumulating, would, at, intervals, fall, back, as, is, shown, in, a, vessel, of, water, made, to, move, rapidly, he, has, however, imagined, this, on, data, which, cannot, be, granted, (namely, the, earth’s, motion), and, besides, does, not, satisfactorily, account, for, the, tide, taking, place, every, six, hours, an, example, of, our, present, point, (the, relative, measure, of, motion), and, at, the, same, time, of, its, remarkable, use, of, which, we, have, spoken, is, conspicuous, in, mines, filled, with, gunpowder, where, immense, weights, of, earth, buildings, and, the, like, are, overthrown, and, prostrated, by, a, small, quantity, of, powder, the, reason, of, which, is, decidedly, this, that, the, motion, of, the, expansion, of, the, gunpowder, is, much, more, rapid, than, that, of, gravity, [149], which, would, resist, it, so, that, the, former, has, terminated, before, the, latter, has, commenced, hence, also, in, missiles, a, strong, blow, will, not, carry, them, so, far, as, a, sharp, and, rapid, one, nor, could, a, small, portion, of, animal, spirit, in, animals, especially, in, such, vast, bodies, as, those, of, the, whale, and, elephant, have, ever, bent, or, directed, such, a, mass, of, body, were, it, not, owing, to, the, velocity, of, the, former, and, the, slowness, of, the, latter, in, resisting, its, motion, in, short, this, point, is, one, of, the, principal, foundations, of, the, magic, experiments, (of, which, we, shall, presently, speak), where, a, small, mass, of, matter, overcomes, and, regulates, a, much, larger, if, there, but, be, an, anticipation, of, motion, by, the, velocity, of, one, before, the, other, is, prepared, to, act, finally, the, point, of, the, first, and, last, should, be, observed, in, all, natural, actions, thus, in, an, infusion, of, rhubarb, the, purgative, property, is, first, extracted, and, then, the, astringent, we, have, experienced, something, of, the, same, kind, in, steeping, violets, in, vinegar, which, first, extracts, the, sweet, and, delicate, odor, of, the, flower, and, then, the, more, earthy, part, which, disturbs, the, perfume, so, that, if, the, violets, be, steeped, a, whole, day, a, much, fainter, perfume, is, extracted, than, if, they, were, steeped, for, a, quarter, of, an, hour, only, and, then, taken, out, and, since, the, odoriferous, spirit, in, the, violet, is, not, abundant, let, other, and, fresh, violets, be, steeped, in, the, vinegar, every, quarter, of, an, hour, as, many, as, six, times, when, the, infusion, becomes, so, strengthened, that, although, the, violets, have, not, altogether, remained, there, for, more, than, one, hour, and, a, half, there, remains, a, most, pleasing, perfume, not, inferior, to, the, flower, itself, for, a, whole, year, it, must, be, observed, however, that, the, perfume, does, not, acquire, its, full, strength, till, about, a, month, after, the, infusion, in, the, distillation, of, aromatic, plants, macerated, in, spirits, of, wine, it, is, well, known, that, an, aqueous, and, useless, phlegm, rises, first, then, water, containing, more, of, the, spirit, and, lastly, water, containing, more, of, the, aroma, and, many, observations, of, the, like, kind, well, worthy, of, notice, are, to, be, made, in, distillations, but, let, these, suffice, as, examples, [150], in, the, twenty-third, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, instances, of, quantity, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, the, doses, of, nature, (borrowing, a, word, from, medicine), they, are, such, as, measure, the, powers, by, the, quantity, of, bodies, and, point, out, the, effect, of, the, quantity, in, the, degree, of, power, and, in, the, first, place, some, powers, only, subsist, in, the, universal, quantity, or, such, as, bears, a, relation, to, the, confirmation, and, fabric, of, the, universe, thus, the, earth, is, fixed, its, parts, fall, the, waters, in, the, sea, flow, and, ebb, but, not, in, the, rivers, except, by, the, admission, of, the, sea, then, again, almost, all, particular, powers, act, according, to, the, greater, or, less, quantity, of, the, body, large, masses, of, water, are, not, easily, rendered, foul, small, are, new, wine, and, beer, become, ripe, and, drinkable, in, small, skins, much, more, readily, than, in, large, casks, if, a, herb, be, placed, in, a, considerable, quantity, of, liquid, infusion, takes, place, rather, than, impregnation, if, in, less, the, reverse, bath, therefore, and, a, light, sprinkling, produce, different, effects, on, the, human, body, light, dew, again, never, falls, but, is, dissipated, and, incorporated, with, the, air, thus, we, see, that, in, breathing, on, gems, the, slight, quantity, of, moisture, like, a, small, cloud, in, the, air, is, immediately, dissolved, again, a, piece, of, the, same, magnet, does, not, attract, so, much, iron, as, the, whole, magnet, did, there, are, some, powers, where, the, smallness, of, the, quantity, is, of, more, avail, as, in, boring, a, sharp, point, pierces, more, readily, than, a, blunt, one, the, diamond, when, pointed, makes, an, impression, on, glass, and, the, like, here, too, we, must, not, rest, contented, with, a, vague, result, but, inquire, into, the, exact, proportion, of, quantity, requisite, for, a, particular, exertion, of, power, for, one, would, be, apt, to, suppose, that, the, power, bears, an, exact, proportion, to, the, quantity, that, if, a, leaden, bullet, of, one, ounce, for, instance, would, fall, in, a, given, time, one, of, two, ounces, ought, to, fall, twice, as, rapidly, which, is, most, erroneous, nor, does, the, same, ratio, prevail, in, every, kind, of, power, their, difference, being, considerable, the, measure, therefore, must, be, determined, by, experiment, and, not, by, probability, or, conjecture, lastly, we, must, in, all, our, investigations, of, nature, observe, what, quantity, or, dose, of, the, body, is, requisite, for, a, given, effect, and, must, at, the, same, time, be, guarded, against, estimating, it, at, too, much, or, too, little, in, the, twenty-fourth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, wrestling, instances, which, we, are, also, wont, to, call, instances, of, predominance, they, are, such, as, point, out, the, predominance, and, submission, of, powers, compared, with, each, other, and, which, of, them, is, the, more, energetic, and, superior, or, more, weak, and, inferior, for, the, motions, and, effects, of, bodies, are, compounded, decomposed, and, combined, no, less, than, the, bodies, themselves, we, will, exhibit, therefore, the, principal, kinds, of, motions, or, active, powers, in, order, that, their, comparative, strength, and, thence, a, demonstration, and, definition, of, the, instances, in, question, may, be, rendered, more, clear, let, the, first, motion, be, that, of, the, resistance, of, matter, which, exists, in, every, particle, and, completely, prevents, its, annihilation, so, that, no, conflagration, weight, pressure, violence, or, length, of, time, can, reduce, even, the, smallest, portion, of, matter, to, nothing, or, prevent, it, from, being, something, and, occupying, some, space, and, delivering, itself, (whatever, straits, it, be, put, to), by, changing, its, form, or, place, or, if, that, be, impossible, remaining, as, it, is, nor, can, it, ever, happen, that, it, should, either, be, nothing, or, nowhere, this, motion, is, designated, by, the, schools, (which, generally, name, and, define, everything, by, its, effects, and, inconveniences, rather, than, by, its, inherent, cause), by, the, axiom, that, two, bodies, cannot, exist, in, the, same, place, or, they, call, it, a, motion, to, prevent, the, penetration, of, dimensions, it, is, useless, to, give, examples, of, this, motion, since, it, exists, in, every, body, let, the, second, motion, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, connection, by, which, bodies, do, not, allow, themselves, to, be, separated, at, any, point, from, the, contact, of, another, body, delighting, as, it, were, in, the, mutual, connection, and, contact, this, is, called, by, the, schools, a, motion, to, prevent, a, vacuum, it, takes, place, when, water, is, drawn, up, by, suction, or, a, syringe, the, flesh, by, cupping, or, when, the, water, remains, without, escaping, from, perforated, jars, unless, the, mouth, be, opened, to, admit, the, air, and, innumerable, instances, of, a, like, nature, let, the, third, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, liberty, by, which, bodies, strive, to, deliver, themselves, from, any, unnatural, pressure, or, tension, and, to, restore, themselves, to, the, dimensions, suited, to, their, mass, and, of, which, also, there, are, innumerable, examples, thus, we, have, examples, of, their, escaping, from, pressure, in, the, water, in, swimming, in, the, air, in, flying, in, the, water, again, in, rowing, and, in, the, air, in, the, undulation, of, the, winds, and, in, springs, of, watches, an, exact, instance, of, the, motion, of, compressed, air, is, seen, in, children’s, popguns, which, they, make, by, scooping, out, elder-branches, or, some, such, matter, and, forcing, in, a, piece, of, some, pulpy, root, or, the, like, at, each, end, then, they, force, the, root, or, other, pellet, with, a, ramrod, to, the, opposite, end, from, which, the, lower, pellet, is, emitted, and, projected, with, a, report, and, that, before, it, is, touched, by, the, other, piece, of, root, or, pellet, or, by, the, ramrod, we, have, examples, of, their, escape, from, tension, in, the, motion, of, the, air, that, remains, in, glass, eggs, after, suction, in, strings, leather, and, cloth, which, recoil, after, tension, unless, it, be, long, continued, the, schools, define, this, by, the, term, of, motion, from, the, form, of, the, element, injudiciously, enough, since, this, motion, is, to, be, found, not, only, in, air, water, or, fire, but, in, every, species, of, solid, as, wood, iron, lead, cloth, parchment, etc, each, of, which, has, its, own, proper, size, and, is, with, difficulty, stretched, to, any, other, since, however, this, motion, of, liberty, is, the, most, obvious, of, all, and, to, be, seen, in, an, infinite, number, of, cases, it, will, be, as, well, to, distinguish, it, correctly, and, clearly, for, some, most, carelessly, confound, this, with, the, two, others, of, resistance, and, connection, namely, the, freedom, from, pressure, with, the, former, and, that, from, tension, with, the, latter, as, if, bodies, when, compressed, yielded, or, expanded, to, prevent, a, penetration, of, dimensions, and, when, stretched, rebounded, and, contracted, themselves, to, prevent, a, vacuum, but, if, the, air, when, compressed, could, be, brought, to, the, density, of, water, or, wood, to, that, of, stone, there, would, be, no, need, of, any, penetration, of, dimensions, and, yet, the, compression, would, be, much, greater, than, they, actually, admit, of, so, if, water, could, be, expanded, till, it, became, as, rare, as, air, or, stone, as, rare, as, wood, there, would, be, no, need, of, a, vacuum, and, yet, the, expansion, would, be, much, greater, than, they, actually, admit, of, we, do, not, therefore, arrive, at, a, penetration, of, dimensions, or, a, vacuum, before, the, extremes, of, condensation, and, rarefaction, while, the, motion, we, speak, of, stops, and, exerts, itself, much, within, them, and, is, nothing, more, than, a, desire, of, bodies, to, preserve, their, specific, density, (or, if, it, be, preferred, their, form), and, not, to, desert, them, suddenly, but, only, to, change, by, degrees, and, of, their, own, accord, it, is, however, much, more, necessary, to, intimate, to, mankind, (because, many, other, points, depend, upon, this), that, the, violent, motion, which, we, call, mechanical, and, democritus, (who, in, explaining, his, primary, motions, is, to, be, ranked, even, below, the, middling, class, of, philosophers), termed, the, motion, of, a, blow, is, nothing, else, than, this, motion, of, liberty, namely, a, tendency, to, relaxation, from, compression, for, in, all, simple, impulsion, or, flight, through, the, air, the, body, is, not, displaced, or, moved, in, space, until, its, parts, are, placed, in, an, unnatural, state, and, compressed, by, the, impelling, force, when, that, takes, place, the, different, parts, urging, the, other, in, succession, the, whole, is, moved, and, that, with, a, rotatory, as, well, as, progressive, motion, in, order, that, the, parts, may, by, this, means, also, set, themselves, at, liberty, or, more, readily, submit, let, this, suffice, for, the, motion, in, question, let, the, fourth, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, matter, and, which, is, opposed, to, the, last, for, in, the, motion, of, liberty, bodies, abhor, reject, and, avoid, a, new, size, or, volume, or, any, new, expansion, or, contraction, (for, these, different, terms, have, the, same, meaning), and, strive, with, all, their, power, to, rebound, and, resume, their, former, density, on, the, contrary, in, the, motion, of, matter, they, are, anxious, to, acquire, a, new, volume, or, dimension, and, attempt, it, willingly, and, rapidly, and, occasionally, by, a, most, vigorous, effort, as, in, the, example, of, gunpowder, the, most, powerful, or, at, least, most, frequent, though, not, the, only, instruments, of, this, motion, are, heat, and, cold, for, instance, the, air, if, expanded, by, tension, (as, by, suction, in, the, glass, egg), struggles, anxiously, to, restore, itself, but, if, heat, be, applied, it, strives, on, the, contrary, to, dilate, itself, and, longs, for, a, larger, volume, regularly, passing, and, migrating, into, it, as, into, a, new, form, (as, it, is, termed), nor, after, a, certain, degree, of, expansion, is, it, anxious, to, return, unless, it, be, invited, to, do, so, by, the, application, of, cold, which, is, not, indeed, a, return, but, a, fresh, change, so, also, water, when, confined, by, compression, resists, and, wishes, to, become, as, it, was, before, namely, more, expanded, but, if, there, happen, an, intense, and, continued, cold, it, changes, itself, readily, and, of, its, own, accord, into, the, condensed, state, of, ice, and, if, the, cold, be, long, continued, without, any, intervening, warmth, (as, in, grottoes, and, deep, caves), it, is, changed, into, crystal, or, similar, matter, and, never, resumes, its, form, let, the, fifth, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, continuity, we, do, not, understand, by, this, simple, and, primary, continuity, with, any, other, body, (for, that, is, the, motion, of, connection), but, the, continuity, of, a, particular, body, in, itself, for, it, is, most, certain, that, all, bodies, abhor, a, solution, of, continuity, some, more, and, some, less, but, all, partially, in, hard, bodies, (such, as, steel, and, glass), the, resistance, to, an, interruption, of, continuity, is, most, powerful, and, efficacious, while, although, in, liquids, it, appears, to, be, faint, and, languid, yet, it, is, not, altogether, null, but, exists, in, the, lowest, degree, and, shows, itself, in, many, experiments, such, as, bubbles, the, round, form, of, drops, the, thin, threads, which, drip, from, roofs, the, cohesion, of, glutinous, substances, and, the, like, it, is, most, conspicuous, however, if, an, attempt, be, made, to, push, this, separation, to, still, smaller, particles, thus, in, mortars, the, pestle, produces, no, effect, after, a, certain, degree, of, contusion, water, does, not, penetrate, small, fissures, and, the, air, itself, notwithstanding, its, subtilty, does, not, penetrate, the, pores, of, solid, vessels, at, once, but, only, by, long-continued, insinuation, let, the, sixth, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, acquisition, or, the, motion, of, need, [151], it, is, that, by, which, bodies, placed, among, others, of, a, heterogeneous, and, as, it, were, hostile, nature, if, they, meet, with, the, means, or, opportunity, of, avoiding, them, and, uniting, themselves, with, others, of, a, more, analogous, nature, even, when, these, latter, are, not, closely, allied, to, them, immediately, seize, and, as, it, were, select, them, and, appear, to, consider, it, as, something, acquired, (whence, we, derive, the, name), and, to, have, need, of, these, latter, bodies, for, instance, gold, or, any, other, metal, in, leaf, does, not, like, the, neighborhood, of, air, if, therefore, they, meet, with, any, tangible, and, thick, substance, (such, as, the, finger, paper, or, the, like), they, immediately, adhere, to, it, and, are, not, easily, torn, from, it, paper, too, and, cloth, and, the, like, do, not, agree, with, the, air, which, is, inherent, and, mixed, in, their, pores, they, readily, therefore, imbibe, water, or, other, liquids, and, get, rid, of, the, air, sugar, or, a, sponge, dipped, in, water, or, wine, and, though, part, of, it, be, out, of, the, water, or, wine, and, at, some, height, above, it, will, yet, gradually, absorb, them, [152], hence, an, excellent, rule, is, derived, for, the, opening, and, dissolution, of, bodies, for, (not, to, mention, corrosive, and, strong, waters, which, force, their, way), if, a, body, can, be, found, which, is, more, adapted, suited, and, friendly, to, a, given, solid, than, that, with, which, it, is, by, some, necessity, united, the, given, solid, immediately, opens, and, dissolves, itself, to, receive, the, former, and, excludes, or, removes, the, latter, [153], nor, is, the, effect, or, power, of, this, motion, confined, to, contact, for, the, electric, energy, (of, which, gilbert, and, others, after, him, have, told, so, many, fables), is, only, the, energy, excited, in, a, body, by, gentle, friction, and, which, does, not, endure, the, air, but, prefers, some, tangible, substance, if, there, be, any, at, hand, let, the, seventh, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, greater, congregation, by, which, bodies, are, borne, toward, masses, of, a, similar, nature, for, instance, heavy, bodies, toward, the, earth, light, to, the, sphere, of, heaven, the, schools, termed, this, natural, motion, by, a, superficial, consideration, of, it, because, produced, by, no, external, visible, agent, which, made, them, consider, it, innate, in, the, substances, or, perhaps, because, it, does, not, cease, which, is, little, to, be, wondered, at, since, heaven, and, earth, are, always, present, while, the, causes, and, sources, of, many, other, motions, are, sometimes, absent, and, sometimes, present, they, therefore, called, this, perpetual, and, proper, because, it, is, never, interrupted, but, instantly, takes, place, when, the, others, are, interrupted, and, they, called, the, others, adscititious, the, former, however, is, in, reality, weak, and, slow, since, it, yields, and, is, inferior, to, the, others, as, long, as, they, act, unless, the, mass, of, the, body, be, great, and, although, this, motion, have, so, filled, men’s, minds, as, almost, to, have, obscured, all, others, yet, they, know, but, little, about, it, and, commit, many, errors, in, its, estimate, let, the, eighth, be, that, which, we, term, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, by, which, the, homogeneous, parts, in, any, body, separate, themselves, from, the, heterogeneous, and, unite, together, and, whole, bodies, of, a, similar, substance, coalesce, and, tend, toward, each, other, and, are, sometimes, congregated, attracted, and, meet, from, some, distance, thus, in, milk, the, cream, rises, after, a, certain, time, and, in, wine, the, dregs, and, tartar, sink, which, effects, are, not, to, be, attributed, to, gravity, and, levity, only, so, as, to, account, for, the, rising, of, some, parts, and, the, sinking, of, others, but, much, more, to, the, desire, of, the, homogeneous, bodies, to, meet, and, unite, this, motion, differs, from, that, of, need, in, two, points, st, because, the, latter, is, the, stimulus, of, a, malignant, and, contrary, nature, while, in, this, of, which, we, treat, (if, there, be, no, impediment, or, restraint), the, parts, are, united, by, their, affinity, although, there, be, no, foreign, nature, to, create, a, struggle, 2dly, because, the, union, is, closer, and, more, select, for, in, the, other, motion, bodies, which, have, no, great, affinity, unite, if, they, can, but, avoid, the, hostile, body, while, in, this, substances, which, are, connected, by, a, decided, kindred, resemblance, come, together, and, are, molded, into, one, it, is, a, motion, existing, in, all, compound, bodies, and, would, be, readily, seen, in, each, if, it, were, not, confined, and, checked, by, the, other, affections, and, necessities, of, bodies, which, disturb, the, union, this, motion, is, usually, confined, in, the, three, following, manners, by, the, torpor, of, the, bodies, by, the, power, of, the, predominating, body, by, external, motion, with, regard, to, the, first, it, is, certain, that, there, is, more, or, less, sluggishness, in, tangible, bodies, and, an, abhorrence, of, locomotion, so, that, unless, excited, they, prefer, remaining, contented, with, their, actual, state, to, placing, themselves, in, a, better, position, there, are, three, means, of, breaking, through, this, sluggishness--heat, the, active, power, of, a, similar, body, vivid, and, powerful, motion, with, regard, to, the, first, heat, is, on, this, account, defined, as, that, which, separates, heterogeneous, and, draws, together, homogeneous, substances, a, definition, of, the, peripatetics, which, is, justly, ridiculed, by, gilbert, who, says, it, is, as, if, one, were, to, define, man, to, be, that, which, sows, wheat, and, plants, vineyards, being, only, a, definition, deduced, from, effects, and, those, but, partial, but, it, is, still, more, to, be, blamed, because, those, effects, such, as, they, are, are, not, a, peculiar, property, of, heat, but, a, mere, accident, (for, cold, as, we, shall, afterward, show, does, the, same), arising, from, the, desire, of, the, homogeneous, parts, to, unite, the, heat, then, assists, them, in, breaking, through, that, sluggishness, which, before, restrained, their, desire, with, regard, to, the, assistance, derived, from, the, power, of, a, similar, body, it, is, most, conspicuous, in, the, magnet, when, armed, with, steel, for, it, excites, in, the, steel, a, power, of, adhering, to, steel, as, a, homogeneous, substance, the, power, of, the, magnet, breaking, through, the, sluggishness, of, the, steel, with, regard, to, the, assistance, of, motion, it, is, seen, in, wooden, arrows, or, points, which, penetrate, more, deeply, into, wood, than, if, they, were, tipped, with, iron, from, the, similarity, of, the, substance, the, swiftness, of, the, motion, breaking, through, the, sluggishness, of, the, wood, of, which, two, last, experiments, we, have, spoken, above, in, the, aphorism, on, clandestine, instances, [154], the, confinement, of, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, which, arises, from, the, power, of, the, predominant, body, is, shown, in, the, decomposition, of, blood, and, urine, by, cold, for, as, long, as, these, substances, are, filled, with, the, active, spirit, which, regulates, and, restrains, each, of, their, component, parts, as, the, predominant, ruler, of, the, whole, the, several, different, parts, do, not, collect, themselves, separately, on, account, of, the, check, but, as, soon, as, that, spirit, has, evaporated, or, has, been, choked, by, the, cold, then, the, decomposed, parts, unite, according, to, their, natural, desire, hence, it, happens, that, all, bodies, which, contain, a, sharp, spirit, (as, salts, and, the, like), last, without, decomposition, owing, to, the, permanent, and, durable, power, of, the, predominating, and, imperious, spirit, the, confinement, of, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, which, arises, from, external, motion, is, very, evident, in, that, agitation, of, bodies, which, preserves, them, from, putrefaction, for, all, putrefaction, depends, on, the, congregation, of, the, homogeneous, parts, whence, by, degrees, there, ensues, a, corruption, of, the, first, form, (as, it, is, called), and, the, generation, of, another, for, the, decomposition, of, the, original, form, which, is, itself, the, union, of, the, homogeneous, parts, precedes, the, putrefaction, which, prepares, the, way, for, the, generation, of, another, this, decomposition, if, not, interrupted, is, simple, but, if, there, be, various, obstacles, putrefactions, ensue, which, are, the, rudiments, of, a, new, generation, but, if, (to, come, to, our, present, point), a, frequent, agitation, be, excited, by, external, motion, the, motion, toward, union, (which, is, delicate, and, gentle, and, requires, to, be, free, from, all, external, influence), is, disturbed, and, ceases, which, we, perceive, to, be, the, case, in, innumerable, instances, thus, the, daily, agitation, or, flowing, of, water, prevents, putrefaction, winds, prevent, the, air, from, being, pestilent, corn, turned, about, and, shaken, in, granaries, continues, clean, in, short, everything, which, is, externally, agitated, will, with, difficulty, rot, internally, we, must, not, omit, that, union, of, the, parts, of, bodies, which, is, the, principal, cause, of, induration, and, desiccation, when, the, spirit, or, moisture, which, has, evaporated, into, spirit, has, escaped, from, a, porous, body, (such, as, wood, bone, parchment, and, the, like), the, thicker, parts, are, drawn, together, and, united, with, a, greater, effort, and, induration, or, desiccation, is, the, consequence, and, this, we, attribute, not, so, much, to, the, motion, of, connection, (in, order, to, prevent, a, vacuum), as, to, this, motion, of, friendship, and, union, union, from, a, distance, is, rare, and, yet, is, to, be, met, with, in, more, instances, than, are, generally, observed, we, perceive, it, when, one, bubble, dissolves, another, when, medicines, attract, humors, from, a, similarity, of, substance, when, one, string, moves, another, in, unison, with, it, on, different, instruments, and, the, like, we, are, of, opinion, that, this, motion, is, very, prevalent, also, in, animal, spirits, but, are, quite, ignorant, of, the, fact, it, is, however, conspicuous, in, the, magnet, and, magnetized, iron, while, speaking, of, the, motions, of, the, magnet, we, must, plainly, distinguish, them, for, there, are, four, distinct, powers, or, effects, of, the, magnet, which, should, not, be, confounded, although, the, wonder, and, astonishment, of, mankind, has, classed, them, together, 1, the, attraction, of, the, magnet, to, the, magnet, or, of, iron, to, the, magnet, or, of, magnetized, iron, to, iron, its, polarity, toward, the, north, and, south, and, its, variation, 3, its, penetration, through, gold, glass, stone, and, all, other, substances, the, communication, of, power, from, the, mineral, to, iron, and, from, iron, to, iron, without, any, communication, of, the, substances, here, however, we, only, speak, of, the, first, there, is, also, a, singular, motion, of, attraction, between, quicksilver, and, gold, so, that, the, gold, attracts, quicksilver, even, when, made, use, of, in, ointment, and, those, who, work, surrounded, by, the, vapors, of, quicksilver, are, wont, to, hold, a, piece, of, gold, in, their, mouths, to, collect, the, exhalations, which, would, otherwise, attack, their, heads, and, bones, and, this, piece, soon, grows, white, [155], let, this, suffice, for, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, let, the, ninth, be, the, magnetic, motion, which, although, of, the, nature, of, that, last, mentioned, yet, when, operating, at, great, distances, and, on, great, masses, deserves, a, separate, inquiry, especially, if, it, neither, begin, in, contact, as, most, motions, of, congregation, do, nor, end, by, bringing, the, substances, into, contact, as, all, do, but, only, raise, them, and, make, them, swell, without, any, further, effect, for, if, the, moon, raise, the, waters, or, cause, moist, substances, to, swell, or, if, the, starry, sphere, attract, the, planets, toward, their, apogees, or, the, sun, confine, the, planets, mercury, and, venus, to, within, a, certain, distance, of, his, mass, [156], these, motions, do, not, appear, capable, of, being, classed, under, either, of, those, of, congregation, but, to, be, as, it, were, intermediately, and, imperfectly, congregative, and, thus, to, form, a, distinct, species, let, the, tenth, motion, be, that, of, avoidance, or, that, which, is, opposed, to, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, by, which, bodies, with, a, kind, of, antipathy, avoid, and, disperse, and, separate, themselves, from, or, refuse, to, unite, themselves, with, others, of, a, hostile, nature, for, although, this, may, sometimes, appear, to, be, an, accidental, motion, necessarily, attendant, upon, that, of, the, lesser, congregation, because, the, homogeneous, parts, cannot, unite, unless, the, heterogeneous, be, first, removed, and, excluded, yet, it, is, still, to, be, classed, separately, [157], and, considered, as, a, distinct, species, because, in, many, cases, the, desire, of, avoidance, appears, to, be, more, marked, than, that, of, union, it, is, very, conspicuous, in, the, excrements, of, animals, nor, less, perhaps, in, objects, odious, to, particular, senses, especially, the, smell, and, taste, for, a, fetid, smell, is, rejected, by, the, nose, so, as, to, produce, a, sympathetic, motion, of, expulsion, at, the, mouth, of, the, stomach, a, bitter, and, rough, taste, is, rejected, by, the, palate, or, throat, so, as, to, produce, a, sympathetic, concussion, and, shivering, of, the, head, this, motion, is, visible, also, in, other, cases, thus, it, is, observed, in, some, kinds, of, antiperistasis, as, in, the, middle, region, of, the, air, the, cold, of, which, appears, to, be, occasioned, by, the, rejection, of, cold, from, the, regions, of, the, heavenly, bodies, and, also, in, the, heat, and, combustion, observed, in, subterranean, spots, which, appear, to, be, owing, to, the, rejection, of, heat, from, the, centre, of, the, earth, for, heat, and, cold, when, in, small, quantities, mutually, destroy, each, other, while, in, larger, quantities, like, armies, equally, matched, they, remove, and, eject, each, other, in, open, conflict, it, is, said, also, that, cinnamon, and, other, perfumes, retain, their, odor, longer, when, placed, near, privies, and, foul, places, because, they, will, not, unite, and, mix, with, stinks, it, is, well, known, that, quicksilver, which, would, otherwise, reunite, into, a, complete, mass, is, prevented, from, so, doing, by, man’s, spittle, pork, lard, turpentine, and, the, like, from, the, little, affinity, of, its, parts, with, those, substances, so, that, when, surrounded, by, them, it, draws, itself, back, and, its, avoidance, of, these, intervening, obstacles, is, greater, than, its, desire, of, reuniting, itself, to, its, homogeneous, parts, which, is, what, they, term, the, mortification, of, quicksilver, again, the, difference, in, weight, of, oil, and, water, is, not, the, only, reason, for, their, refusing, to, mix, but, it, is, also, owing, to, the, little, affinity, of, the, two, for, spirits, of, wine, which, are, lighter, than, oil, mix, very, well, with, water, very, remarkable, instance, of, the, motion, in, question, is, seen, in, nitre, and, crude, bodies, of, a, like, nature, which, abhor, flame, as, may, be, observed, in, gunpowder, quicksilver, and, gold, the, avoidance, of, one, pole, of, the, magnet, by, iron, is, not, (as, gilbert, has, well, observed), strictly, speaking, an, avoidance, but, a, conformity, or, attraction, to, a, more, convenient, situation, let, the, eleventh, motion, be, that, of, assimilation, or, self-multiplication, or, simple, generation, by, which, latter, term, we, do, not, mean, the, simple, generation, of, integral, bodies, such, as, plants, or, animals, but, of, homogeneous, bodies, by, this, motion, homogeneous, bodies, convert, those, which, are, allied, to, them, or, at, least, well, disposed, and, prepared, into, their, own, substance, and, nature, thus, flame, multiplies, itself, over, vapors, and, oily, substances, and, generates, fresh, flame, the, air, over, water, and, watery, substances, multiplies, itself, and, generates, fresh, air, the, vegetable, and, animal, spirit, over, the, thin, particles, of, a, watery, or, oleaginous, spirit, contained, in, its, food, multiplies, itself, and, generates, fresh, spirit, the, solid, parts, of, plants, and, animals, as, the, leaf, flower, the, flesh, bone, and, the, like, each, of, them, assimilate, some, part, of, the, juices, contained, in, their, food, and, generate, a, successive, and, daily, substance, for, let, none, rave, with, paracelsus, who, (blinded, by, his, distillations), would, have, it, that, nutrition, takes, place, by, mere, separation, and, that, the, eye, nose, brain, and, liver, lie, concealed, in, bread, and, meat, the, root, leaf, and, flower, in, the, juice, of, the, earth, asserting, that, just, as, the, artist, brings, out, a, leaf, flower, eye, nose, hand, foot, and, the, like, from, a, rude, mass, of, stone, or, wood, by, the, separation, and, rejection, of, what, is, superfluous, so, the, great, artist, within, us, brings, out, our, several, limbs, and, parts, by, separation, and, rejection, but, to, leave, such, trifling, it, is, most, certain, that, all, the, parts, of, vegetables, and, animals, as, well, the, homogeneous, as, organic, first, of, all, attract, those, juices, contained, in, their, food, which, are, nearly, common, or, at, least, not, very, different, and, then, assimilate, and, convert, them, into, their, own, nature, nor, does, this, assimilation, or, simple, generation, take, place, in, animated, bodies, only, but, the, inanimate, also, participate, in, the, same, property, (as, we, have, observed, of, flame, and, air), and, that, languid, spirit, which, is, contained, in, every, tangible, animated, substance, is, perpetually, working, upon, the, coarser, parts, and, converting, them, into, spirit, which, afterward, is, exhaled, whence, ensues, a, diminution, of, weight, and, a, desiccation, of, which, we, have, spoken, elsewhere, [158], nor, should, we, in, speaking, of, assimilation, neglect, to, mention, the, accretion, which, is, usually, distinguished, from, aliment, and, which, is, observed, when, mud, grows, into, a, mass, between, stones, and, is, converted, into, a, stony, substance, and, the, scaly, substance, round, the, teeth, is, converted, into, one, no, less, hard, than, the, teeth, themselves, for, we, are, of, opinion, that, there, exists, in, all, bodies, a, desire, of, assimilation, as, well, as, of, uniting, with, homogeneous, masses, each, of, these, powers, however, is, confined, although, in, different, manners, and, should, be, diligently, investigated, because, they, are, connected, with, the, revival, of, old, age, lastly, it, is, worthy, of, observation, that, in, the, nine, preceding, motions, bodies, appear, to, aim, at, the, mere, preservation, of, their, nature, while, in, this, they, attempt, its, propagation, let, the, twelfth, motion, be, that, of, excitement, which, appears, to, be, a, species, of, the, last, and, is, sometimes, mentioned, by, us, under, that, name, it, is, like, that, a, diffusive, communicative, transitive, and, multiplying, motion, and, they, agree, remarkably, in, their, effect, although, they, differ, in, their, mode, of, action, and, in, their, subject, matter, the, former, proceeds, imperiously, and, with, authority, it, orders, and, compels, the, assimilated, to, be, converted, and, changed, into, the, assimilating, body, the, latter, proceeds, by, art, insinuation, and, stealth, inviting, and, disposing, the, excited, toward, the, nature, of, the, exciting, body, the, former, both, multiplies, and, transforms, bodies, and, substances, thus, a, greater, quantity, of, flame, air, spirit, and, flesh, is, formed, but, in, the, latter, the, powers, only, are, multiplied, and, changed, and, heat, the, magnetic, power, and, putrefaction, in, the, above, instances, are, increased, heat, does, not, diffuse, itself, when, heating, other, bodies, by, any, communication, of, the, original, heat, but, only, by, exciting, the, parts, of, the, heated, body, to, that, motion, which, is, the, form, of, heat, and, of, which, we, spoke, in, the, first, vintage, of, the, nature, of, heat, heat, therefore, is, excited, much, less, rapidly, and, readily, in, stone, or, metal, than, in, air, on, account, of, the, inaptitude, and, sluggishness, of, those, bodies, in, acquiring, that, motion, so, that, it, is, probable, that, there, may, be, some, substances, toward, the, centre, of, the, earth, quite, incapable, of, being, heated, on, account, of, their, density, which, may, deprive, them, of, the, spirit, by, which, the, motion, of, excitement, is, usually, commenced, thus, also, the, magnet, creates, in, the, iron, a, new, disposition, of, its, parts, and, a, conformable, motion, without, losing, any, of, its, virtue, so, the, leaven, of, bread, yeast, rennet, and, some, poisons, excite, and, invite, successive, and, continued, motion, in, dough, beer, cheese, or, the, human, body, not, so, much, from, the, power, of, the, exciting, as, the, predisposition, and, yielding, of, the, excited, body, let, the, thirteenth, motion, be, that, of, impression, which, is, also, a, species, of, motion, of, assimilation, and, the, most, subtile, of, diffusive, motions, we, have, thought, it, right, however, to, consider, it, as, a, distinct, species, on, account, of, its, remarkable, difference, from, the, last, two, for, the, simple, motion, of, assimilation, transforms, the, bodies, themselves, so, that, if, you, remove, the, first, agent, you, diminish, not, the, effect, of, those, which, succeed, thus, neither, the, first, lighting, of, flame, nor, the, first, conversion, into, air, are, of, any, importance, to, the, flame, or, air, next, generated, so, also, the, motion, of, excitement, still, continues, for, a, considerable, time, after, the, removal, of, the, first, agent, as, in, a, heated, body, on, the, removal, of, the, original, heat, in, the, excited, iron, on, the, removal, of, the, magnet, and, in, the, dough, on, the, removal, of, the, leaven, but, the, motion, of, impression, although, diffusive, and, transitive, appears, nevertheless, to, depend, on, the, first, agent, so, that, upon, the, removal, of, the, latter, the, former, immediately, fails, and, perishes, for, which, reason, also, it, takes, effect, in, a, moment, or, at, least, a, very, short, space, of, time, we, are, wont, to, call, the, two, former, motions, the, motions, of, the, generation, of, jupiter, because, when, born, they, continue, to, exist, and, the, latter, the, motion, of, the, generation, of, saturn, because, it, is, immediately, devoured, and, absorbed, it, may, be, seen, in, three, instances, 1, in, the, rays, of, light, 2, in, the, percussions, of, sounds, 3, in, magnetic, attractions, as, regards, communication, for, on, the, removal, of, light, colors, and, all, its, other, images, disappear, as, on, the, cessation, of, the, first, percussion, and, the, vibration, of, the, body, sound, soon, fails, and, although, sounds, are, agitated, by, the, wind, like, waves, yet, it, is, to, be, observed, that, the, same, sound, does, not, last, during, the, whole, time, of, the, reverberation, thus, when, a, bell, is, struck, the, sound, appears, to, be, continued, for, a, considerable, time, and, one, might, easily, be, led, into, the, mistake, of, supposing, it, to, float, and, remain, in, the, air, during, the, whole, time, which, is, most, erroneous, [159], for, the, reverberation, is, not, one, identical, sound, but, the, repetition, of, sounds, which, is, made, manifest, by, stopping, and, confining, the, sonorous, body, thus, if, a, bell, be, stopped, and, held, tightly, so, as, to, be, immovable, the, sound, fails, and, there, is, no, further, reverberation, and, if, a, musical, string, be, touched, after, the, first, vibration, either, with, the, finger, (as, in, the, harp), or, a, quill, (as, in, the, harpsichord), the, sound, immediately, ceases, if, the, magnet, be, removed, the, iron, falls, the, moon, however, cannot, be, removed, from, the, sea, nor, the, earth, from, a, heavy, falling, body, and, we, can, therefore, make, no, experiment, upon, them, but, the, case, is, the, same, let, the, fourteenth, motion, be, that, configuration, or, position, by, which, bodies, appear, to, desire, a, peculiar, situation, collocation, and, configuration, with, others, rather, than, union, or, separation, this, is, a, very, abstruse, notion, and, has, not, been, well, investigated, and, in, some, instances, appears, to, occur, almost, without, any, cause, although, we, be, mistaken, in, supposing, this, to, be, really, the, case, for, if, it, be, asked, why, the, heavens, revolve, from, east, to, west, rather, than, from, west, to, east, or, why, they, turn, on, poles, situate, near, the, bears, rather, than, round, orion, or, any, other, part, of, the, heaven, such, a, question, appears, to, be, unreasonable, since, these, phenomena, should, be, received, as, determinate, and, the, objects, of, our, experience, there, are, indeed, some, ultimate, and, self-existing, phenomena, in, nature, but, those, which, we, have, just, mentioned, are, not, to, be, referred, to, that, class, for, we, attribute, them, to, a, certain, harmony, and, consent, of, the, universe, which, has, not, yet, been, properly, observed, but, if, the, motion, of, the, earth, from, west, to, east, be, allowed, the, same, question, may, be, put, for, it, must, also, revolve, round, certain, poles, and, why, should, they, be, placed, where, they, are, rather, than, elsewhere, the, polarity, and, variation, of, the, needle, come, under, our, present, head, there, is, also, observed, in, both, natural, and, artificial, bodies, especially, solids, rather, than, fluids, a, particular, collocation, and, position, of, parts, resembling, hairs, or, fibres, which, should, be, diligently, investigated, since, without, a, discovery, of, them, bodies, cannot, be, conveniently, controlled, or, wrought, upon, the, eddies, observable, in, liquids, by, which, when, compressed, they, successively, raise, different, parts, of, their, mass, before, they, can, escape, so, as, to, equalize, the, pressure, is, more, correctly, assigned, to, the, motion, of, liberty, let, the, fifteenth, motion, be, that, of, transmission, or, of, passage, by, which, the, powers, of, bodies, are, more, or, less, impeded, or, advanced, by, the, medium, according, to, the, nature, of, the, bodies, and, their, effective, powers, and, also, according, to, that, of, the, medium, for, one, medium, is, adapted, to, light, another, to, sound, another, to, heat, and, cold, another, to, magnetic, action, and, so, on, with, regard, to, the, other, actions, let, the, sixteenth, be, that, which, we, term, the, royal, or, political, motion, by, which, the, predominant, and, governing, parts, of, any, body, check, subdue, reduce, and, regulate, the, others, and, force, them, to, unite, separate, stand, still, move, or, assume, a, certain, position, not, from, any, inclination, of, their, own, but, according, to, a, certain, order, and, as, best, suits, the, convenience, of, the, governing, part, so, that, there, is, a, sort, of, dominion, and, civil, government, exercised, by, the, ruling, part, over, its, subjects, the, motion, is, very, conspicuous, in, the, spirits, of, animals, where, as, long, as, it, is, in, force, it, tempers, all, the, motions, of, the, other, parts, it, is, found, in, a, less, degree, in, other, bodies, as, we, have, observed, in, blood, and, urine, which, are, not, decomposed, until, the, spirit, which, mixed, and, retained, their, parts, has, been, emitted, or, extinguished, nor, is, this, motion, peculiar, to, spirits, only, although, in, most, bodies, the, spirit, predominates, owing, to, its, rapid, motion, and, penetration, for, the, grosser, parts, predominate, in, denser, bodies, which, are, not, filled, with, a, quick, and, active, spirit, (such, as, exists, in, quicksilver, or, vitriol), so, that, unless, this, check, or, yoke, be, thrown, off, by, some, contrivance, there, is, no, hope, of, any, transformation, of, such, bodies, and, let, not, any, one, suppose, that, we, have, forgotten, our, subject, because, we, speak, of, predominance, in, this, classification, of, motions, which, is, made, entirely, with, the, view, of, assisting, the, investigation, of, wrestling, instances, or, instances, of, predominance, for, we, do, not, now, treat, of, the, general, predominance, of, motions, or, powers, but, of, that, of, parts, in, whole, bodies, which, constitutes, the, particular, species, here, considered, let, the, seventeenth, motion, be, the, spontaneous, motion, of, revolution, by, which, bodies, having, a, tendency, to, move, and, placed, in, a, favorable, situation, enjoy, their, peculiar, nature, pursuing, themselves, and, nothing, else, and, seeking, as, it, were, to, embrace, themselves, for, bodies, seem, either, to, move, without, any, limit, or, to, tend, toward, a, limit, arrived, at, which, they, either, revolve, according, to, their, peculiar, nature, or, rest, those, which, are, favorably, situated, and, have, a, tendency, to, motion, move, in, a, circle, with, an, eternal, and, unlimited, motion, those, which, are, favorably, situated, and, abhor, motion, rest, those, which, are, not, favorably, situated, move, in, a, straight, line, (as, their, shortest, path), in, order, to, unite, with, others, of, a, congenial, nature, this, motion, of, revolution, admits, of, nine, differences, 1, with, regard, to, the, centre, about, which, the, bodies, move, 2, the, poles, round, which, they, move, 3, the, circumference, or, orbit, relatively, to, its, distance, from, the, centre, the, velocity, or, greater, or, less, speed, with, which, they, revolve, the, direction, of, the, motion, as, from, east, to, west, or, the, reverse, the, deviation, from, a, perfect, circle, by, spiral, lines, at, a, greater, or, less, distance, from, the, centre, 7, the, deviation, from, the, circle, by, spiral, lines, at, a, greater, or, less, distance, from, the, poles, 8, the, greater, or, less, distance, of, these, spirals, from, each, other, 9, and, lastly, the, variation, of, the, poles, if, they, be, movable, which, however, only, affects, revolution, when, circular, the, motion, in, question, is, according, to, common, and, long-received, opinion, considered, to, be, that, of, the, heavenly, bodies, there, exists, however, with, regard, to, this, a, considerable, dispute, between, some, of, the, ancients, as, well, as, moderns, who, have, attributed, a, motion, of, revolution, to, the, earth, much, more, reasonable, controversy, perhaps, exists, (if, it, be, not, a, matter, beyond, dispute), whether, the, motion, in, question, (on, the, hypothesis, of, the, earth’s, being, fixed), is, confined, to, the, heavens, or, rather, descends, and, is, communicated, to, the, air, and, water, the, rotation, of, missiles, as, in, darts, musket-balls, and, the, like, we, refer, entirely, to, the, motion, of, liberty, let, the, eighteenth, motion, be, that, of, trepidation, [160], to, which, (in, the, sense, assigned, to, it, by, astronomers), we, do, not, give, much, credit, but, in, our, serious, and, general, search, after, the, tendencies, of, natural, bodies, this, motion, occurs, and, appears, worthy, of, forming, a, distinct, species, it, is, the, motion, of, an, (as, it, were), eternal, captivity, when, bodies, for, instance, being, placed, not, altogether, according, to, their, nature, and, yet, not, exactly, ill, constantly, tremble, and, are, restless, not, contented, with, their, position, and, yet, not, daring, to, advance, such, is, the, motion, of, the, heart, and, pulse, of, animals, and, it, must, necessarily, occur, in, all, bodies, which, are, situated, in, a, mean, state, between, conveniences, and, inconveniences, so, that, being, removed, from, their, proper, position, they, strive, to, escape, are, repulsed, and, again, continue, to, make, the, attempt, let, the, nineteenth, and, last, motion, be, one, which, can, scarcely, be, termed, a, motion, and, yet, is, one, and, which, we, may, call, the, motion, of, repose, or, of, abhorrence, of, motion, it, is, by, this, motion, that, the, earth, stands, by, its, own, weight, while, its, extremes, move, toward, the, middle, not, to, an, imaginary, centre, but, in, order, to, unite, it, is, owing, to, the, same, tendency, that, all, bodies, of, considerable, density, abhor, motion, and, their, only, tendency, is, not, to, move, which, nature, they, preserve, although, excited, and, urged, in, a, variety, of, ways, to, motion, but, if, they, be, compelled, to, move, yet, do, they, always, appear, anxious, to, recover, their, former, state, and, to, cease, from, motion, in, which, respect, they, certainly, appear, active, and, attempt, it, with, sufficient, swiftness, and, rapidity, as, if, fatigued, and, impatient, of, delay, we, can, only, have, a, partial, representation, of, this, tendency, because, with, us, every, tangible, substance, is, not, only, not, condensed, to, the, utmost, but, even, some, spirit, is, added, owing, to, the, action, and, concocting, influence, of, the, heavenly, bodies, we, have, now, therefore, exhibited, the, species, or, simple, elements, of, the, motions, tendencies, and, active, powers, which, are, most, universal, in, nature, and, no, small, portion, of, natural, science, has, been, thus, sketched, out, we, do, not, however, deny, that, other, instances, can, perhaps, be, added, and, our, divisions, changed, according, to, some, more, natural, order, of, things, and, also, reduced, to, a, less, number, in, which, respect, we, do, not, allude, to, any, abstract, classification, as, if, one, were, to, say, that, bodies, desire, the, preservation, exaltation, propagation, or, fruition, of, their, nature, or, that, motion, tends, to, the, preservation, and, benefit, either, of, the, universe, (as, in, the, case, of, those, of, resistance, and, connection), or, of, extensive, wholes, as, in, the, case, of, those, of, the, greater, congregation, revolution, and, abhorrence, of, motion, or, of, particular, forms, as, in, the, case, of, the, others, for, although, such, remarks, be, just, yet, unless, they, terminate, in, matter, and, construction, according, to, true, definitions, they, are, speculative, and, of, little, use, in, the, meantime, our, classification, will, suffice, and, be, of, much, use, in, the, consideration, of, the, predominance, of, powers, and, examining, the, wrestling, instances, which, constitute, our, present, subject, for, of, the, motions, here, laid, down, some, are, quite, invincible, some, more, powerful, than, others, which, they, confine, check, and, modify, others, extend, to, a, greater, distance, others, are, more, immediate, and, swift, others, strengthen, increase, and, accelerate, the, rest, the, motion, of, resistance, is, most, adamantine, and, invincible, we, are, yet, in, doubt, whether, such, be, the, nature, of, that, of, connection, for, we, cannot, with, certainty, determine, whether, there, be, a, vacuum, either, extensive, or, intermixed, with, matter, of, one, thing, however, we, are, satisfied, that, the, reason, assigned, by, leucippus, and, democritus, for, the, introduction, of, a, vacuum, (namely, that, the, same, bodies, could, not, otherwise, comprehend, and, fill, greater, and, less, spaces), is, false, for, there, is, clearly, a, folding, of, matter, by, which, it, wraps, and, unwraps, itself, in, space, within, certain, limits, without, the, intervention, of, a, vacuum, nor, is, there, two, thousand, times, more, of, vacuum, in, air, than, in, gold, as, there, should, be, on, this, hypothesis, a, fact, demonstrated, by, the, very, powerful, energies, of, fluids, (which, would, otherwise, float, like, fine, dust, _in, vacuo_), and, many, other, proofs, the, other, motions, direct, and, are, directed, by, each, other, according, to, their, strength, quantity, excitement, emission, or, the, assistance, or, impediments, they, meet, with, for, instance, some, armed, magnets, hold, and, support, iron, of, sixty, times, their, own, weight, so, far, does, the, motion, of, lesser, congregation, predominate, over, that, of, the, greater, but, if, the, weight, be, increased, it, yields, lever, of, a, certain, strength, will, raise, a, given, weight, and, so, far, the, motion, of, liberty, predominates, over, that, of, the, greater, congregation, but, if, the, weight, be, greater, the, former, motion, yields, piece, of, leather, stretched, to, a, certain, point, does, not, break, and, so, far, the, motion, of, continuity, predominates, over, that, of, tension, but, if, the, tension, be, greater, the, leather, breaks, and, the, motion, of, continuity, yields, certain, quantity, of, water, flows, through, a, chink, and, so, far, the, motion, of, greater, congregation, predominates, over, that, of, continuity, but, if, the, chink, be, smaller, it, yields, if, a, musket, be, charged, with, ball, and, powdered, sulphur, alone, and, fire, be, applied, the, ball, is, not, discharged, in, which, case, the, motion, of, greater, congregation, overcomes, that, of, matter, but, when, gunpowder, is, used, the, motion, of, matter, in, the, sulphur, predominates, being, assisted, by, that, motion, and, the, motion, of, avoidance, in, the, nitre, and, so, of, the, rest, for, wrestling, instances, (which, show, the, predominance, of, powers, and, in, what, manner, and, proportion, they, predominate, and, yield), must, be, searched, for, with, active, and, industrious, diligence, the, methods, and, nature, of, this, yielding, must, also, be, diligently, examined, as, for, instance, whether, the, motions, completely, cease, or, exert, themselves, but, are, constrained, for, in, the, bodies, with, which, we, are, acquainted, there, is, no, real, but, an, apparent, rest, either, in, the, whole, or, in, parts, this, apparent, rest, is, occasioned, either, by, equilibrium, or, the, absolute, predominance, of, motions, by, equilibrium, as, in, the, scales, of, the, balance, which, rest, if, the, weights, be, equal, by, predominance, as, in, perforated, jars, in, which, the, water, rests, and, is, prevented, from, falling, by, the, predominance, of, the, motion, of, connection, it, is, however, to, be, observed, (as, we, have, said, before), how, far, the, yielding, motions, exert, themselves, for, if, a, man, be, held, stretched, out, on, the, ground, against, his, will, with, arms, and, legs, bound, down, or, otherwise, confined, and, yet, strive, with, all, his, power, to, get, up, the, struggle, is, not, the, less, although, ineffectual, the, real, state, of, the, case, (namely, whether, the, yielding, motion, be, as, it, were, annihilated, by, the, predominance, or, there, be, rather, a, continued, although, an, invisible, effort), will, perhaps, appear, in, the, concurrence, of, motions, although, it, escape, our, notice, in, their, conflict, for, instance, let, an, experiment, be, made, with, muskets, whether, a, musket-ball, at, its, utmost, range, in, a, straight, line, or, (as, it, is, commonly, called), point-blank, strike, with, less, force, when, projected, upward, where, the, motion, of, the, blow, is, simple, than, when, projected, downward, where, the, motion, of, gravity, concurs, with, the, blow, the, rules, of, such, instances, of, predominance, as, occur, should, be, collected, such, as, the, following, the, more, general, the, desired, advantage, is, the, stronger, will, be, the, motion, the, motion, of, connection, for, instance, which, relates, to, the, intercourse, of, the, parts, of, the, universe, is, more, powerful, than, that, of, gravity, which, relates, to, the, intercourse, of, dense, bodies, only, again, the, desire, of, a, private, good, does, not, in, general, prevail, against, that, of, a, public, one, except, where, the, quantities, are, small, would, that, such, were, the, case, in, civil, matters, in, the, twenty-fifth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, suggesting, instances, such, as, suggest, or, point, out, that, which, is, advantageous, to, mankind, for, bare, power, and, knowledge, in, themselves, exalt, rather, than, enrich, human, nature, we, must, therefore, select, from, the, general, store, such, things, as, are, most, useful, to, mankind, we, shall, have, a, better, opportunity, of, discussing, these, when, we, treat, of, the, application, to, practice, besides, in, the, work, of, interpretation, we, leave, room, on, every, subject, for, the, human, or, optative, chart, for, it, is, a, part, of, science, to, make, judicious, inquiries, and, wishes, in, the, twenty-sixth, rank, of, prerogative, instances, we, will, place, the, generally, useful, instances, they, are, such, as, relate, to, various, points, and, frequently, occur, sparing, by, that, means, considerable, labor, and, new, trials, the, proper, place, for, treating, of, instruments, and, contrivances, will, be, that, in, which, we, speak, of, the, application, to, practice, and, the, methods, of, experiment, all, that, has, hitherto, been, ascertained, and, made, use, of, will, be, described, in, the, particular, history, of, each, art, at, present, we, will, subjoin, a, few, general, examples, of, the, instances, in, question, man, acts, then, upon, natural, bodies, (besides, merely, bringing, them, together, or, removing, them), by, seven, principal, methods, 1, by, the, exclusion, of, all, that, impedes, and, disturbs, 2, by, compression, extension, agitation, and, the, like, 3, by, heat, and, cold, 4, by, detention, in, a, suitable, place, 5, by, checking, or, directing, motion, by, peculiar, harmonies, 7, by, a, seasonable, and, proper, alternation, series, and, succession, of, all, these, or, at, least, of, some, of, them, with, regard, to, the, first--common, air, which, is, always, at, hand, and, forces, its, admission, as, also, the, rays, of, the, heavenly, bodies, create, much, disturbance, whatever, therefore, tends, to, exclude, them, may, well, be, considered, as, generally, useful, the, substance, and, thickness, of, vessels, in, which, bodies, are, placed, when, prepared, for, operations, may, be, referred, to, this, head, so, also, may, the, accurate, methods, of, closing, vessels, by, consolidation, or, the, _lutum, sapientiæ_, as, the, chemists, call, it, the, exclusion, of, air, by, means, of, liquids, at, the, extremity, is, also, very, useful, as, when, they, pour, oil, on, wine, or, the, juices, of, herbs, which, by, spreading, itself, upon, the, top, like, a, cover, preserves, them, uninjured, from, the, air, powders, also, are, serviceable, for, although, they, contain, air, mixed, up, in, them, yet, they, ward, off, the, power, of, the, mass, of, circumambient, air, which, is, seen, in, the, preservation, of, grapes, and, other, fruits, in, sand, or, flour, wax, honey, pitch, and, other, resinous, bodies, are, well, used, in, order, to, make, the, exclusion, more, perfect, and, to, remove, the, air, and, celestial, influence, we, have, sometimes, made, an, experiment, by, placing, a, vessel, or, other, bodies, in, quicksilver, the, most, dense, of, all, substances, capable, of, being, poured, round, others, grottoes, and, subterraneous, caves, are, of, great, use, in, keeping, off, the, effects, of, the, sun, and, the, predatory, action, of, air, and, in, the, north, of, germany, are, used, for, granaries, the, depositing, of, bodies, at, the, bottom, of, water, may, be, also, mentioned, here, and, remember, having, heard, of, some, bottles, of, wine, being, let, down, into, a, deep, well, in, order, to, cool, them, but, left, there, by, chance, carelessness, and, forgetfulness, for, several, years, and, then, taken, out, by, which, means, the, wine, not, only, escaped, becoming, flat, or, dead, but, was, much, more, excellent, in, flavor, arising, (as, it, appears), from, a, more, complete, mixture, of, its, parts, but, if, the, case, require, that, bodies, should, be, sunk, to, the, bottom, of, water, as, in, rivers, or, the, sea, and, yet, should, not, touch, the, water, nor, be, inclosed, in, sealed, vessels, but, surrounded, only, by, air, it, would, be, right, to, use, that, vessel, which, has, been, sometimes, employed, under, water, above, ships, that, have, sunk, in, order, to, enable, the, divers, to, remain, below, and, breathe, occasionally, by, turns, it, was, of, the, following, nature, hollow, tub, of, metal, was, formed, and, sunk, so, as, to, have, its, bottom, parallel, with, the, surface, of, the, water, it, thus, carried, down, with, it, to, the, bottom, of, the, sea, all, the, air, contained, in, the, tub, it, stood, upon, three, feet, (like, a, tripod), being, of, rather, less, height, than, a, man, so, that, when, the, diver, was, in, want, of, breath, he, could, put, his, head, into, the, hollow, of, the, tub, breathe, and, then, continue, his, work, we, hear, that, some, sort, of, boat, or, vessel, has, now, been, invented, capable, of, carrying, men, some, distance, under, water, any, bodies, however, can, easily, be, suspended, under, some, such, vessel, as, we, have, mentioned, which, has, occasioned, our, remarks, upon, the, experiment, another, advantage, of, the, careful, and, hermetical, closing, of, bodies, is, this--not, only, the, admission, of, external, air, is, prevented, (of, which, we, have, treated), but, the, spirit, of, bodies, also, is, prevented, from, making, its, escape, which, is, an, internal, operation, for, any, one, operating, on, natural, bodies, must, be, certain, as, to, their, quantity, and, that, nothing, has, evaporated, or, escaped, since, profound, alterations, take, place, in, bodies, when, art, prevents, the, loss, or, escape, of, any, portion, while, nature, prevents, their, annihilation, with, regard, to, this, circumstance, a, false, idea, has, prevailed, (which, if, true, would, make, us, despair, of, preserving, quantity, without, diminution), namely, that, the, spirit, of, bodies, and, air, when, rarefied, by, a, great, degree, of, heat, cannot, be, so, kept, in, by, being, inclosed, in, any, vessel, as, not, to, escape, by, the, small, pores, men, are, led, into, this, idea, by, the, common, experiments, of, a, cup, inverted, over, water, with, a, candle, or, piece, of, lighted, paper, in, it, by, which, the, water, is, drawn, up, and, of, those, cups, which, when, heated, draw, up, the, flesh, for, they, think, that, in, each, experiment, the, rarefied, air, escapes, and, that, its, quantity, is, therefore, diminished, by, which, means, the, water, or, flesh, rises, by, the, motion, of, connection, this, is, however, most, incorrect, for, the, air, is, not, diminished, in, quantity, but, contracted, in, dimensions, [161], nor, does, this, motion, of, the, rising, of, the, water, begin, till, the, flame, is, extinguished, or, the, air, cooled, so, that, physicians, place, cold, sponges, moistened, with, water, on, the, cups, in, order, to, increase, their, attraction, there, is, therefore, no, reason, why, men, should, fear, much, from, the, ready, escape, of, air, for, although, it, be, true, that, the, most, solid, bodies, have, their, pores, yet, neither, air, nor, spirit, readily, suffers, itself, to, be, rarefied, to, such, an, extreme, degree, just, as, water, will, not, escape, by, a, small, chink, with, regard, to, the, second, of, the, seven, above-mentioned, methods, we, must, especially, observe, that, compression, and, similar, violence, have, a, most, powerful, effect, either, in, producing, locomotion, and, other, motions, of, the, same, nature, as, may, be, observed, in, engines, and, projectiles, or, in, destroying, the, organic, body, and, those, qualities, which, consist, entirely, in, motion, (for, all, life, and, every, description, of, flame, and, ignition, are, destroyed, by, compression, which, also, injures, and, deranges, every, machine), or, in, destroying, those, qualities, which, consist, in, position, and, a, coarse, difference, of, parts, as, in, colors, for, the, color, of, a, flower, when, whole, differs, from, that, it, presents, when, bruised, and, the, same, may, be, observed, of, whole, and, powdered, amber, or, in, tastes, for, the, taste, of, a, pear, before, it, is, ripe, and, of, the, same, pear, when, bruised, and, softened, is, different, since, it, becomes, perceptibly, more, sweet, but, such, violence, is, of, little, avail, in, the, more, noble, transformations, and, changes, of, homogeneous, bodies, for, they, do, not, by, such, means, acquire, any, constantly, and, permanently, new, state, but, one, that, is, transitory, and, always, struggling, to, return, to, its, former, habit, and, freedom, it, would, not, however, be, useless, to, make, some, more, diligent, experiments, with, regard, to, this, whether, for, instance, the, condensation, of, a, perfectly, homogeneous, body, (such, as, air, water, oil, and, the, like), or, their, rarefaction, when, effected, by, violence, can, become, permanent, fixed, and, as, it, were, so, changed, as, to, become, a, nature, this, might, at, first, be, tried, by, simple, perseverance, and, then, by, means, of, helps, and, harmonies, it, might, readily, have, been, attempted, (if, we, had, but, thought, of, it), when, we, condensed, water, (as, was, mentioned, above), by, hammering, and, compression, until, it, burst, out, for, we, ought, to, have, left, the, flattened, globe, untouched, for, some, days, and, then, to, have, drawn, off, the, water, in, order, to, try, whether, it, would, have, immediately, occupied, the, same, dimensions, as, it, did, before, the, condensation, if, it, had, not, done, so, either, immediately, or, soon, afterward, the, condensation, would, have, appeared, to, have, been, rendered, constant, if, not, it, would, have, appeared, that, a, restitution, took, place, and, that, the, condensation, had, been, transitory, something, of, the, same, kind, might, have, been, tried, with, the, glass, eggs, the, egg, should, have, been, sealed, up, suddenly, and, firmly, after, a, complete, exhaustion, of, the, air, and, should, have, been, allowed, to, remain, so, for, some, days, and, it, might, then, have, been, tried, whether, on, opening, the, aperture, the, air, would, be, drawn, in, with, a, hissing, noise, or, whether, as, much, water, would, be, drawn, into, it, when, immersed, as, would, have, been, drawn, into, it, at, first, if, it, had, not, continued, sealed, for, it, is, probable, (or, at, least, worth, making, the, experiment), that, this, might, have, happened, or, might, happen, because, perseverance, has, a, similar, effect, upon, bodies, which, are, a, little, less, homogeneous, stick, bent, together, for, some, time, does, not, rebound, which, is, not, owing, to, any, loss, of, quantity, in, the, wood, during, the, time, for, the, same, would, occur, (after, a, larger, time), in, a, plate, of, steel, which, does, not, evaporate, if, the, experiment, of, simple, perseverance, should, fail, the, matter, should, not, be, given, up, but, other, means, should, be, employed, for, it, would, be, no, small, advantage, if, bodies, could, be, endued, with, fixed, and, constant, natures, by, violence, air, could, then, be, converted, into, water, by, condensation, with, other, similar, effects, for, man, is, more, the, master, of, violent, motions, than, of, any, other, means, the, third, of, our, seven, methods, is, referred, to, that, great, practical, engine, of, nature, as, well, as, of, art, cold, and, heat, here, man’s, power, limps, as, it, were, with, one, leg, for, we, possess, the, heat, of, fire, which, is, infinitely, more, powerful, and, intense, than, that, of, the, sun, (as, it, reaches, us), and, that, of, animals, but, we, want, cold, [162], except, such, as, we, can, obtain, in, winter, in, caverns, or, by, surrounding, objects, with, snow, and, ice, which, perhaps, may, be, compared, in, degree, with, the, noontide, heat, of, the, sun, in, tropical, countries, increased, by, the, reflection, of, mountains, and, walls, for, this, degree, of, heat, and, cold, can, be, borne, for, a, short, period, only, by, animals, yet, it, is, nothing, compared, with, the, heat, of, a, burning, furnace, or, the, corresponding, degree, of, cold, [163], everything, with, us, has, a, tendency, to, become, rarefied, dry, and, wasted, and, nothing, to, become, condensed, or, soft, except, by, mixtures, and, as, it, were, spurious, methods, instances, of, cold, therefore, should, be, searched, for, most, diligently, such, as, may, be, found, by, exposing, bodies, upon, buildings, in, a, hard, frost, in, subterraneous, caverns, by, surrounding, bodies, with, snow, and, ice, in, deep, places, excavated, for, that, purpose, by, letting, bodies, down, into, wells, by, burying, bodies, in, quicksilver, and, metals, by, immersing, them, in, streams, which, petrify, wood, by, burying, them, in, the, earth, (which, the, chinese, are, reported, to, do, with, their, china, masses, of, which, made, for, that, purpose, are, said, to, remain, in, the, ground, for, forty, or, fifty, years, and, to, be, transmitted, to, their, heirs, as, a, sort, of, artificial, mine), and, the, like, the, condensations, which, take, place, in, nature, by, means, of, cold, should, also, be, investigated, that, by, learning, their, causes, they, may, be, introduced, into, the, arts, such, as, are, observed, in, the, exudation, of, marble, and, stones, in, the, dew, upon, the, panes, of, glass, in, a, room, toward, morning, after, a, frosty, night, in, the, formation, and, the, gathering, of, vapors, under, the, earth, into, water, whence, spring, fountains, and, the, like, besides, the, substances, which, are, cold, to, the, touch, there, are, others, which, have, also, the, effect, of, cold, and, condense, they, appear, however, to, act, only, upon, the, bodies, of, animals, and, scarcely, any, further, of, these, we, have, many, instances, in, medicines, and, plasters, some, condense, the, flesh, and, tangible, parts, such, as, astringent, and, inspissating, medicines, others, the, spirits, such, as, soporifics, there, are, two, modes, of, condensing, the, spirits, by, soporifics, or, provocatives, to, sleep, the, one, by, calming, the, motion, the, other, by, expelling, the, spirit, the, violet, dried, roses, lettuces, and, other, benign, or, mild, remedies, by, their, friendly, and, gently, cooling, vapors, invite, the, spirits, to, unite, and, restrain, their, violent, and, perturbed, motion, rose-water, for, instance, applied, to, the, nostrils, in, fainting, fits, causes, the, resolved, and, relaxed, spirits, to, recover, themselves, and, as, it, were, cherishes, them, but, opiates, and, the, like, banish, the, spirits, by, their, malignant, and, hostile, quality, if, they, be, applied, therefore, externally, the, spirits, immediately, quit, the, part, and, no, longer, readily, flow, into, it, but, if, they, be, taken, internally, their, vapor, mounting, to, the, head, expels, in, all, directions, the, spirits, contained, in, the, ventricles, of, the, brain, and, since, these, spirits, retreat, but, cannot, escape, they, consequently, meet, and, are, condensed, and, are, sometimes, completely, extinguished, and, suffocated, although, the, same, opiates, when, taken, in, moderation, by, a, secondary, accident, (the, condensation, which, succeeds, their, union), strengthen, the, spirits, render, them, more, robust, and, check, their, useless, and, inflammatory, motion, by, which, means, they, contribute, not, a, little, to, the, cure, of, diseases, and, the, prolongation, of, life, the, preparations, of, bodies, also, for, the, reception, of, cold, should, not, be, omitted, such, as, that, water, a, little, warmed, is, more, easily, frozen, than, that, which, is, quite, cold, and, the, like, moreover, since, nature, supplies, cold, so, sparingly, we, must, act, like, the, apothecaries, who, when, they, cannot, obtain, any, simple, ingredient, take, a, succedaneum, or, _quid, pro, quo_, as, they, term, it, such, as, aloes, for, xylobalsamum, cassia, for, cinnamon, in, the, same, manner, we, should, look, diligently, about, us, to, ascertain, whether, there, may, be, any, substitutes, for, cold, that, is, to, say, in, what, other, manner, condensation, can, be, effected, which, is, the, peculiar, operation, of, cold, such, condensations, appear, hitherto, to, be, of, four, kinds, only, 1, by, simple, compression, which, is, of, little, avail, toward, permanent, condensation, on, account, of, the, elasticity, of, substances, but, may, still, however, be, of, some, assistance, 2, by, the, contraction, of, the, coarser, after, the, escape, or, departure, of, the, finer, parts, of, a, given, body, as, is, exemplified, in, induration, by, fire, and, the, repeated, heating, and, extinguishing, of, metals, and, the, like, 3, by, the, cohesion, of, the, most, solid, homogeneous, parts, of, a, given, body, which, were, previously, separated, and, mixed, with, others, less, solid, as, in, the, return, of, sublimated, mercury, to, its, simple, state, in, which, it, occupies, much, less, space, than, it, did, in, powder, and, the, same, may, be, observed, of, the, cleansing, of, all, metals, from, their, dross, 4, by, harmony, or, the, application, of, substances, which, condense, by, some, latent, power, these, harmonies, are, as, yet, but, rarely, observed, at, which, we, cannot, be, surprised, since, there, is, little, to, hope, for, from, their, investigation, unless, the, discovery, of, forms, and, confirmation, be, attained, with, regard, to, animal, bodies, it, is, not, to, be, questioned, that, there, are, many, internal, and, external, medicines, which, condense, by, harmony, as, we, have, before, observed, but, this, action, is, rare, in, inanimate, bodies, written, accounts, as, well, as, report, have, certainly, spoken, of, a, tree, in, one, of, the, tercera, or, canary, islands, (for, do, not, exactly, recollect, which), that, drips, perpetually, so, as, to, supply, the, inhabitants, in, some, degree, with, water, and, paracelsus, says, that, the, herb, called, _ros, solis_, is, filled, with, dew, at, noon, while, the, sun, gives, out, its, greatest, heat, and, all, other, herbs, around, it, are, dry, we, treat, both, these, accounts, as, fables, they, would, however, if, true, be, of, the, most, important, service, and, most, worthy, of, examination, as, to, the, honey-dew, resembling, manna, which, is, found, in, may, on, the, leaves, of, the, oak, we, are, of, opinion, that, it, is, not, condensed, by, any, harmony, or, peculiarity, of, the, oak, leaf, but, that, while, it, falls, equally, upon, other, leaves, it, is, retained, and, continues, on, those, of, the, oak, because, their, texture, is, closer, and, not, so, porous, as, that, of, most, of, the, other, leaves, [164], with, regard, to, heat, man, possesses, abundant, means, and, power, but, his, observation, and, inquiry, are, defective, in, some, respects, and, those, of, the, greatest, importance, notwithstanding, the, boasting, of, quacks, for, the, effects, of, intense, heat, are, examined, and, observed, while, those, of, a, more, gentle, degree, of, heat, being, of, the, most, frequent, occurrence, in, the, paths, of, nature, are, on, that, very, account, least, known, we, see, therefore, the, furnaces, which, are, most, esteemed, employed, in, increasing, the, spirits, of, bodies, to, a, great, extent, as, in, the, strong, acids, and, some, chemical, oils, while, the, tangible, parts, are, hardened, and, when, the, volatile, part, has, escaped, become, sometimes, fixed, the, homogeneous, parts, are, separated, and, the, heterogeneous, incorporated, and, agglomerated, in, a, coarse, lump, and, (what, is, chiefly, worthy, of, remark), the, junction, of, compound, bodies, and, the, more, delicate, conformations, are, destroyed, and, confounded, but, the, operation, of, a, less, violent, heat, should, be, tried, and, investigated, by, which, more, delicate, mixtures, and, regular, conformations, may, be, produced, and, elicited, according, to, the, example, of, nature, and, in, imitation, of, the, effect, of, the, sun, which, we, have, alluded, to, in, the, aphorism, on, the, instances, of, alliance, for, the, works, of, nature, are, carried, on, in, much, smaller, portions, and, in, more, delicate, and, varied, positions, than, those, of, fire, as, we, now, employ, it, but, man, will, then, appear, to, have, really, augmented, his, power, when, the, works, of, nature, can, be, imitated, in, species, perfected, in, power, and, varied, in, quantity, to, which, should, be, added, the, acceleration, in, point, of, time, rust, for, instance, is, the, result, of, a, long, process, but, _crocus, martis_, is, obtained, immediately, and, the, same, may, be, observed, of, natural, verdigris, and, ceruse, crystal, is, formed, slowly, while, glass, is, blown, immediately, stones, increase, slowly, while, bricks, are, baked, immediately, etc, in, the, meantime, (with, regard, to, our, present, subject), every, different, species, of, heat, should, with, its, peculiar, effects, be, diligently, collected, and, inquired, into, that, of, the, heavenly, bodies, whether, their, rays, be, direct, reflected, or, refracted, or, condensed, by, a, burning-glass, that, of, lightning, flame, and, ignited, charcoal, that, of, fire, of, different, materials, either, open, or, confined, straitened, or, overflowing, qualified, by, the, different, forms, of, the, furnaces, excited, by, the, bellows, or, quiescent, removed, to, a, greater, or, less, distance, or, passing, through, different, media, moist, heats, such, as, the, _balneum, mariæ_, and, the, dunghill, the, external, and, internal, heat, of, animals, dry, heats, such, as, the, heat, of, ashes, lime, warm, sand, in, short, the, nature, of, every, kind, of, heat, and, its, degrees, we, should, however, particularly, attend, to, the, investigation, and, discovery, of, the, effects, and, operations, of, heat, when, made, to, approach, and, retire, by, degrees, regularly, periodically, and, by, proper, intervals, of, space, and, time, for, this, systematical, inequality, is, in, truth, the, daughter, of, heaven, and, mother, of, generation, nor, can, any, great, result, be, expected, from, a, vehement, precipitate, or, desultory, heat, for, this, is, not, only, most, evident, in, vegetables, but, in, the, wombs, of, animals, also, there, arises, a, great, inequality, of, heat, from, the, motion, sleep, food, and, passions, of, the, female, the, same, inequality, prevails, in, those, subterraneous, beds, where, metals, and, fossils, are, perpetually, forming, which, renders, yet, more, remarkable, the, ignorance, of, some, of, the, reformed, alchemists, who, imagined, they, could, attain, their, object, by, the, equable, heat, of, lamps, or, the, like, burning, uniformly, let, this, suffice, concerning, the, operation, and, effects, of, heat, nor, is, it, time, for, us, to, investigate, them, thoroughly, before, the, forms, and, conformations, of, bodies, have, been, further, examined, and, brought, to, light, when, we, have, determined, upon, our, models, we, may, seek, apply, and, arrange, our, instruments, the, fourth, mode, of, action, is, by, continuance, the, very, steward, and, almoner, as, it, were, of, nature, we, apply, the, term, continuance, to, the, abandonment, of, a, body, to, itself, for, an, observable, time, guarded, and, protected, in, the, meanwhile, from, all, external, force, for, the, internal, motion, then, commences, to, betray, and, exert, itself, when, the, external, and, adventitious, is, removed, the, effects, of, time, however, are, far, more, delicate, than, those, of, fire, wine, for, instance, cannot, be, clarified, by, fire, as, it, is, by, continuance, nor, are, the, ashes, produced, by, combustion, so, fine, as, the, particles, dissolved, or, wasted, by, the, lapse, of, ages, the, incorporations, and, mixtures, which, are, hurried, by, fire, are, very, inferior, to, those, obtained, by, continuance, and, the, various, conformations, assumed, by, bodies, left, to, themselves, such, as, mouldiness, etc, are, put, a, stop, to, by, fire, or, a, strong, heat, it, is, not, in, the, meantime, unimportant, to, remark, that, there, is, a, certain, degree, of, violence, in, the, motion, of, bodies, entirely, confined, for, the, confinement, impedes, the, proper, motion, of, the, body, continuance, in, an, open, vessel, therefore, is, useful, for, separations, and, in, one, hermetically, sealed, for, mixtures, that, in, a, vessel, partly, closed, but, admitting, the, air, for, putrefaction, but, instances, of, the, operation, and, effect, of, continuance, must, be, collected, diligently, from, every, quarter, the, direction, of, motion, (which, is, the, fifth, method, of, action), is, of, no, small, use, we, adopt, this, term, when, speaking, of, a, body, which, meeting, with, another, either, arrests, repels, allows, or, directs, its, original, motion, this, is, the, case, principally, in, the, figure, and, position, of, vessels, an, upright, cone, for, instance, promotes, the, condensation, of, vapor, in, alembics, but, when, reversed, as, in, inverted, vessels, it, assists, the, refining, of, sugar, sometimes, a, curved, form, or, one, alternately, contracted, and, dilated, is, required, strainers, may, be, ranged, under, this, head, where, the, opposed, body, opens, a, way, for, one, portion, of, another, substance, and, impedes, the, rest, nor, is, this, process, or, any, other, direction, of, motion, carried, on, externally, only, but, sometimes, by, one, body, within, another, thus, pebbles, are, thrown, into, water, to, collect, the, muddy, particles, and, syrups, are, refined, by, the, white, of, an, egg, which, glues, the, grosser, particles, together, so, as, to, facilitate, their, removal, telesius, indeed, rashly, and, ignorantly, enough, attributes, the, formation, of, animals, to, this, cause, by, means, of, the, channels, and, folds, of, the, womb, he, ought, to, have, observed, a, similar, formation, of, the, young, in, eggs, which, have, no, wrinkles, or, inequalities, one, may, observe, a, real, result, of, this, direction, of, motion, in, casting, and, modelling, the, effects, produced, by, harmony, and, aversion, (which, is, the, sixth, method), are, frequently, buried, in, obscurity, for, these, occult, and, specific, properties, (as, they, are, termed), the, sympathies, and, antipathies, are, for, the, most, part, but, a, corruption, of, philosophy, nor, can, we, form, any, great, expectation, of, the, discovery, of, the, harmony, which, exists, between, natural, objects, before, that, of, their, forms, and, simple, conformations, for, it, is, nothing, more, than, the, symmetry, between, these, forms, and, conformations, the, greater, and, more, universal, species, of, harmony, are, not, however, so, wholly, obscure, and, with, them, therefore, we, must, commence, the, first, and, principal, distinction, between, them, is, this, that, some, bodies, differ, considerably, in, the, abundance, and, rarity, of, their, substance, but, correspond, in, their, conformation, others, on, the, contrary, correspond, in, the, former, and, differ, in, the, latter, thus, the, chemists, have, well, observed, that, in, their, trial, of, first, principles, sulphur, and, mercury, as, it, were, pervade, the, universe, their, reasoning, about, salt, however, is, absurd, and, merely, introduced, to, comprise, earthy, dry, fixed, bodies, in, the, other, two, indeed, one, of, the, most, universal, species, of, natural, harmony, manifests, itself, thus, there, is, a, correspondence, between, sulphur, oil, greasy, exhalations, flame, and, perhaps, the, substance, of, the, stars, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, like, correspondence, between, mercury, water, aqueous, vapor, air, and, perhaps, pure, inter-sidereal, ether, yet, do, these, two, quaternions, or, great, natural, tribes, (each, within, its, own, limits), differ, immensely, in, quantity, and, density, of, substance, while, they, generally, agree, in, conformation, as, is, manifest, in, many, instances, on, the, other, hand, the, metals, agree, in, such, quantity, and, density, (especially, when, compared, with, vegetables, etc, ), but, differ, in, many, respects, in, conformation, animals, and, vegetables, in, like, manner, vary, in, their, almost, infinite, modes, of, conformation, but, range, within, very, limited, degrees, of, quantity, and, density, of, substance, the, next, most, general, correspondence, is, that, between, individual, bodies, and, those, which, supply, them, by, way, of, menstruum, or, support, inquiry, therefore, must, be, made, as, to, the, climate, soil, and, depth, at, which, each, metal, is, generated, and, the, same, of, gems, whether, produced, in, rocks, or, mines, also, as, to, the, soil, in, which, particular, trees, shrubs, and, herbs, mostly, grow, and, as, it, were, delight, and, as, to, the, best, species, of, manure, whether, dung, chalk, sea, sand, or, ashes, etc, and, their, different, propriety, and, advantage, according, to, the, variety, of, soils, so, also, the, grafting, and, setting, of, trees, and, plants, (as, regards, the, readiness, of, grafting, one, particular, species, on, another), depends, very, much, upon, harmony, and, it, would, be, amusing, to, try, an, experiment, have, lately, heard, of, in, grafting, forest, trees, (garden, trees, alone, having, hitherto, been, adopted), by, which, means, the, leaves, and, fruit, are, enlarged, and, the, trees, produce, more, shade, the, specific, food, of, animals, again, should, be, observed, as, well, as, that, which, cannot, be, used, thus, the, carnivorous, cannot, be, fed, on, herbs, for, which, reason, the, order, of, feuilletans, the, experiment, having, been, made, has, nearly, vanished, human, nature, being, incapable, of, supporting, their, regimen, although, the, human, will, has, more, power, over, the, bodily, frame, than, that, of, other, animals, the, different, kinds, of, putrefaction, from, which, animals, are, generated, should, be, noted, the, harmony, of, principal, bodies, with, those, subordinate, to, them, (such, indeed, may, be, deemed, those, we, have, alluded, to, above), are, sufficiently, manifest, to, which, may, be, added, those, that, exist, between, different, bodies, and, their, objects, and, since, these, latter, are, more, apparent, they, may, throw, great, light, when, well, observed, and, diligently, examined, upon, those, which, are, more, latent, the, more, internal, harmony, and, aversion, or, friendship, and, enmity, (for, superstition, and, folly, have, rendered, the, terms, of, sympathy, and, antipathy, almost, disgusting), have, been, either, falsely, assigned, or, mixed, with, fable, or, most, rarely, discovered, from, neglect, for, if, one, were, to, allege, that, there, is, an, enmity, between, the, vine, and, the, cabbage, because, they, will, not, come, up, well, when, sown, together, there, is, a, sufficient, reason, for, it, in, the, succulent, and, absorbent, nature, of, each, plant, so, that, the, one, defrauds, the, other, again, if, one, were, to, say, that, there, is, a, harmony, and, friendship, between, the, corn, and, the, corn-flower, or, the, wild, poppy, because, the, latter, seldom, grow, anywhere, but, in, cultivated, soils, he, ought, rather, to, say, there, is, an, enmity, between, them, for, the, poppy, and, the, corn-flower, are, produced, and, created, by, those, juices, which, the, corn, has, left, and, rejected, so, that, the, sowing, of, the, corn, prepares, the, ground, for, their, production, and, there, are, a, vast, number, of, similar, false, assertions, as, for, fables, they, must, be, totally, exterminated, there, remains, then, but, a, scanty, supply, of, such, species, of, harmony, as, has, borne, the, test, of, experiment, such, as, that, between, the, magnet, and, iron, gold, and, quicksilver, and, the, like, in, chemical, experiments, on, metals, however, there, are, some, others, worthy, of, notice, but, the, greatest, abundance, (where, the, whole, are, so, few, in, numbers), is, discovered, in, certain, medicines, which, from, their, occult, and, specific, qualities, (as, they, are, termed), affect, particular, limbs, humors, diseases, or, constitutions, nor, should, we, omit, the, harmony, between, the, motion, and, phenomena, of, the, moon, and, their, effects, on, lower, bodies, which, may, be, brought, together, by, an, accurate, and, honest, selection, from, the, experiments, of, agriculture, navigation, and, medicine, or, of, other, sciences, by, as, much, as, these, general, instances, however, of, more, latent, harmony, are, rare, with, so, much, the, more, diligence, are, they, to, be, inquired, after, through, tradition, and, faithful, and, honest, reports, but, without, rashness, and, credulity, with, an, anxious, and, as, it, were, hesitating, degree, of, reliance, there, remains, one, species, of, harmony, which, though, simple, in, its, mode, of, action, is, yet, most, valuable, in, its, use, and, must, by, no, means, be, omitted, but, rather, diligently, investigated, it, is, the, ready, or, difficult, coition, or, union, of, bodies, in, composition, or, simple, juxtaposition, for, some, bodies, readily, and, willingly, mix, and, are, incorporated, others, tardily, and, perversely, thus, powders, mix, best, with, water, chalk, and, ashes, with, oils, and, the, like, nor, are, these, instances, of, readiness, and, aversion, to, mixture, to, be, alone, collected, but, others, also, of, the, collocation, distribution, and, digestion, of, the, parts, when, mingled, and, the, predominance, after, the, mixture, is, complete, lastly, there, remains, the, seventh, and, last, of, the, seven, modes, of, action, namely, that, by, the, alternation, and, interchange, of, the, other, six, but, of, this, it, will, not, be, the, right, time, to, offer, any, examples, until, some, deeper, investigation, shall, have, taken, place, of, each, of, the, others, the, series, or, chain, of, this, alternation, in, its, mode, of, application, to, separate, effects, is, no, less, powerful, in, its, operation, than, difficult, to, be, traced, but, men, are, possessed, with, the, most, extreme, impatience, both, of, such, inquiries, and, their, practical, application, although, it, be, the, clew, of, the, labyrinth, in, all, greater, works, thus, far, of, the, generally, useful, instances, the, twenty-seventh, and, last, place, we, will, assign, to, the, magical, instances, a, term, which, we, apply, to, those, where, the, matter, or, efficient, agent, is, scanty, or, small, in, comparison, with, the, grandeur, of, the, work, or, effect, produced, so, that, even, when, common, they, appear, miraculous, some, at, first, sight, others, even, upon, more, attentive, observation, nature, however, of, herself, supplies, these, but, sparingly, what, she, will, do, when, her, whole, store, is, thrown, open, and, after, the, discovery, of, forms, processes, and, conformation, will, appear, hereafter, as, far, as, we, can, yet, conjecture, these, magic, effects, are, produced, in, three, ways, either, by, self-multiplication, as, in, fire, and, the, poisons, termed, specific, and, the, motions, transferred, and, multiplied, from, wheel, to, wheel, or, by, the, excitement, or, as, it, were, invitation, of, another, substance, as, in, the, magnet, which, excites, innumerable, needles, without, losing, or, diminishing, its, power, and, again, in, leaven, and, the, like, or, by, the, excess, of, rapidity, of, one, species, of, motion, over, another, as, has, been, observed, in, the, case, of, gunpowder, cannon, and, mines, the, two, former, require, an, investigation, of, harmonies, the, latter, of, a, measure, of, motion, whether, there, be, any, mode, of, changing, bodies, _per, minima_, (as, it, is, termed), and, transferring, the, delicate, conformations, of, matter, which, is, of, importance, in, all, transformations, of, bodies, so, as, to, enable, art, to, effect, in, a, short, time, that, which, nature, works, out, by, divers, expedients, is, a, point, of, which, we, have, as, yet, no, indication, but, as, we, aspire, to, the, extremest, and, highest, results, in, that, which, is, solid, and, true, so, do, we, ever, detest, and, as, far, as, in, us, lies, expel, all, that, is, empty, and, vain, let, this, suffice, as, to, the, respective, dignity, of, prerogatives, of, instances, but, it, must, be, noted, that, in, this, our, organ, we, treat, of, logic, and, not, of, philosophy, seeing, however, that, our, logic, instructs, and, informs, the, understanding, in, order, that, it, may, not, with, the, small, hooks, as, it, were, of, the, mind, catch, at, and, grasp, mere, abstractions, but, rather, actually, penetrate, nature, and, discover, the, properties, and, effects, of, bodies, and, the, determinate, laws, of, their, substance, (so, that, this, science, of, ours, springs, from, the, nature, of, things, as, well, as, from, that, of, the, mind), it, is, not, to, be, wondered, at, if, it, have, been, continually, interspersed, and, illustrated, with, natural, observations, and, experiments, as, instances, of, our, method, the, prerogative, instances, are, as, appears, from, what, has, preceded, twenty-seven, in, number, and, are, termed, solitary, instances, migrating, instances, conspicuous, instances, clandestine, instances, constitutive, instances, similar, instances, singular, instances, deviating, instances, bordering, instances, instances, of, power, accompanying, and, hostile, instances, subjunctive, instances, instances, of, alliance, instances, of, the, cross, instances, of, divorce, instances, of, the, gate, citing, instances, instances, of, the, road, supplementary, instances, lancing, instances, instances, of, the, rod, instances, of, the, course, doses, of, nature, wrestling, instances, suggesting, instances, generally, useful, instances, and, magical, instances, the, advantage, by, which, these, instances, excel, the, more, ordinary, regards, specifically, either, theory, or, practice, or, both, with, regard, to, theory, they, assist, either, the, senses, or, the, understanding, the, senses, as, in, the, five, instances, of, the, lamp, the, understanding, either, by, expediting, the, exclusive, mode, of, arriving, at, the, form, as, in, solitary, instances, or, by, confining, and, more, immediately, indicating, the, affirmative, as, in, the, migrating, conspicuous, accompanying, and, subjunctive, instances, or, by, elevating, the, understanding, and, leading, it, to, general, and, common, natures, and, that, either, immediately, as, in, the, clandestine, and, singular, instances, and, those, of, alliance, or, very, nearly, so, as, in, the, constitutive, or, still, less, so, as, in, the, similar, instances, or, by, correcting, the, understanding, of, its, habits, as, in, the, deviating, instances, or, by, leading, to, the, grand, form, or, fabric, of, the, universe, as, in, the, bordering, instances, or, by, guarding, it, from, false, forms, and, causes, as, in, those, of, the, cross, and, of, divorce, with, regard, to, practice, they, either, point, it, out, or, measure, or, elevate, it, they, point, it, out, either, by, showing, where, we, must, commence, in, order, not, to, repeat, the, labors, of, others, as, in, the, instances, of, power, or, by, inducing, us, to, aspire, to, that, which, may, be, possible, as, in, the, suggesting, instances, the, four, mathematical, instances, measure, it, the, generally, useful, and, the, magical, elevate, it, again, out, of, these, twenty-seven, instances, some, must, be, collected, immediately, without, waiting, for, a, particular, investigation, of, properties, such, are, the, similar, singular, deviating, and, bordering, instances, those, of, power, and, of, the, gate, and, suggesting, generally, useful, and, magical, instances, for, these, either, assist, and, cure, the, understanding, and, senses, or, furnish, our, general, practice, the, remainder, are, to, be, collected, when, we, finish, our, synoptical, tables, for, the, work, of, the, interpreter, upon, any, particular, nature, for, these, instances, honored, and, gifted, with, such, prerogatives, are, like, the, soul, amid, the, vulgar, crowd, of, instances, and, (as, we, from, the, first, observed), a, few, of, them, are, worth, a, multitude, of, the, others, when, therefore, we, are, forming, our, tables, they, must, be, searched, out, with, the, greatest, zeal, and, placed, in, the, table, and, since, mention, must, be, made, of, them, in, what, follows, a, treatise, upon, their, nature, has, necessarily, been, prefixed, we, must, next, however, proceed, to, the, supports, and, corrections, of, induction, and, thence, to, concretes, the, latent, process, and, latent, conformations, and, the, other, matters, which, we, have, enumerated, in, their, order, in, the, twenty-first, aphorism, in, order, that, like, good, and, faithful, guardians, we, may, yield, up, their, fortune, to, mankind, upon, the, emancipation, and, majority, of, their, understanding, from, which, must, necessarily, follow, an, improvement, of, their, estate, and, an, increase, of, their, power, over, nature, for, man, by, the, fall, lost, at, once, his, state, of, innocence, and, his, empire, over, creation, both, of, which, can, be, partially, recovered, even, in, this, life, the, first, by, religion, and, faith, the, second, by, the, arts, and, sciences, for, creation, did, not, become, entirely, and, utterly, rebellious, by, the, curse, but, in, consequence, of, the, divine, decree, “in, the, sweat, of, thy, brow, shalt, thou, eat, bread, ”, she, is, compelled, by, our, labors, (not, assuredly, by, our, disputes, or, magical, ceremonies), at, length, to, afford, mankind, in, some, degree, his, bread, that, is, to, say, to, supply, man’s, daily, wants, god, almighty, first, planted, a, garden, and, indeed, it, is, the, purest, of, human, pleasures, it, is, the, greatest, refreshment, of, the, spirits, of, man, without, which, buildings, or, palaces, are, but, gross, handy-works, and, a, man, shall, ever, see, that, when, ages, grow, to, civility, or, elegancy, men, come, to, build, stately, sooner, than, to, garden, finely, as, if, gardening, were, the, greater, perfection, do, hold, it, in, the, royal, ordering, of, gardens, there, ought, to, be, gardens, for, all, the, months, in, the, year, in, which, severally, things, of, beauty, may, be, then, in, season, for, december, and, january, or, the, latter, part, of, november, you, must, take, such, things, as, are, green, all, winter, holly, ivy, bays, juniper, cypress-trees, yew, pine-apple, trees, fir, trees, rosemary, lavender, periwinkle, (the, white, the, purple, and, the, blue), germander, flags, orange, trees, lemon, trees, and, myrtles, if, they, be, stoved, and, sweet, marjoram, warm, set, there, followeth, for, the, latter, part, of, january, and, february, the, mezereon, tree, which, then, blossoms, crocus, vernus, both, the, yellow, and, the, gray, primroses, anemonies, the, early, tulip, hyacinthus, orientalis, chamaïris, fritellaria, for, march, there, come, violets, especially, the, single, blue, which, are, the, earliest, the, yellow, daffodil, the, daisy, the, almond, tree, in, blossom, the, peach, tree, in, blossom, the, cornelian, tree, in, blossom, sweet, briar, in, april, follow, the, double, white, violet, the, wallflower, the, stock-gilliflower, the, cowslip, flower-de-luces, and, lilies, of, all, natures, rosemary-flowers, the, tulip, the, double, piony, the, pale, daffodil, the, french, honeysuckle, the, cherry, tree, in, blossom, the, damascene, and, plum, trees, in, blossom, the, white-thorn, in, leaf, the, lilach-tree, in, may, and, june, come, pinks, of, all, sorts, especially, the, blush, pink, roses, of, all, kinds, except, the, musk, which, comes, later, honeysuckles, strawberries, bugloss, columbine, the, french, marygold, flos, africanus, cherry-tree, in, fruit, ribes, figs, in, fruit, rasps, vine-flowers, lavender, in, flowers, the, sweet, satyrian, with, the, white, flower, herba, muscaria, lilium, convalium, the, apple, tree, in, blossom, in, july, come, gilliflowers, of, all, varieties, musk, roses, the, lime, tree, in, blossom, early, pears, and, plums, in, fruit, gennitings, codlins, in, august, come, plums, of, all, sorts, in, fruit, pears, apricots, berberries, filberds, musk, melons, monks-hoods, of, all, colours, in, september, comes, grapes, apples, poppies, of, all, colours, peaches, melo-cotones, nectarines, cornelians, wardens, quinces, in, october, and, the, beginning, of, november, come, services, medlars, bullaces, roses, cut, or, removed, to, come, late, holly, oaks, and, such-like, these, particulars, are, for, the, climate, of, london, but, my, meaning, is, perceived, that, you, may, have, ‘ver, perpetuum, ’, as, the, place, affords, [illustration, row, of, flowers], and, because, the, breath, of, flowers, is, far, sweeter, in, the, air, where, it, comes, and, goes, like, the, warbling, of, music, than, in, the, hand, therefore, nothing, is, more, fit, for, that, delight, than, to, know, what, be, the, flowers, and, plants, that, do, best, perfume, the, air, roses, damask, and, red, are, fast, flowers, of, their, smells, so, that, you, may, walk, by, a, whole, row, of, them, and, find, nothing, of, their, sweetness, yea, though, it, be, in, a, morning’s, dew, bays, likewise, yield, no, smell, as, they, grow, rosemary, little, nor, sweet, marjoram, that, which, above, all, others, yields, the, sweetest, smell, in, the, air, is, the, violet, especially, the, white, double, violet, which, comes, twice, a, year, about, the, middle, of, april, and, about, bartholomew-tide, next, to, that, is, the, muskrose, then, the, strawberry, leaves, dying, with, a, most, excellent, cordial, smell, then, the, flower, of, the, vines—it, is, a, little, dust, like, the, dust, of, a, bent, which, grows, upon, the, cluster, in, the, first, coming, forth, then, sweet-brier, then, wallflowers, which, are, very, delightful, to, be, set, under, a, parlour, or, lower, chamber, window, then, pinks, and, gilliflowers, especially, the, matted, pink, and, clove-gilli-flower, then, the, flowers, of, the, lime, tree, then, the, honeysuckles, so, they, be, somewhat, afar, off, of, bean, flowers, speak, not, because, they, are, field, flowers, but, those, which, perfume, the, air, most, delightfully, not, passed, by, as, the, rest, but, being, trodden, upon, and, crushed, are, three, that, is, burnet, wild, thyme, and, water, mints, therefore, you, are, to, set, whole, alleys, of, them, to, have, the, pleasure, when, you, walk, or, tread, [illustration, row, of, leaves], for, gardens, speaking, of, those, which, are, indeed, princelike, as, we, have, done, of, buildings, the, contents, ought, not, well, to, be, under, thirty, acres, of, ground, and, to, be, divided, into, three, parts, a, green, in, the, entrance, a, heath, or, desert, in, the, going, forth, and, the, main, garden, in, the, midst, besides, alleys, on, both, sides, and, like, well, that, four, acres, of, ground, be, assigned, to, the, green, six, to, the, heath, four, and, four, to, either, side, and, twelve, to, the, main, garden, the, green, hath, two, pleasures, the, one, because, nothing, is, more, pleasant, to, the, eye, than, green, grass, kept, finely, shorn, the, other, because, it, will, give, you, a, fair, alley, in, the, midst, by, which, you, may, go, in, front, upon, a, stately, hedge, which, is, to, inclose, the, garden, but, because, the, alley, will, be, long, and, in, great, heat, of, the, year, or, day, you, ought, not, to, buy, the, shade, in, the, garden, by, going, in, the, sun, through, the, green, therefore, you, are, of, either, side, the, green, to, plant, a, covert, alley, upon, carpenter’s, work, about, twelve, foot, in, height, by, which, you, may, go, in, shade, into, the, garden, as, for, the, making, of, knots, or, figures, with, divers, coloured, earths, that, they, may, lie, under, the, windows, of, the, house, on, that, side, which, the, garden, stands, they, be, but, toys, you, may, see, as, good, sights, many, times, in, tarts, the, garden, is, best, to, be, square, encompassed, on, all, the, four, sides, with, a, stately, arched, hedge, the, arches, to, be, upon, pillars, of, carpenter’s, work, of, some, ten, foot, high, and, six, foot, broad, and, the, spaces, between, of, the, same, dimension, with, the, breadth, of, the, arch, over, the, arches, let, there, be, an, entire, hedge, of, some, four, foot, high, framed, also, upon, carpenter’s, work, and, upon, the, upper, hedge, over, every, arch, a, little, turret, with, a, belly, enough, to, receive, a, cage, of, birds, and, over, every, space, between, the, arches, some, other, little, figure, with, broad, plates, of, round, coloured, glass, gilt, for, the, sun, to, play, upon, but, this, hedge, intend, to, be, raised, upon, a, bank, not, steep, but, gently, slope, of, some, six, foot, set, all, with, flowers, also, understand, that, this, square, of, the, garden, should, not, be, the, whole, breadth, of, the, ground, but, to, leave, on, either, side, ground, enough, for, diversity, of, side, alleys, into, which, the, two, covert, alleys, of, the, green, may, deliver, you, but, there, must, be, no, alleys, with, hedges, at, either, end, of, this, great, enclosure, not, at, the, hither, end, for, letting, your, prospect, upon, the, fair, hedge, from, the, green, nor, at, the, further, end, for, letting, your, prospect, from, the, hedge, through, the, arches, upon, the, heath, [illustration, row, of, flowers], for, the, ordering, of, the, ground, within, the, great, hedge, leave, it, to, variety, of, device, advising, nevertheless, that, whatsoever, form, you, cast, it, into, first, it, be, not, too, busy, or, full, of, work, wherein, for, my, part, do, not, like, images, cut, out, in, juniper, or, other, garden, stuff, they, be, for, children, little, low, hedges, round, like, welts, with, some, pretty, pyramids, like, well, and, in, some, places, fair, columns, upon, frames, of, carpenter’s, work, would, also, have, the, alleys, spacious, and, fair, you, may, have, closer, alleys, upon, the, side, grounds, but, none, in, the, main, garden, wish, also, in, the, very, middle, a, fair, mount, with, three, ascents, and, alleys, enough, for, four, to, walk, a-breast, which, would, have, to, be, perfect, circles, without, any, bulwarks, or, embossments, and, the, whole, amount, to, be, thirty, foot, high, and, some, fine, banqueting, house, with, some, chimneys, neatly, cast, and, without, too, much, glass, [illustration, row, of, leaves], for, fountains, they, are, a, great, beauty, and, refreshment, but, pools, mar, all, and, make, the, garden, unwholesome, and, full, of, flies, and, frogs, fountains, intend, to, be, of, two, natures, the, one, that, sprinkleth, or, spouteth, water, the, other, a, fair, receipt, of, water, of, some, thirty, or, forty, foot, square, but, without, fish, or, slime, or, mud, for, the, first, the, ornaments, of, images, gilt, or, of, marble, which, are, in, use, do, well, but, the, main, matter, is, so, to, convey, the, water, as, it, never, stay, either, in, the, bowls, or, in, the, cistern, that, the, water, be, never, by, rest, discoloured, green, or, red, or, the, like, or, gather, any, mossiness, or, putrefaction, besides, that, it, is, to, be, cleansed, every, day, by, the, hand, also, some, steps, up, to, it, and, some, fine, pavement, about, it, doth, well, as, for, the, other, kind, of, fountain, which, we, may, call, a, bathing, pool, it, may, admit, much, curiosity, and, beauty, wherewith, we, will, not, trouble, ourselves, as, that, the, bottom, be, finely, paved, and, with, images, the, sides, likewise, and, withal, embellished, with, coloured, glass, and, such, things, of, lustre, encompassed, also, with, fine, rails, of, low, statues, but, the, main, point, is, the, same, which, we, mentioned, in, the, former, kind, of, fountain, which, is, that, the, water, be, in, perpetual, motion, fed, by, a, water, higher, than, the, pool, and, delivered, into, it, by, fair, spouts, and, then, discharged, away, under, ground, by, some, equality, of, bores, that, it, stay, little, and, for, fine, devices, of, arching, water, without, spilling, and, making, it, rise, in, several, forms, of, feathers, drinking, glasses, canopies, and, the, like, they, be, pretty, things, to, look, on, but, nothing, to, health, and, sweetness, [illustration, row, of, flowers], for, the, health, which, was, the, third, part, of, our, plot, wish, it, to, be, framed, as, much, as, may, be, to, a, natural, wildness, trees, would, have, none, in, it, but, some, thickets, made, only, of, sweet-brier, and, honeysuckle, and, some, wild, vine, amongst, and, the, ground, set, with, violets, strawberries, and, primroses, for, these, are, sweet, and, prosper, in, the, shade, and, these, to, be, in, the, heath, here, &, there, not, in, any, order, like, also, little, heaps, in, the, nature, of, mole-hills, such, as, are, in, wild, heaths, to, be, set, some, with, wild, thyme, some, with, pinks, some, with, germander, that, gives, a, good, flower, to, the, eye, some, with, periwinkle, some, with, violets, some, with, strawberries, some, with, cowslips, some, with, daisies, some, with, red, roses, some, with, lilium, convallium, some, with, sweet-williams, red, some, with, bears-foot, and, the, like, low, flowers, being, withal, sweet, and, sightly, part, of, which, heaps, to, be, with, standards, of, little, bushes, pricked, upon, their, top, and, part, without, the, standards, to, be, roses, juniper, holly, berberries, but, here, and, there, because, of, the, smell, of, their, blossom, red, currants, gooseberries, rosemary, bays, sweet-brier, and, such-like, but, these, standards, to, be, kept, with, cutting, that, they, may, not, grow, out, of, course, [illustration, row, of, flowers], for, the, side, grounds, you, are, to, fill, them, with, variety, of, alleys, private, to, give, a, full, shade, some, of, them, wheresoever, the, sun, be, you, are, to, frame, some, of, them, likewise, for, shelter, that, when, the, wind, blows, sharp, you, may, walk, as, in, a, gallery, and, those, alleys, must, be, likewise, hedged, at, both, ends, to, keep, out, the, wind, and, these, closer, alleys, must, be, ever, finely, gravelled, and, no, grass, because, of, going, wet, in, many, of, these, alleys, likewise, you, are, to, set, fruit, trees, of, all, sorts, as, well, upon, the, walls, as, in, ranges, and, this, would, be, generally, observed, that, the, borders, wherein, you, plant, your, fruit, trees, be, fair, and, large, and, low, and, not, steep, and, set, with, fine, flowers, but, thin, and, sparingly, lest, they, deceive, the, trees, at, the, end, of, both, the, side, grounds, would, have, a, mount, of, some, pretty, height, leaving, the, wall, of, the, inclosure, breast, high, to, look, abroad, into, the, fields, [illustration, row, of, leaves], for, the, main, garden, do, not, deny, but, there, should, be, some, fair, alleys, ranged, on, both, sides, with, fruit, trees, and, some, pretty, tufts, of, fruit, trees, and, arbours, with, seats, set, in, some, decent, order, but, these, to, be, by, no, means, set, too, thick, but, to, leave, the, main, garden, so, as, it, be, not, close, but, the, air, open, and, free, for, as, for, shade, would, have, you, rest, upon, the, alleys, of, the, side, grounds, there, to, walk, if, you, be, disposed, in, the, heat, of, the, year, or, day, but, to, make, account, that, the, main, garden, is, for, the, more, temperate, parts, of, the, year, and, in, the, heat, of, summer, for, the, morning, and, the, evening, or, overcast, days, [illustration, flock, of, birds], for, aviaries, like, them, not, except, they, be, of, that, largeness, as, they, may, be, turfed, and, have, living, plants, and, bushes, set, in, them, that, the, birds, may, have, more, scope, and, natural, nestling, and, that, no, foulness, appear, in, the, floor, of, the, aviary, [illustration, row, of, leaves], so, have, made, a, platform, of, a, princely, garden, partly, by, precept, partly, by, drawing, not, a, model, but, some, general, lines, of, it, and, in, this, have, spared, for, no, cost, but, it, is, nothing, for, great, princes, that, for, the, most, part, taking, advice, with, workmen, with, no, less, cost, set, their, things, together, and, sometimes, add, statues, and, such, things, for, state, and, magnificence, but, nothing, to, the, true, pleasure, of, a, garden, _to, the, king_, were, under, the, law, excellent, king, both, daily, sacrifices, and, freewill, offerings, the, one, proceeding, upon, ordinary, observance, the, other, upon, a, devout, cheerfulness, in, like, manner, there, belongeth, to, kings, from, their, servants, both, tribute, of, duty, and, presents, of, affection, in, the, former, of, these, hope, shall, not, live, to, be, wanting, according, to, my, most, humble, duty, and, the, good, pleasure, of, your, majesty’s, employments, for, the, latter, thought, it, more, respective, to, make, choice, of, some, oblation, which, might, rather, refer, to, the, propriety, and, excellency, of, your, individual, person, than, to, the, business, of, your, crown, and, state, wherefore, representing, your, majesty, many, times, unto, my, mind, and, beholding, you, not, with, the, inquisitive, eye, of, presumption, to, discover, that, which, the, scripture, telleth, me, is, inscrutable, but, with, the, observant, eye, of, duty, and, admiration, leaving, aside, the, other, parts, of, your, virtue, and, fortune, have, been, touched—yea, and, possessed—with, an, extreme, wonder, at, those, your, virtues, and, faculties, which, the, philosophers, call, intellectual, the, largeness, of, your, capacity, the, faithfulness, of, your, memory, the, swiftness, of, your, apprehension, the, penetration, of, your, judgment, and, the, facility, and, order, of, your, elocution, and, have, often, thought, that, of, all, the, persons, living, that, have, known, your, majesty, were, the, best, instance, to, make, a, man, of, plato’s, opinion, that, all, knowledge, is, but, remembrance, and, that, the, mind, of, man, by, nature, knoweth, all, things, and, hath, but, her, own, native, and, original, notions, (which, by, the, strangeness, and, darkness, of, this, tabernacle, of, the, body, are, sequestered), again, revived, and, restored, such, a, light, of, nature, have, observed, in, your, majesty, and, such, a, readiness, to, take, flame, and, blaze, from, the, least, occasion, presented, or, the, least, spark, of, another’s, knowledge, delivered, and, as, the, scripture, saith, of, the, wisest, king, “that, his, heart, was, as, the, sands, of, the, sea, ”, which, though, it, be, one, of, the, largest, bodies, yet, it, consisteth, of, the, smallest, and, finest, portions, so, hath, god, given, your, majesty, a, composition, of, understanding, admirable, being, able, to, compass, and, comprehend, the, greatest, matters, and, nevertheless, to, touch, and, apprehend, the, least, whereas, it, should, seem, an, impossibility, in, nature, for, the, same, instrument, to, make, itself, fit, for, great, and, small, works, and, for, your, gift, of, speech, call, to, mind, what, cornelius, tacitus, saith, of, augustus, cæsar, _augusto, profluens_, _et, quæ, principem, deceret_, _eloquentia, fuit_, for, if, we, note, it, well, speech, that, is, uttered, with, labour, and, difficulty, or, speech, that, savoureth, of, the, affectation, of, art, and, precepts, or, speech, that, is, framed, after, the, imitation, of, some, pattern, of, eloquence, though, never, so, excellent, all, this, hath, somewhat, servile, and, holding, of, the, subject, but, your, majesty’s, manner, of, speech, is, indeed, prince-like, flowing, as, from, a, fountain, and, yet, streaming, and, branching, itself, into, nature’s, order, full, of, facility, and, felicity, imitating, none, and, inimitable, by, any, and, as, in, your, civil, estate, there, appeareth, to, be, an, emulation, and, contention, of, your, majesty’s, virtue, with, your, fortune, a, virtuous, disposition, with, a, fortunate, regiment, a, virtuous, expectation, (when, time, was), of, your, greater, fortune, with, a, prosperous, possession, thereof, in, the, due, time, a, virtuous, observation, of, the, laws, of, marriage, with, most, blessed, and, happy, fruit, of, marriage, a, virtuous, and, most, christian, desire, of, peace, with, a, fortunate, inclination, in, your, neighbour, princes, thereunto, so, likewise, in, these, intellectual, matters, there, seemeth, to, be, no, less, contention, between, the, excellency, of, your, majesty’s, gifts, of, nature, and, the, universality, and, perfection, of, your, learning, for, am, well, assured, that, this, which, shall, say, is, no, amplification, at, all, but, a, positive, and, measured, truth, which, is, that, there, hath, not, been, since, christ’s, time, any, king, or, temporal, monarch, which, hath, been, so, learned, in, all, literature, and, erudition, divine, and, human, for, let, a, man, seriously, and, diligently, revolve, and, peruse, the, succession, of, the, emperors, of, rome, of, which, cæsar, the, dictator, (who, lived, some, years, before, christ), and, marcus, antoninus, were, the, best, learned, and, so, descend, to, the, emperors, of, græcia, or, of, the, west, and, then, to, the, lines, of, france, spain, england, scotland, and, the, rest, and, he, shall, find, this, judgment, is, truly, made, for, it, seemeth, much, in, a, king, if, by, the, compendious, extractions, of, other, men’s, wits, and, labours, he, can, take, hold, of, any, superficial, ornaments, and, shows, of, learning, or, if, he, countenance, and, prefer, learning, and, learned, men, but, to, drink, indeed, of, the, true, fountains, of, learning—nay, to, have, such, a, fountain, of, learning, in, himself, in, a, king, and, in, a, king, born—is, almost, a, miracle, and, the, more, because, there, is, met, in, your, majesty, a, rare, conjunction, as, well, of, divine, and, sacred, literature, as, of, profane, and, human, so, as, your, majesty, standeth, invested, of, that, triplicity, which, in, great, veneration, was, ascribed, to, the, ancient, hermes, the, power, and, fortune, of, a, king, the, knowledge, and, illumination, of, a, priest, and, the, learning, and, universality, of, a, philosopher, this, propriety, inherent, and, individual, attribute, in, your, majesty, deserveth, to, be, expressed, not, only, in, the, fame, and, admiration, of, the, present, time, nor, in, the, history, or, tradition, of, the, ages, succeeding, but, also, in, some, solid, work, fixed, memorial, and, immortal, monument, bearing, a, character, or, signature, both, of, the, power, of, a, king, and, the, difference, and, perfection, of, such, a, king, therefore, did, conclude, with, myself, that, could, not, make, unto, your, majesty, a, better, oblation, than, of, some, treatise, tending, to, that, end, whereof, the, sum, will, consist, of, these, two, parts, the, former, concerning, the, excellency, of, learning, and, knowledge, and, the, excellency, of, the, merit, and, true, glory, in, the, augmentation, and, propagation, thereof, the, latter, what, the, particular, acts, and, works, are, which, have, been, embraced, and, undertaken, for, the, advancement, of, learning, and, again, what, defects, and, undervalues, find, in, such, particular, acts, to, the, end, that, though, cannot, positively, or, affirmatively, advise, your, majesty, or, propound, unto, you, framed, particulars, yet, may, excite, your, princely, cogitations, to, visit, the, excellent, treasure, of, your, own, mind, and, thence, to, extract, particulars, for, this, purpose, agreeable, to, your, magnanimity, and, wisdom, (1), in, the, entrance, to, the, former, of, these—to, clear, the, way, and, as, it, were, to, make, silence, to, have, the, true, testimonies, concerning, the, dignity, of, learning, to, be, better, heard, without, the, interruption, of, tacit, objections—i, think, good, to, deliver, it, from, the, discredits, and, disgraces, which, it, hath, received, all, from, ignorance, but, ignorance, severally, disguised, appearing, sometimes, in, the, zeal, and, jealousy, of, divines, sometimes, in, the, severity, and, arrogancy, of, politics, and, sometimes, in, the, errors, and, imperfections, of, learned, men, themselves, (2), hear, the, former, sort, say, that, knowledge, is, of, those, things, which, are, to, be, accepted, of, with, great, limitation, and, caution, that, the, aspiring, to, overmuch, knowledge, was, the, original, temptation, and, sin, whereupon, ensued, the, fall, of, man, that, knowledge, hath, in, it, somewhat, of, the, serpent, and, therefore, where, it, entereth, into, a, man, it, makes, him, swell, _scientia, inflat_, that, solomon, gives, a, censure, “that, there, is, no, end, of, making, books, and, that, much, reading, is, weariness, of, the, flesh, ”, and, again, in, another, place, “that, in, spacious, knowledge, there, is, much, contristation, and, that, he, that, increaseth, knowledge, increaseth, anxiety, ”, that, saint, paul, gives, a, caveat, “that, we, be, not, spoiled, through, vain, philosophy, ”, that, experience, demonstrates, how, learned, men, have, been, arch-heretics, how, learned, times, have, been, inclined, to, atheism, and, how, the, contemplation, of, second, causes, doth, derogate, from, our, dependence, upon, god, who, is, the, first, cause, (3), to, discover, then, the, ignorance, and, error, of, this, opinion, and, the, misunderstanding, in, the, grounds, thereof, it, may, well, appear, these, men, do, not, observe, or, consider, that, it, was, not, the, pure, knowledge, of, nature, and, universality, a, knowledge, by, the, light, whereof, man, did, give, names, unto, other, creatures, in, paradise, as, they, were, brought, before, him, according, unto, their, proprieties, which, gave, the, occasion, to, the, fall, but, it, was, the, proud, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, with, an, intent, in, man, to, give, law, unto, himself, and, to, depend, no, more, upon, god’s, commandments, which, was, the, form, of, the, temptation, neither, is, it, any, quantity, of, knowledge, how, great, soever, that, can, make, the, mind, of, man, to, swell, for, nothing, can, fill, much, less, extend, the, soul, of, man, but, god, and, the, contemplation, of, god, and, therefore, solomon, speaking, of, the, two, principal, senses, of, inquisition, the, eye, and, the, ear, affirmeth, that, the, eye, is, never, satisfied, with, seeing, nor, the, ear, with, hearing, and, if, there, be, no, fulness, then, is, the, continent, greater, than, the, content, so, of, knowledge, itself, and, the, mind, of, man, whereto, the, senses, are, but, reporters, he, defineth, likewise, in, these, words, placed, after, that, calendar, or, ephemerides, which, he, maketh, of, the, diversities, of, times, and, seasons, for, all, actions, and, purposes, and, concludeth, thus, “god, hath, made, all, things, beautiful, or, decent, in, the, true, return, of, their, seasons, also, he, hath, placed, the, world, in, man’s, heart, yet, cannot, man, find, out, the, work, which, god, worketh, from, the, beginning, to, the, end”—declaring, not, obscurely, that, god, hath, framed, the, mind, of, man, as, a, mirror, or, glass, capable, of, the, image, of, the, universal, world, and, joyful, to, receive, the, impression, thereof, as, the, eye, joyeth, to, receive, light, and, not, only, delighted, in, beholding, the, variety, of, things, and, vicissitude, of, times, but, raised, also, to, find, out, and, discern, the, ordinances, and, decrees, which, throughout, all, those, changes, are, infallibly, observed, and, although, he, doth, insinuate, that, the, supreme, or, summary, law, of, nature, (which, he, calleth, “the, work, which, god, worketh, from, the, beginning, to, the, end”), is, not, possible, to, be, found, out, by, man, yet, that, doth, not, derogate, from, the, capacity, of, the, mind, but, may, be, referred, to, the, impediments, as, of, shortness, of, life, ill, conjunction, of, labours, ill, tradition, of, knowledge, over, from, hand, to, hand, and, many, other, inconveniences, whereunto, the, condition, of, man, is, subject, for, that, nothing, parcel, of, the, world, is, denied, to, man’s, inquiry, and, invention, he, doth, in, another, place, rule, over, when, he, saith, “the, spirit, of, man, is, as, the, lamp, of, god, wherewith, he, searcheth, the, inwardness, of, all, secrets, ”, if, then, such, be, the, capacity, and, receipt, of, the, mind, of, man, it, is, manifest, that, there, is, no, danger, at, all, in, the, proportion, or, quantity, of, knowledge, how, large, soever, lest, it, should, make, it, swell, or, out-compass, itself, no, but, it, is, merely, the, quality, of, knowledge, which, be, it, in, quantity, more, or, less, if, it, be, taken, without, the, true, corrective, thereof, hath, in, it, some, nature, of, venom, or, malignity, and, some, effects, of, that, venom, which, is, ventosity, or, swelling, this, corrective, spice, the, mixture, whereof, maketh, knowledge, so, sovereign, is, charity, which, the, apostle, immediately, addeth, to, the, former, clause, for, so, he, saith, “knowledge, bloweth, up, but, charity, buildeth, up, ”, not, unlike, unto, that, which, he, deilvereth, in, another, place, “if, spake, ”, saith, he, “with, the, tongues, of, men, and, angels, and, had, not, charity, it, were, but, as, a, tinkling, cymbal, ”, not, but, that, it, is, an, excellent, thing, to, speak, with, the, tongues, of, men, and, angels, but, because, if, it, be, severed, from, charity, and, not, referred, to, the, good, of, men, and, mankind, it, hath, rather, a, sounding, and, unworthy, glory, than, a, meriting, and, substantial, virtue, and, as, for, that, censure, of, solomon, concerning, the, excess, of, writing, and, reading, books, and, the, anxiety, of, spirit, which, redoundeth, from, knowledge, and, that, admonition, of, st, paul, “that, we, be, not, seduced, by, vain, philosophy, ”, let, those, places, be, rightly, understood, and, they, do, indeed, excellently, set, forth, the, true, bounds, and, limitations, whereby, human, knowledge, is, confined, and, circumscribed, and, yet, without, any, such, contracting, or, coarctation, but, that, it, may, comprehend, all, the, universal, nature, of, things, for, these, limitations, are, three, the, first, “that, we, do, not, so, place, our, felicity, in, knowledge, as, we, forget, our, mortality, ”, the, second, “that, we, make, application, of, our, knowledge, to, give, ourselves, repose, and, contentment, and, not, distaste, or, repining, ”, the, third, “that, we, do, not, presume, by, the, contemplation, of, nature, to, attain, to, the, mysteries, of, god, ”, for, as, touching, the, first, of, these, solomon, doth, excellently, expound, himself, in, another, place, of, the, same, book, where, he, saith, saw, well, that, knowledge, recedeth, as, far, from, ignorance, as, light, doth, from, darkness, and, that, the, wise, man’s, eyes, keep, watch, in, his, head, whereas, this, fool, roundeth, about, in, darkness, but, withal, learned, that, the, same, mortality, involveth, them, both, ”, and, for, the, second, certain, it, is, there, is, no, vexation, or, anxiety, of, mind, which, resulteth, from, knowledge, otherwise, than, merely, by, accident, for, all, knowledge, and, wonder, (which, is, the, seed, of, knowledge), is, an, impression, of, pleasure, in, itself, but, when, men, fall, to, framing, conclusions, out, of, their, knowledge, applying, it, to, their, particular, and, ministering, to, themselves, thereby, weak, fears, or, vast, desires, there, groweth, that, carefulness, and, trouble, of, mind, which, is, spoken, of, for, then, knowledge, is, no, more, _lumen, siccum_, whereof, heraclitus, the, profound, said, _lumen, siccum, optima, anima_, but, it, becometh, _lumen, madidum_, or, _maceratum_, being, steeped, and, infused, in, the, humours, of, the, affections, and, as, for, the, third, point, it, deserveth, to, be, a, little, stood, upon, and, not, to, be, lightly, passed, over, for, if, any, man, shall, think, by, view, and, inquiry, into, these, sensible, and, material, things, to, attain, that, light, whereby, he, may, reveal, unto, himself, the, nature, or, will, of, god, then, indeed, is, he, spoiled, by, vain, philosophy, for, the, contemplation, of, god’s, creatures, and, works, produceth, (having, regard, to, the, works, and, creatures, themselves), knowledge, but, having, regard, to, god, no, perfect, knowledge, but, wonder, which, is, broken, knowledge, and, therefore, it, was, most, aptly, said, by, one, of, plato’s, school, “that, the, sense, of, man, carrieth, a, resemblance, with, the, sun, which, (as, we, see), openeth, and, revealeth, all, the, terrestrial, globe, but, then, again, it, obscureth, and, concealeth, the, stars, and, celestial, globe, so, doth, the, sense, discover, natural, things, but, it, darkeneth, and, shutteth, up, divine, ”, and, hence, it, is, true, that, it, hath, proceeded, that, divers, great, learned, men, have, been, heretical, whilst, they, have, sought, to, fly, up, to, the, secrets, of, the, deity, by, this, waxen, wings, of, the, senses, and, as, for, the, conceit, that, too, much, knowledge, should, incline, a, man, to, atheism, and, that, the, ignorance, of, second, causes, should, make, a, more, devout, dependence, upon, god, which, is, the, first, cause, first, it, is, good, to, ask, the, question, which, job, asked, of, his, friends, “will, you, lie, for, god, as, one, man, will, lie, for, another, to, gratify, him, ”, for, certain, it, is, that, god, worketh, nothing, in, nature, but, by, second, causes, and, if, they, would, have, it, otherwise, believed, it, is, mere, imposture, as, it, were, in, favour, towards, god, and, nothing, else, but, to, offer, to, the, author, of, truth, the, unclean, sacrifice, of, a, lie, but, further, it, is, an, assured, truth, and, a, conclusion, of, experience, that, a, little, or, superficial, knowledge, of, philosophy, may, incline, the, mind, of, men, to, atheism, but, a, further, proceeding, therein, doth, bring, the, mind, back, again, to, religion, for, in, the, entrance, of, philosophy, when, the, second, causes, which, are, next, unto, the, senses, do, offer, themselves, to, the, mind, of, man, if, it, dwell, and, stay, there, it, may, induce, some, oblivion, of, the, highest, cause, but, when, a, man, passeth, on, further, and, seeth, the, dependence, of, causes, and, the, works, of, providence, then, according, to, the, allegory, of, the, poets, he, will, easily, believe, that, the, highest, link, of, nature’s, chain, must, needs, he, tied, to, the, foot, of, jupiter’s, chair, to, conclude, therefore, let, no, man, upon, a, weak, conceit, of, sobriety, or, an, ill-applied, moderation, think, or, maintain, that, a, man, can, search, too, far, or, be, too, well, studied, in, the, book, of, god’s, word, or, in, the, book, of, god’s, works, divinity, or, philosophy, but, rather, let, men, endeavour, an, endless, progress, or, proficience, in, both, only, let, men, beware, that, they, apply, both, to, charity, and, not, to, swelling, to, use, and, not, to, ostentation, and, again, that, they, do, not, unwisely, mingle, or, confound, these, learnings, together, (1), and, as, for, the, disgraces, which, learning, receiveth, from, politics, they, be, of, this, nature, that, learning, doth, soften, men’s, minds, and, makes, them, more, unapt, for, the, honour, and, exercise, of, arms, that, it, doth, mar, and, pervert, men’s, dispositions, for, matter, of, government, and, policy, in, making, them, too, curious, and, irresolute, by, variety, of, reading, or, too, peremptory, or, positive, by, strictness, of, rules, and, axioms, or, too, immoderate, and, overweening, by, reason, of, the, greatness, of, examples, or, too, incompatible, and, differing, from, the, times, by, reason, of, the, dissimilitude, of, examples, or, at, least, that, it, doth, divert, men’s, travails, from, action, and, business, and, bringeth, them, to, a, love, of, leisure, and, privateness, and, that, it, doth, bring, into, states, a, relaxation, of, discipline, whilst, every, man, is, more, ready, to, argue, than, to, obey, and, execute, out, of, this, conceit, cato, surnamed, the, censor, one, of, the, wisest, men, indeed, that, ever, lived, when, carneades, the, philosopher, came, in, embassage, to, rome, and, that, the, young, men, of, rome, began, to, flock, about, him, being, allured, with, the, sweetness, and, majesty, of, his, eloquence, and, learning, gave, counsel, in, open, senate, that, they, should, give, him, his, despatch, with, all, speed, lest, he, should, infect, and, enchant, the, minds, and, affections, of, the, youth, and, at, unawares, bring, in, an, alteration, of, the, manners, and, customs, of, the, state, out, of, the, same, conceit, or, humour, did, virgil, turning, his, pen, to, the, advantage, of, his, country, and, the, disadvantage, of, his, own, profession, make, a, kind, of, separation, between, policy, and, government, and, between, arts, and, sciences, in, the, verses, so, much, renowned, attributing, and, challenging, the, one, to, the, romans, and, leaving, and, yielding, the, other, to, the, grecians, _tu, regere, imperio, popules_, _romane_, _memento_, _hæ, tibi, erunt, artes_, &c, so, likewise, we, see, that, anytus, the, accuser, of, socrates, laid, it, as, an, article, of, charge, and, accusation, against, him, that, he, did, with, the, variety, and, power, of, his, discourses, and, disputatious, withdraw, young, men, from, due, reverence, to, the, laws, and, customs, of, their, country, and, that, he, did, profess, a, dangerous, and, pernicious, science, which, was, to, make, the, worse, matter, seem, the, better, and, to, suppress, truth, by, force, of, eloquence, and, speech, (2), but, these, and, the, like, imputations, have, rather, a, countenance, of, gravity, than, any, ground, of, justice, for, experience, doth, warrant, that, both, in, persons, and, in, times, there, hath, been, a, meeting, and, concurrence, in, learning, and, arms, flourishing, and, excelling, in, the, same, men, and, the, same, ages, for, as, ‘for, men, there, cannot, be, a, better, nor, the, hike, instance, as, of, that, pair, alexander, the, great, and, julius, cæsar, the, dictator, whereof, the, one, was, aristotle’s, scholar, in, philosophy, and, the, other, was, cicero’s, rival, in, eloquence, or, if, any, man, had, rather, call, for, scholars, that, were, great, generals, than, generals, that, were, great, scholars, let, him, take, epaminondas, the, theban, or, xenophon, the, athenian, whereof, the, one, was, the, first, that, abated, the, power, of, sparta, and, the, other, was, the, first, that, made, way, to, the, overthrow, of, the, monarchy, of, persia, and, this, concurrence, is, yet, more, visible, in, times, than, in, persons, by, how, much, an, age, is, greater, object, than, a, man, for, both, in, egypt, assyria, persia, græcia, and, rome, the, same, times, that, are, most, renowned, for, arms, are, likewise, most, admired, for, learning, so, that, the, greatest, authors, and, philosophers, and, the, greatest, captains, and, governors, have, lived, in, the, same, ages, neither, can, it, otherwise, he, for, as, in, man, the, ripeness, of, strength, of, the, body, and, mind, cometh, much, about, an, age, save, that, the, strength, of, the, body, cometh, somewhat, the, more, early, so, in, states, arms, and, learning, whereof, the, one, correspondeth, to, the, body, the, other, to, the, soul, of, man, have, a, concurrence, or, near, sequence, in, times, (3), and, for, matter, of, policy, and, government, that, learning, should, rather, hurt, than, enable, thereunto, is, a, thing, very, improbable, we, see, it, is, accounted, an, error, to, commit, a, natural, body, to, empiric, physicians, which, commonly, have, a, few, pleasing, receipts, whereupon, they, are, confident, and, adventurous, but, know, neither, the, causes, of, diseases, nor, the, complexions, of, patients, nor, peril, of, accidents, nor, the, true, method, of, cures, we, see, it, is, a, like, error, to, rely, upon, advocates, or, lawyers, which, are, only, men, of, practice, and, not, grounded, in, their, books, who, are, many, times, easily, surprised, when, matter, falleth, out, besides, their, experience, to, the, prejudice, of, the, causes, they, handle, so, by, like, reason, it, cannot, be, but, a, matter, of, doubtful, consequence, if, states, be, managed, by, empiric, statesmen, not, well, mingled, with, men, grounded, in, learning, but, contrariwise, it, is, almost, without, instance, contradictory, that, ever, any, government, was, disastrous, that, was, in, the, hands, of, learned, governors, for, howsoever, it, hath, been, ordinary, with, politic, men, to, extenuate, and, disable, learned, men, by, the, names, of, _pedantes_, yet, in, the, records, of, time, it, appeareth, in, many, particulars, that, the, governments, of, princes, in, minority, (notwithstanding, the, infinite, disadvantage, of, that, kind, of, state)—have, nevertheless, excelled, the, government, of, princes, of, mature, age, even, for, that, reason, which, they, seek, to, traduce, which, is, that, by, that, occasion, the, state, hath, been, in, the, hands, of, _pedantes_, for, so, was, the, state, of, rome, for, the, first, five, years, which, are, so, much, magnified, during, the, minority, of, nero, in, the, hands, of, seneca, a, _pedenti_, so, it, was, again, for, ten, years’, space, or, more, during, the, minority, of, gordianus, the, younger, with, great, applause, and, contentation, in, the, hands, of, misitheus, a, _pedanti_, so, was, it, before, that, in, the, minority, of, alexander, severus, in, like, happiness, in, hands, not, much, unlike, by, reason, of, the, rule, of, the, women, who, were, aided, by, the, teachers, and, preceptors, nay, let, a, man, look, into, the, government, of, the, bishops, of, rome, as, by, name, into, the, government, of, pius, quintus, and, sextus, quintus, in, our, times, who, were, both, at, their, entrance, esteemed, but, as, pedantical, friars, and, he, shall, find, that, such, popes, do, greater, things, and, proceed, upon, truer, principles, of, state, than, those, which, have, ascended, to, the, papacy, from, an, education, and, breeding, in, affairs, of, state, and, courts, of, princes, for, although, men, bred, in, learning, are, perhaps, to, seek, in, points, of, convenience, and, accommodating, for, the, present, which, the, italians, call, _ragioni, di, stato_, whereof, the, same, pius, quintus, could, not, hear, spoken, with, patience, terming, them, inventions, against, religion, and, the, moral, virtues, yet, on, the, other, side, to, recompense, that, they, are, perfect, in, those, same, plain, grounds, of, religion, justice, honour, and, moral, virtue, which, if, they, be, well, and, watchfully, pursued, there, will, be, seldom, use, of, those, other, no, more, than, of, physic, in, a, sound, or, well-dieted, body, neither, can, the, experience, of, one, man’s, life, furnish, examples, and, precedents, for, the, event, of, one, man’s, life, for, as, it, happeneth, sometimes, that, the, grandchild, or, other, descendant, resembleth, the, ancestor, more, than, the, son, so, many, times, occurrences, of, present, times, may, sort, better, with, ancient, examples, than, with, those, of, the, later, or, immediate, times, and, lastly, the, wit, of, one, man, can, no, more, countervail, learning, than, one, man’s, means, can, hold, way, with, a, common, purse, (4), and, as, for, those, particular, seducements, or, indispositions, of, the, mind, for, policy, and, government, which, learning, is, pretended, to, insinuate, if, it, be, granted, that, any, such, thing, be, it, must, be, remembered, withal, that, learning, ministereth, in, every, of, them, greater, strength, of, medicine, or, remedy, than, it, offereth, cause, of, indisposition, or, infirmity, for, if, by, a, secret, operation, it, make, men, perplexed, and, irresolute, on, the, other, side, by, plain, precept, it, teacheth, them, when, and, upon, what, ground, to, resolve, yea, and, how, to, carry, things, in, suspense, without, prejudice, till, they, resolve, if, it, make, men, positive, and, regular, it, teacheth, them, what, things, are, in, their, nature, demonstrative, and, what, are, conjectural, and, as, well, the, use, of, distinctions, and, exceptions, as, the, latitude, of, principles, and, rules, if, it, mislead, by, disproportion, or, dissimilitude, of, examples, it, teacheth, men, the, force, of, circumstances, the, errors, of, comparisons, and, all, the, cautions, of, application, so, that, in, all, these, it, doth, rectify, more, effectually, than, it, can, pervert, and, these, medicines, it, conveyeth, into, men’s, minds, much, more, forcibly, by, the, quickness, and, penetration, of, examples, for, let, a, man, look, into, the, errors, of, clement, so, lively, described, by, guicciardini, who, served, under, him, or, into, the, errors, of, cicero, painted, out, by, his, own, pencil, in, his, epistles, to, atticus, and, he, will, fly, apace, from, being, irresolute, let, him, look, into, the, errors, of, phocion, and, he, will, beware, how, he, be, obstinate, or, inflexible, let, him, but, read, the, fable, of, ixion, and, it, will, hold, him, from, being, vaporous, or, imaginative, let, him, look, into, the, errors, of, cato, and, he, will, never, be, one, of, the, antipodes, to, tread, opposite, to, the, present, world, (5), and, for, the, conceit, that, learning, should, dispose, men, to, leisure, and, privateness, and, make, men, slothful, it, were, a, strange, thing, if, that, which, accustometh, the, mind, to, a, perpetual, motion, and, agitation, should, induce, slothfulness, whereas, contrariwise, it, may, be, truly, affirmed, that, no, kind, of, men, love, business, for, itself, but, those, that, are, learned, for, other, persons, love, it, for, profit, as, a, hireling, that, loves, the, work, for, the, wages, or, for, honour, as, because, it, beareth, them, up, in, the, eyes, of, men, and, refresheth, their, reputation, which, otherwise, would, wear, or, because, it, putteth, them, in, mind, of, their, fortune, and, giveth, them, occasion, to, pleasure, and, displeasure, or, because, it, exerciseth, some, faculty, wherein, they, take, pride, and, so, entertaineth, them, in, good-humour, and, pleasing, conceits, towards, themselves, or, because, it, advanceth, any, other, their, ends, so, that, as, it, is, said, of, untrue, valours, that, some, men’s, valours, are, in, the, eyes, of, them, that, look, on, so, such, men’s, industries, are, in, the, eyes, of, others, or, at, least, in, regard, of, their, own, designments, only, learned, men, love, business, as, an, action, according, to, nature, as, agreeable, to, health, of, mind, as, exercise, is, to, health, of, body, taking, pleasure, in, the, action, itself, and, not, in, the, purchase, so, that, of, all, men, they, are, the, most, indefatigable, if, it, be, towards, any, business, which, can, hold, or, detain, their, mind, (6), and, if, any, man, be, laborious, in, reading, and, study, and, yet, idle, in, business, and, action, it, groweth, from, some, weakness, of, body, or, softness, of, spirit, such, as, seneca, speaketh, of, _quidam, tam, sunt, umbratiles_, _ut, putent, in, turbido, esse, quicquid, in, luce, est_, and, not, of, learning, well, may, it, be, that, such, a, point, of, a, man’s, nature, may, make, him, give, himself, to, learning, but, it, is, not, learning, that, breedeth, any, such, point, in, his, nature, (7), and, that, learning, should, take, up, too, much, time, or, leisure, answer, the, most, active, or, busy, man, that, hath, been, or, can, be, hath, (no, question), many, vacant, times, of, leisure, while, he, expecteth, the, tides, and, returns, of, business, (except, he, be, either, tedious, and, of, no, despatch, or, lightly, and, unworthily, ambitious, to, meddle, in, things, that, may, be, better, done, by, others), and, then, the, question, is, but, how, those, spaces, and, times, of, leisure, shall, be, filled, and, spent, whether, in, pleasure, or, in, studies, as, was, well, answered, by, demosthenes, to, his, adversary, æschines, that, was, a, man, given, to, pleasure, and, told, him, “that, his, orations, did, smell, of, the, lamp, ”, “indeed, ”, said, demosthenes, “there, is, a, great, difference, between, the, things, that, you, and, do, by, lamp-light, ”, so, as, no, man, need, doubt, that, learning, will, expel, business, but, rather, it, will, keep, and, defend, the, possession, of, the, mind, against, idleness, and, pleasure, which, otherwise, at, unawares, may, enter, to, the, prejudice, of, both, (8), again, for, that, other, conceit, that, learning, should, undermine, the, reverence, of, laws, and, government, it, is, assuredly, a, mere, depravation, and, calumny, without, all, shadow, of, truth, for, to, say, that, a, blind, custom, of, obedience, should, be, a, surer, obligation, than, duty, taught, and, understood, it, is, to, affirm, that, a, blind, man, may, tread, surer, by, a, guide, than, a, seeing, man, can, by, a, light, and, it, is, without, all, controversy, that, learning, doth, make, the, minds, of, men, gentle, generous, manageable, and, pliant, to, government, whereas, ignorance, makes, them, churlish, thwart, and, mutinous, and, the, evidence, of, time, doth, clear, this, assertion, considering, that, the, most, barbarous, rude, and, unlearned, times, have, been, most, subject, to, tumults, seditious, and, changes, (9), and, as, to, the, judgment, of, cato, the, censor, he, was, well, punished, for, his, blasphemy, against, learning, in, the, same, kind, wherein, he, offended, for, when, he, was, past, threescore, years, old, he, was, taken, with, an, extreme, desire, to, go, to, school, again, and, to, learn, the, greek, tongue, to, the, end, to, peruse, the, greek, authors, which, doth, well, demonstrate, that, his, former, censure, of, the, grecian, learning, was, rather, an, affected, gravity, than, according, to, the, inward, sense, of, his, own, opinion, and, as, for, virgil’s, verses, though, it, pleased, him, to, brave, the, world, in, taking, to, the, romans, the, art, of, empire, and, leaving, to, others, the, arts, of, subjects, yet, so, much, is, manifest—that, the, romans, never, ascended, to, that, height, of, empire, till, the, time, they, had, ascended, to, the, height, of, other, arts, for, in, the, time, of, the, two, first, cæsars, which, had, the, art, of, government, in, greatest, perfection, there, lived, the, best, poet, virgilius, maro, the, best, historiographer, titus, livius, the, best, antiquary, marcus, varro, and, the, best, or, second, orator, marcus, cicero, that, to, the, memory, of, man, are, known, as, for, the, accusation, of, socrates, the, time, must, be, remembered, when, it, was, prosecuted, which, was, under, the, thirty, tyrants, the, most, base, bloody, and, envious, persons, that, have, governed, which, revolution, of, state, was, no, sooner, over, but, socrates, whom, they, had, made, a, person, criminal, was, made, a, person, heroical, and, his, memory, accumulate, with, honours, divine, and, human, and, those, discourses, of, his, which, were, then, termed, corrupting, of, manners, were, after, acknowledged, for, sovereign, medicines, of, the, mind, and, manners, and, so, have, been, received, ever, since, till, this, day, let, this, therefore, serve, for, answer, to, politiques, which, in, their, humorous, severity, or, in, their, feigned, gravity, have, presumed, to, throw, imputations, upon, learning, which, redargution, nevertheless, (save, that, we, know, not, whether, our, labours, may, extend, to, other, ages), were, not, needful, for, the, present, in, regard, of, the, love, and, reverence, towards, learning, which, the, example, and, countenance, of, two, so, learned, princes, queen, elizabeth, and, your, majesty, being, as, castor, and, pollux, _lucida, sidera_, stars, of, excellent, light, and, most, benign, influence, hath, wrought, in, all, men, of, place, and, authority, in, our, nation, (1), now, therefore, we, come, to, that, third, sort, of, discredit, or, diminution, of, credit, that, groweth, unto, learning, from, learned, men, themselves, which, commonly, cleaveth, fastest, it, is, either, from, their, fortune, or, from, their, manners, or, from, the, nature, of, their, studies, for, the, first, it, is, not, in, their, power, and, the, second, is, accidental, the, third, only, is, proper, to, be, handled, but, because, we, are, not, in, hand, with, true, measure, but, with, popular, estimation, and, conceit, it, is, not, amiss, to, speak, somewhat, of, the, two, former, the, derogations, therefore, which, grow, to, learning, from, the, fortune, or, condition, of, learned, men, are, either, in, respect, of, scarcity, of, means, or, in, respect, of, privateness, of, life, and, meanness, of, employments, (2), concerning, want, and, that, it, is, the, case, of, learned, men, usually, to, begin, with, little, and, not, to, grow, rich, so, fast, as, other, men, by, reason, they, convert, not, their, labours, chiefly, to, lucre, and, increase, it, were, good, to, leave, the, commonplace, in, commendation, of, povery, to, some, friar, to, handle, to, whom, much, was, attributed, by, machiavel, in, this, point, when, he, said, “that, the, kingdom, of, the, clergy, had, been, long, before, at, an, end, if, the, reputation, and, reverence, towards, the, poverty, of, friars, had, not, borne, out, the, scandal, of, the, superfluities, and, excesses, of, bishops, and, prelates, ”, so, a, man, might, say, that, the, felicity, and, delicacy, of, princes, and, great, persons, had, long, since, turned, to, rudeness, and, barbarism, if, the, poverty, of, learning, had, not, kept, up, civility, and, honour, of, life, but, without, any, such, advantages, it, is, worthy, the, observation, what, a, reverent, and, honoured, thing, poverty, of, fortune, was, for, some, ages, in, the, roman, state, which, nevertheless, was, a, state, without, paradoxes, for, we, see, what, titus, livius, saith, in, his, introduction, _cæterum, aut, me, amor, negotii, suscepti, fallit, aut, nulla, unquam, respublica, nec, major_, _nec, sanctior_, _nec, bonis, exemplis, ditior, fuit_, _nec, in, quam, tam, sero, avaritia, luxuriaque, immigraverint_, _nec, ubi, tantus, ac, tam, diu, paupertati, ac, parsimoniæ, honos, fuerit_, we, see, likewise, after, that, the, state, of, rome, was, not, itself, but, did, degenerate, how, that, person, that, took, upon, him, to, be, counsellor, to, julius, cæsar, after, his, victory, where, to, begin, his, restoration, of, the, state, maketh, it, of, all, points, the, most, summary, to, take, away, the, estimation, of, wealth, _verum, hæc, et, omnia, mala, pariter, cum, honore, pecuniæ, desinent_, _si, neque, magistratus_, _neque, alia, vulgo, cupienda_, _venalia, erunt_, to, conclude, this, point, as, it, was, truly, said, that, _paupertas, est, virtutis, fortuna_, though, sometimes, it, come, from, vice, so, it, may, be, fitly, said, that, though, some, times, it, may, proceed, from, misgovernment, and, accident, surely, solomon, hath, pronounced, it, both, in, censure, _qui, festinat, ad, divitias, non, erit, insons_, and, in, precept, “buy, the, truth, and, sell, it, not, and, so, of, wisdom, and, knowledge, ”, judging, that, means, were, to, be, spent, upon, learning, and, not, learning, to, be, applied, to, means, and, as, for, the, privateness, or, obscureness, (as, it, may, be, in, vulgar, estimation, accounted), of, life, of, contemplative, men, it, is, a, theme, so, common, to, extol, a, private, life, not, taxed, with, sensuality, and, sloth, in, comparison, and, to, the, disadvantage, of, a, civil, life, for, safety, liberty, pleasure, and, dignity, or, at, least, freedom, from, indignity, as, no, man, handleth, it, but, handleth, it, well, such, a, consonancy, it, hath, to, men’s, conceits, in, the, expressing, and, to, men’s, consents, in, the, allowing, this, only, will, add, that, learned, men, forgotten, in, states, and, not, living, in, the, eyes, of, men, are, like, the, images, of, cassius, and, brutus, in, the, funeral, of, junia, of, which, not, being, represented, as, many, others, were, tacitus, saith, _eo, ipso, præfulgebant, quod, non, visebantur_, (3), and, for, meanness, of, employment, that, which, is, most, traduced, to, contempt, is, that, the, government, of, youth, is, commonly, allotted, to, them, which, age, because, it, is, the, age, of, least, authority, it, is, transferred, to, the, disesteeming, of, those, employments, wherein, youth, is, conversant, and, which, are, conversant, about, youth, but, how, unjust, this, traducement, is, (if, you, will, reduce, things, from, popularity, of, opinion, to, measure, of, reason), may, appear, in, that, we, see, men, are, more, curious, what, they, put, into, a, new, vessel, than, into, a, vessel, seasoned, and, what, mould, they, lay, about, a, young, plant, than, about, a, plant, corroborate, so, as, this, weakest, terms, and, times, of, all, things, use, to, have, the, best, applications, and, helps, and, will, you, hearken, to, the, hebrew, rabbins, “your, young, men, shall, see, visions, and, your, old, men, shall, dream, dreams, ”, say, they, youth, is, the, worthier, age, for, that, visions, are, nearer, apparitions, of, god, than, dreams, and, let, it, be, noted, that, howsoever, the, condition, of, life, of, _pedantes_, hath, been, scorned, upon, theatres, as, the, ape, of, tyranny, and, that, the, modern, looseness, or, negligence, hath, taken, no, due, regard, to, the, choice, of, schoolmasters, and, tutors, yet, the, ancient, wisdom, of, the, best, times, did, always, make, a, just, complaint, that, states, were, too, busy, with, their, laws, and, too, negligent, in, point, of, education, which, excellent, part, of, ancient, discipline, hath, been, in, some, sort, revived, of, late, times, by, the, colleges, of, the, jesuits, of, whom, although, in, regard, of, their, superstition, may, say, _quo, meliores_, _eo, deteriores_, yet, in, regard, of, this, and, some, other, points, concerning, human, learning, and, moral, matters, may, say, as, agesilaus, said, to, his, enemy, pharnabazus, _talis, quum, sis_, _utunam, noster, esses_, and, that, much, touching, the, discredits, drawn, from, the, fortunes, of, learned, men, (4), as, touching, the, manners, of, learned, men, it, is, a, thing, personal, and, individual, and, no, doubt, there, be, amongst, them, as, in, other, professions, of, all, temperatures, but, yet, so, as, it, is, not, without, truth, which, is, said, that, _abeunt, studua, in, mores_, studies, have, an, influence, and, operation, upon, the, manners, of, those, that, are, conversant, in, them, (5), but, upon, an, attentive, and, indifferent, review, for, my, part, cannot, find, any, disgrace, to, learning, can, proceed, from, the, manners, of, learned, men, not, inherent, to, them, as, they, are, learned, except, it, be, a, fault, (which, was, the, supposed, fault, of, demosthenes, cicero, cato, seneca, and, many, more), that, because, the, times, they, read, of, are, commonly, better, than, the, times, they, live, in, and, the, duties, taught, better, than, the, duties, practised, they, contend, sometimes, too, far, to, bring, things, to, perfection, and, to, reduce, the, corruption, of, manners, to, honesty, of, precepts, or, examples, of, too, great, height, and, yet, hereof, they, have, caveats, enough, in, their, own, walks, for, solon, when, he, was, asked, whether, he, had, given, his, citizens, the, best, laws, answered, wisely, “yea, of, such, as, they, would, receive, ”, and, plato, finding, that, his, own, heart, could, not, agree, with, the, corrupt, manners, of, his, country, refused, to, bear, place, or, office, saying, “that, a, man’s, country, was, to, be, used, as, his, parents, were, that, is, with, humble, persuasions, and, not, with, contestations, ”, and, cæsar’s, counsellor, put, in, the, same, caveat, _non, ad, vetera, instituta, revocans, quæ, jampridem, corruptis, moribus, ludibrio, sunt_, and, cicero, noteth, this, error, directly, in, cato, when, he, writes, to, his, friend, atticus, _cato, optime, sentit_, _sed, nocet, interdum, reipublicæ_, _loquitur, enim, tanquam, in, republicâ, platonis_, _non, tanquam, in, fæce, romuli_, and, the, same, cicero, doth, excuse, and, expound, the, philosophers, for, going, too, far, and, being, too, exact, in, their, prescripts, when, he, saith, _isti, ipse, præceptores, virtutis, et, magistri, videntur, fines, officiorum, paulo, longius, quam, natura, vellet, protulisse_, _ut, cum, ad, ultimum, animo, contendissemus_, _ibi, tamen_, _ubi, oportet_, _consisteremus_, and, yet, himself, might, have, said, _monitis, sum, minor, ipse, meis_, for, it, was, his, own, fault, though, not, in, so, extreme, a, degree, (6), another, fault, likewise, much, of, this, kind, hath, been, incident, to, learned, men, which, is, that, they, have, esteemed, the, preservation, good, and, honour, of, their, countries, or, masters, before, their, own, fortunes, or, safeties, for, so, saith, demosthenes, unto, the, athenians, “if, it, please, you, to, note, it, my, counsels, unto, you, are, not, such, whereby, should, grow, great, amongst, you, and, you, become, little, amongst, the, grecians, but, they, be, of, that, nature, as, they, are, sometimes, not, good, for, me, to, give, but, are, always, good, for, you, to, follow, ”, and, so, seneca, after, he, had, consecrated, that, _quinquennium, neronis_, to, the, eternal, glory, of, learned, governors, held, on, his, honest, and, loyal, course, of, good, and, free, counsel, after, his, master, grew, extremely, corrupt, in, his, government, neither, can, this, point, otherwise, be, for, learning, endueth, men’s, minds, with, a, true, sense, of, the, frailty, of, their, persons, the, casualty, of, their, fortunes, and, the, dignity, of, their, soul, and, vocation, so, that, it, is, impossible, for, them, to, esteem, that, any, greatness, of, their, own, fortune, can, be, a, true, or, worthy, end, of, their, being, and, ordainment, and, therefore, are, desirous, to, give, their, account, to, god, and, so, likewise, to, their, masters, under, god, (as, kings, and, the, states, that, they, serve), in, those, words, _ecce, tibi, lucrefeci_, and, not, _ecce, mihi, lucrefeci_, whereas, the, corrupter, sort, of, mere, politiques, that, have, not, their, thoughts, established, by, learning, in, the, love, and, apprehension, of, duty, nor, never, look, abroad, into, universality, do, refer, all, things, to, themselves, and, thrust, themselves, into, the, centre, of, the, world, as, if, all, lines, should, meet, in, them, and, their, fortunes, never, caring, in, all, tempests, what, becomes, of, the, ship, of, state, so, they, may, save, themselves, in, the, cockboat, of, their, own, fortune, whereas, men, that, feel, the, weight, of, duty, and, know, the, limits, of, self-love, use, to, make, good, their, places, and, duties, though, with, peril, and, if, they, stand, in, seditious, and, violent, alterations, it, is, rather, the, reverence, which, many, times, both, adverse, parts, do, give, to, honesty, than, any, versatile, advantage, of, their, own, carriage, but, for, this, point, of, tender, sense, and, fast, obligation, of, duty, which, learning, doth, endue, the, mind, withal, howsoever, fortune, may, tax, it, and, many, in, the, depth, of, their, corrupt, principles, may, despise, it, yet, it, will, receive, an, open, allowance, and, therefore, needs, the, less, disproof, or, excuse, (7), another, fault, incident, commonly, to, learned, men, which, may, be, more, properly, defended, than, truly, denied, is, that, they, fail, sometimes, in, applying, themselves, to, particular, persons, which, want, of, exact, application, ariseth, from, two, causes—the, one, because, the, largeness, of, their, mind, can, hardly, confine, itself, to, dwell, in, the, exquisite, observation, or, examination, of, the, nature, and, customs, of, one, person, for, it, is, a, speech, for, a, lover, and, not, for, a, wise, man, _satis, magnum, alter, alteri, theatrum, sumus_, nevertheless, shall, yield, that, he, that, cannot, contract, the, sight, of, his, mind, as, well, as, disperse, and, dilate, it, wanteth, a, great, faculty, but, there, is, a, second, cause, which, is, no, inability, but, a, rejection, upon, choice, and, judgment, for, the, honest, and, just, bounds, of, observation, by, one, person, upon, another, extend, no, further, but, to, understand, him, sufficiently, whereby, not, to, give, him, offence, or, whereby, to, be, able, to, give, him, faithful, counsel, or, whereby, to, stand, upon, reasonable, guard, and, caution, in, respect, of, a, man’s, self, but, to, be, speculative, into, another, man, to, the, end, to, know, how, to, work, him, or, wind, him, or, govern, him, proceedeth, from, a, heart, that, is, double, and, cloven, and, not, entire, and, ingenuous, which, as, in, friendship, it, is, want, of, integrity, so, towards, princes, or, superiors, is, want, of, duty, for, the, custom, of, the, levant, which, is, that, subjects, do, forbear, to, gaze, or, fix, their, eyes, upon, princes, is, in, the, outward, ceremony, barbarous, but, the, moral, is, good, for, men, ought, not, by, cunning, and, bent, observations, to, pierce, and, penetrate, into, the, hearts, of, kings, which, the, scripture, hath, declared, to, be, inscrutable, (8), there, is, yet, another, fault, (with, which, will, conclude, this, part), which, is, often, noted, in, learned, men, that, they, do, many, times, fail, to, observe, decency, and, discretion, in, their, behaviour, and, carriage, and, commit, errors, in, small, and, ordinary, points, of, action, so, as, the, vulgar, sort, of, capacities, do, make, a, judgment, of, them, in, greater, matters, by, that, which, they, find, wanting, in, them, in, smaller, but, this, consequence, doth, oft, deceive, men, for, which, do, refer, them, over, to, that, which, was, said, by, themistocles, arrogantly, and, uncivilly, being, applied, to, himself, out, of, his, own, mouth, but, being, applied, to, the, general, state, of, this, question, pertinently, and, justly, when, being, invited, to, touch, a, lute, he, said, “he, could, not, fiddle, but, he, could, make, a, small, town, a, great, state, ”, so, no, doubt, many, may, be, well, seen, in, the, passages, of, government, and, policy, which, are, to, seek, in, little, and, punctual, occasions, refer, them, also, to, that, which, plato, said, of, his, master, socrates, whom, he, compared, to, the, gallipots, of, apothecaries, which, on, the, outside, had, apes, and, owls, and, antiques, but, contained, within, sovereign, and, precious, liquors, and, confections, acknowledging, that, to, an, external, report, he, was, not, without, superficial, levities, and, deformities, but, was, inwardly, replenished, with, excellent, virtues, and, powers, and, so, much, touching, the, point, of, manners, of, learned, men, (9), but, in, the, meantime, have, no, purpose, to, give, allowance, to, some, conditions, and, courses, base, and, unworthy, wherein, divers, professors, of, learning, have, wronged, themselves, and, gone, too, far, such, as, were, those, trencher, philosophers, which, in, the, later, age, of, the, roman, state, were, usually, in, the, houses, of, great, persons, being, little, better, than, solemn, parasites, of, which, kind, lucian, maketh, a, merry, description, of, the, philosopher, that, the, great, lady, took, to, ride, with, her, in, her, coach, and, would, needs, have, him, carry, her, little, dog, which, he, doing, officiously, and, yet, uncomely, the, page, scoffed, and, said, “that, he, doubted, the, philosopher, of, a, stoic, would, turn, to, be, a, cynic, ”, but, above, all, the, rest, this, gross, and, palpable, flattery, whereunto, many, not, unlearned, have, abased, and, abused, their, wits, and, pens, turning, (as, du, bartas, saith), hecuba, into, helena, and, faustina, into, lucretia, hath, most, diminished, the, price, and, estimation, of, learning, neither, is, the, modern, dedication, of, books, and, writings, as, to, patrons, to, be, commended, for, that, books, (such, as, are, worthy, the, name, of, books), ought, to, have, no, patrons, but, truth, and, reason, and, the, ancient, custom, was, to, dedicate, them, only, to, private, and, equal, friends, or, to, entitle, the, books, with, their, names, or, if, to, kings, and, great, persons, it, was, to, some, such, as, the, argument, of, the, book, was, fit, and, proper, for, but, these, and, the, like, courses, may, deserve, rather, reprehension, than, defence, (10), not, that, can, tax, or, condemn, the, morigeration, or, application, of, learned, men, to, men, in, fortune, for, the, answer, was, good, that, diogenes, made, to, one, that, asked, him, in, mockery, “how, it, came, to, pass, that, philosophers, were, the, followers, of, rich, men, and, not, rich, men, of, philosophers, ”, he, answered, soberly, and, yet, sharply, “because, the, one, sort, knew, what, they, had, need, of, and, the, other, did, not, ”, and, of, the, like, nature, was, the, answer, which, aristippus, made, when, having, a, petition, to, dionysius, and, no, ear, given, to, him, he, fell, down, at, his, feet, whereupon, dionysius, stayed, and, gave, him, the, hearing, and, granted, it, and, afterwards, some, person, tender, on, the, behalf, of, philosophy, reproved, aristippus, that, he, would, offer, the, profession, of, philosophy, such, an, indignity, as, for, a, private, suit, to, fall, at, a, tyrant’s, feet, but, he, answered, “it, was, not, his, fault, but, it, was, the, fault, of, dionysius, that, had, his, ears, in, his, feet, ”, neither, was, it, accounted, weakness, but, discretion, in, him, that, would, not, dispute, his, best, with, adrianus, cæsar, excusing, himself, “that, it, was, reason, to, yield, to, him, that, commanded, thirty, legions, ”, these, and, the, like, applications, and, stooping, to, points, of, necessity, and, convenience, cannot, be, disallowed, for, though, they, may, have, some, outward, baseness, yet, in, a, judgment, truly, made, they, are, to, be, accounted, submissions, to, the, occasion, and, not, to, the, person, (1), now, proceed, to, those, errors, and, vanities, which, have, intervened, amongst, the, studies, themselves, of, the, learned, which, is, that, which, is, principal, and, proper, to, the, present, argument, wherein, my, purpose, is, not, to, make, a, justification, of, the, errors, but, by, a, censure, and, separation, of, the, errors, to, make, a, justification, of, that, which, is, good, and, sound, and, to, deliver, that, from, the, aspersion, of, the, other, for, we, see, that, it, is, the, manner, of, men, to, scandalise, and, deprave, that, which, retaineth, the, state, and, virtue, by, taking, advantage, upon, that, which, is, corrupt, and, degenerate, as, the, heathens, in, the, primitive, church, used, to, blemish, and, taint, the, christians, with, the, faults, and, corruptions, of, heretics, but, nevertheless, have, no, meaning, at, this, time, to, make, any, exact, animadversion, of, the, errors, and, impediments, in, matters, of, learning, which, are, more, secret, and, remote, from, vulgar, opinion, but, only, to, speak, unto, such, as, do, fall, under, or, near, unto, a, popular, observation, (2), there, be, therefore, chiefly, three, vanities, in, studies, whereby, learning, hath, been, most, traduced, for, those, things, we, do, esteem, vain, which, are, either, false, or, frivolous, those, which, either, have, no, truth, or, no, use, and, those, persons, we, esteem, vain, which, are, either, credulous, or, curious, and, curiosity, is, either, in, matter, or, words, so, that, in, reason, as, well, as, in, experience, there, fall, out, to, be, these, three, distempers, (as, may, term, them), of, learning—the, first, fantastical, learning, the, second, contentious, learning, and, the, last, delicate, learning, vain, imaginations, vain, altercations, and, vain, affectations, and, with, the, last, will, begin, martin, luther, conducted, no, doubt, by, a, higher, providence, but, in, discourse, of, reason, finding, what, a, province, he, had, undertaken, against, the, bishop, of, rome, and, the, degenerate, traditions, of, the, church, and, finding, his, own, solitude, being, in, nowise, aided, by, the, opinions, of, his, own, time, was, enforced, to, awake, all, antiquity, and, to, call, former, times, to, his, succours, to, make, a, party, against, the, present, time, so, that, the, ancient, authors, both, in, divinity, and, in, humanity, which, had, long, time, slept, in, libraries, began, generally, to, be, read, and, revolved, this, by, consequence, did, draw, on, a, necessity, of, a, more, exquisite, travail, in, the, languages, original, wherein, those, authors, did, write, for, the, better, understanding, of, those, authors, and, the, better, advantage, of, pressing, and, applying, their, words, and, thereof, grew, again, a, delight, in, their, manner, of, style, and, phrase, and, an, admiration, of, that, kind, of, writing, which, was, much, furthered, and, precipitated, by, the, enmity, and, opposition, that, the, propounders, of, those, primitive, but, seeming, new, opinions, had, against, the, schoolmen, who, were, generally, of, the, contrary, part, and, whose, writings, were, altogether, in, a, differing, style, and, form, taking, liberty, to, coin, and, frame, new, terms, of, art, to, express, their, own, sense, and, to, avoid, circuit, of, speech, without, regard, to, the, pureness, pleasantness, and, (as, may, call, it), lawfulness, of, the, phrase, or, word, and, again, because, the, great, labour, then, was, with, the, people, (of, whom, the, pharisees, were, wont, to, say, _execrabilis, ista, turba_, _quæ, non, novit, legem_), for, the, winning, and, persuading, of, them, there, grew, of, necessity, in, chief, price, and, request, eloquence, and, variety, of, discourse, as, the, fittest, and, forciblest, access, into, the, capacity, of, the, vulgar, sort, so, that, these, four, causes, concurring—the, admiration, of, ancient, authors, the, hate, of, the, schoolmen, the, exact, study, of, languages, and, the, efficacy, of, preaching—did, bring, in, an, affectionate, study, of, eloquence, and, copy, of, speech, which, then, began, to, flourish, this, grew, speedily, to, an, excess, for, men, began, to, hunt, more, after, words, than, matter—more, after, the, choiceness, of, the, phrase, and, the, round, and, clean, composition, of, the, sentence, and, the, sweet, falling, of, the, clauses, and, the, varying, and, illustration, of, their, works, with, tropes, and, figures, than, after, the, weight, of, matter, worth, of, subject, soundness, of, argument, life, of, invention, or, depth, of, judgment, then, grew, the, flowing, and, watery, vein, of, osorius, the, portugal, bishop, to, be, in, price, then, did, sturmius, spend, such, infinite, and, curious, pains, upon, cicero, the, orator, and, hermogenes, the, rhetorician, besides, his, own, books, of, periods, and, imitation, and, the, like, then, did, car, of, cambridge, and, ascham, with, their, lectures, and, writings, almost, deify, cicero, and, demosthenes, and, allure, all, young, men, that, were, studious, unto, that, delicate, and, polished, kind, of, learning, then, did, erasmus, take, occasion, to, make, the, scoffing, echo, _decem, annos, consuumpsi, in, legendo, cicerone_, and, the, echo, answered, in, greek, _one_, _asine_, then, grew, the, learning, of, the, schoolmen, to, be, utterly, despised, as, barbarous, in, sum, the, whole, inclination, and, bent, of, those, times, was, rather, towards, copy, than, weight, (3), here, therefore, [is], the, first, distemper, of, learning, when, men, study, words, and, not, matter, whereof, though, have, represented, an, example, of, late, times, yet, it, hath, been, and, will, be, _secundum, majus, et, minus_, in, all, time, and, how, is, it, possible, but, this, should, have, an, operation, to, discredit, learning, even, with, vulgar, capacities, when, they, see, learned, men’s, works, like, the, first, letter, of, a, patent, or, limited, book, which, though, it, hath, large, flourishes, yet, it, is, but, a, letter, it, seems, to, me, that, pygmalion’s, frenzy, is, a, good, emblem, or, portraiture, of, this, vanity, for, words, are, but, the, images, of, matter, and, except, they, have, life, of, reason, and, invention, to, fall, in, love, with, them, is, all, one, as, to, fall, in, love, with, a, picture, (4), but, yet, notwithstanding, it, is, a, thing, not, hastily, to, be, condemned, to, clothe, and, adorn, the, obscurity, even, of, philosophy, itself, with, sensible, and, plausible, elocution, for, hereof, we, have, great, examples, in, xenophon, cicero, seneca, plutarch, and, of, plato, also, in, some, degree, and, hereof, likewise, there, is, great, use, for, surely, to, the, severe, inquisition, of, truth, and, the, deep, progress, into, philosophy, it, is, some, hindrance, because, it, is, too, early, satisfactory, to, the, mind, of, man, and, quencheth, the, desire, of, further, search, before, we, come, to, a, just, period, but, then, if, a, man, be, to, have, any, use, of, such, knowledge, in, civil, occasions, of, conference, counsel, persuasion, discourse, or, the, like, then, shall, he, find, it, prepared, to, his, hands, in, those, authors, which, write, in, that, manner, but, the, excess, of, this, is, so, justly, contemptible, that, as, hercules, when, he, saw, the, image, of, adonis, venus’, minion, in, a, temple, said, in, disdain, _nil, sacri, es_, so, there, is, none, of, hercules’, followers, in, learning—that, is, the, more, severe, and, laborious, sort, of, inquirers, into, truth—but, will, despise, those, delicacies, and, affectations, as, indeed, capable, of, no, divineness, and, thus, much, of, the, first, disease, or, distemper, of, learning, (5), the, second, which, followeth, is, in, nature, worse, than, the, former, for, as, substance, of, matter, is, better, than, beauty, of, words, so, contrariwise, vain, matter, is, worse, than, vain, words, wherein, it, seemeth, the, reprehension, of, st, paul, was, not, only, proper, for, those, times, but, prophetical, for, the, times, following, and, not, only, respective, to, divinity, but, extensive, to, all, knowledge, _devita, profanas, vocum, novitates_, _et, oppositiones, falsi, nominis, scientiæ_, for, he, assigneth, two, marks, and, badges, of, suspected, and, falsified, science, the, one, the, novelty, and, strangeness, of, terms, the, other, the, strictness, of, positions, which, of, necessity, doth, induce, oppositions, and, so, questions, and, altercations, surely, like, as, many, substances, in, nature, which, are, solid, do, putrefy, and, corrupt, into, worms, —so, it, is, the, property, of, good, and, sound, knowledge, to, putrefy, and, dissolve, into, a, number, of, subtle, idle, unwholesome, and, (as, may, term, them), vermiculate, questions, which, have, indeed, a, kind, of, quickness, and, life, of, spirit, but, no, soundness, of, matter, or, goodness, of, quality, this, kind, of, degenerate, learning, did, chiefly, reign, amongst, the, schoolmen, who, having, sharp, and, strong, wits, and, abundance, of, leisure, and, small, variety, of, reading, but, their, wits, being, shut, up, in, the, cells, of, a, few, authors, (chiefly, aristotle, their, dictator), as, their, persons, were, shut, up, in, the, cells, of, monasteries, and, colleges, and, knowing, little, history, either, of, nature, or, time, did, out, of, no, great, quantity, of, matter, and, infinite, agitation, of, wit, spin, out, unto, us, those, laborious, webs, of, learning, which, are, extant, in, their, books, for, the, wit, and, mind, of, man, if, it, work, upon, matter, which, is, the, contemplation, of, the, creatures, of, god, worketh, according, to, the, stuff, and, is, limited, thereby, but, if, it, work, upon, itself, as, the, spider, worketh, his, web, then, it, is, endless, and, brings, forth, indeed, cobwebs, of, learning, admirable, for, the, fineness, of, thread, and, work, but, of, no, substance, or, profit, (6), this, same, unprofitable, subtility, or, curiosity, is, of, two, sorts, either, in, the, subject, itself, that, they, handle, when, it, is, a, fruitless, speculation, or, controversy, (whereof, there, are, no, small, number, both, in, divinity, and, philosophy), or, in, the, manner, or, method, of, handling, of, a, knowledge, which, amongst, them, was, this—upon, every, particular, position, or, assertion, to, frame, objections, and, to, those, objections, solutions, which, solutions, were, for, the, most, part, not, confutations, but, distinctions, whereas, indeed, the, strength, of, all, sciences, is, as, the, strength, of, the, old, man’s, faggot, in, the, bond, for, the, harmony, of, a, science, supporting, each, part, the, other, is, and, ought, to, be, the, true, and, brief, confutation, and, suppression, of, all, the, smaller, sort, of, objections, but, on, the, other, side, if, you, take, out, every, axiom, as, the, sticks, of, the, faggot, one, by, one, you, may, quarrel, with, them, and, bend, them, and, break, them, at, your, pleasure, so, that, as, was, said, of, seneca, _verborum, minutiis, rerum, frangit, pondera_, so, a, man, may, truly, say, of, the, schoolmen, _quæstionum, minutiis, scientiarum, frangunt, soliditatem_, for, were, it, not, better, for, a, man, in, fair, room, to, set, up, one, great, light, or, branching, candlestick, of, lights, than, to, go, about, with, a, small, watch-candle, into, every, corner, and, such, is, their, method, that, rests, not, so, much, upon, evidence, of, truth, proved, by, arguments, authorities, similitudes, examples, as, upon, particular, confutations, and, solutions, of, every, scruple, cavillation, and, objection, breeding, for, the, most, part, one, question, as, fast, as, it, solveth, another, even, as, in, the, former, resemblance, when, you, carry, the, light, into, one, corner, you, darken, the, rest, so, that, the, fable, and, fiction, of, scylla, seemeth, to, be, a, lively, image, of, this, kind, of, philosophy, or, knowledge, which, was, transformed, into, a, comely, virgin, for, the, upper, parts, but, then, _candida, succinctam, latrantibus, inguina, monstris_, so, the, generalities, of, the, schoolmen, are, for, a, while, good, and, proportionable, but, then, when, you, descend, into, their, distinctions, and, decisions, instead, of, a, fruitful, womb, for, the, use, and, benefit, of, man’s, life, they, end, in, monstrous, altercations, and, barking, questions, so, as, it, is, not, possible, but, this, quality, of, knowledge, must, fall, under, popular, contempt, the, people, being, apt, to, contemn, truths, upon, occasion, of, controversies, and, altercations, and, to, think, they, are, all, out, of, their, way, which, never, meet, and, when, they, see, such, digladiation, about, subtleties, and, matters, of, no, use, or, moment, they, easily, fall, upon, that, judgment, of, dionysius, of, syracusa, _verba, ista, sunt, senum, otiosorum_, (7), notwithstanding, certain, it, is, that, if, those, schoolmen, to, their, great, thirst, of, truth, and, unwearied, travail, of, wit, had, joined, variety, and, universality, of, reading, and, contemplation, they, had, proved, excellent, lights, to, the, great, advancement, of, all, learning, and, knowledge, but, as, they, are, they, are, great, undertakers, indeed, and, fierce, with, dark, keeping, but, as, in, the, inquiry, of, the, divine, truth, their, pride, inclined, to, leave, the, oracle, of, god’s, word, and, to, vanish, in, the, mixture, of, their, own, inventions, so, in, the, inquisition, of, nature, they, ever, left, the, oracle, of, god’s, works, and, adored, the, deceiving, and, deformed, images, which, the, unequal, mirror, of, their, own, minds, or, a, few, received, authors, or, principles, did, represent, unto, them, and, thus, much, for, the, second, disease, of, learning, (8), for, the, third, vice, or, disease, of, learning, which, concerneth, deceit, or, untruth, it, is, of, all, the, rest, the, foulest, as, that, which, doth, destroy, the, essential, form, of, knowledge, which, is, nothing, but, a, representation, of, truth, for, the, truth, of, being, and, the, truth, of, knowing, are, one, differing, no, more, than, the, direct, beam, and, the, beam, reflected, this, vice, therefore, brancheth, itself, into, two, sorts, delight, in, deceiving, and, aptness, to, be, deceived, imposture, and, credulity, which, although, they, appear, to, be, of, a, diverse, nature, the, one, seeming, to, proceed, of, cunning, and, the, other, of, simplicity, yet, certainly, they, do, for, the, most, part, concur, for, as, the, verse, noteth—, “percontatorem, fugito, nam, garrulus, idem, est, ”, an, inquisitive, man, is, a, prattler, so, upon, the, like, reason, a, credulous, man, is, a, deceiver, as, we, see, it, in, fame, that, he, that, will, easily, believe, rumours, will, as, easily, augment, rumours, and, add, somewhat, to, them, of, his, own, which, tacitus, wisely, noteth, when, he, saith, _fingunt, simul, creduntque_, so, great, an, affinity, hath, fiction, and, belief, (9), this, facility, of, credit, and, accepting, or, admitting, things, weakly, authorised, or, warranted, is, of, two, kinds, according, to, the, subject, for, it, is, either, a, belief, of, history, or, as, the, lawyers, speak, matter, of, fact, or, else, of, matter, of, art, and, opinion, as, to, the, former, we, see, the, experience, and, inconvenience, of, this, error, in, ecclesiastical, history, which, hath, too, easily, received, and, registered, reports, and, narrations, of, miracles, wrought, by, martyrs, hermits, or, monks, of, the, desert, and, other, holy, men, and, their, relics, shrines, chapels, and, images, which, though, they, had, a, passage, for, a, time, by, the, ignorance, of, the, people, the, superstitious, simplicity, of, some, and, the, politic, toleration, of, others, holding, them, but, as, divine, poesies, yet, after, a, period, of, time, when, the, mist, began, to, clear, up, they, grew, to, be, esteemed, but, as, old, wives’, fables, impostures, of, the, clergy, illusions, of, spirits, and, badges, of, antichrist, to, the, great, scandal, and, detriment, of, religion, (10), so, in, natural, history, we, see, there, hath, not, been, that, choice, and, judgment, used, as, ought, to, have, been, as, may, appear, in, the, writings, of, plinius, cardanus, albertus, and, divers, of, the, arabians, being, fraught, with, much, fabulous, matter, a, great, part, not, only, untried, but, notoriously, untrue, to, the, great, derogation, of, the, credit, of, natural, philosophy, with, the, grave, and, sober, kind, of, wits, wherein, the, wisdom, and, integrity, of, aristotle, is, worthy, to, be, observed, that, having, made, so, diligent, and, exquisite, a, history, of, living, creatures, hath, mingled, it, sparingly, with, any, vain, or, feigned, matter, and, yet, on, the, other, side, hath, cast, all, prodigious, narrations, which, he, thought, worthy, the, recording, into, one, book, excellently, discerning, that, matter, of, manifest, truth, such, whereupon, observation, and, rule, was, to, be, built, was, not, to, be, mingled, or, weakened, with, matter, of, doubtful, credit, and, yet, again, that, rarities, and, reports, that, seem, uncredible, are, not, to, be, suppressed, or, denied, to, the, memory, of, men, (11), and, as, for, the, facility, of, credit, which, is, yielded, to, arts, and, opinions, it, is, likewise, of, two, kinds, either, when, too, much, belief, is, attributed, to, the, arts, themselves, or, to, certain, authors, in, any, art, the, sciences, themselves, which, have, had, better, intelligence, and, confederacy, with, the, imagination, of, man, than, with, his, reason, are, three, in, number, astrology, natural, magic, and, alchemy, of, which, sciences, nevertheless, the, ends, or, pretences, are, noble, for, astrology, pretendeth, to, discover, that, correspondence, or, concatenation, which, is, between, the, superior, globe, and, the, inferior, natural, magic, pretendeth, to, call, and, reduce, natural, philosophy, from, variety, of, speculations, to, the, magnitude, of, works, and, alchemy, pretendeth, to, make, separation, of, all, the, unlike, parts, of, bodies, which, in, mixtures, of, natures, are, incorporate, but, the, derivations, and, prosecutions, to, these, ends, both, in, the, theories, and, in, the, practices, are, full, of, error, and, vanity, which, the, great, professors, themselves, have, sought, to, veil, over, and, conceal, by, enigmatical, writings, and, referring, themselves, to, auricular, traditions, and, such, other, devices, to, save, the, credit, of, impostures, and, yet, surely, to, alchemy, this, right, is, due, that, it, may, be, compared, to, the, husbandman, whereof, æsop, makes, the, fable, that, when, he, died, told, his, sons, that, he, had, left, unto, them, gold, buried, underground, in, his, vineyard, and, they, digged, over, all, the, ground, and, gold, they, found, none, but, by, reason, of, their, stirring, and, digging, the, mould, about, the, roots, of, their, vines, they, had, a, great, vintage, the, year, following, so, assuredly, the, search, and, stir, to, make, gold, hath, brought, to, light, a, great, number, of, good, and, fruitful, inventions, and, experiments, as, well, for, the, disclosing, of, nature, as, for, the, use, of, man’s, life, (12), and, as, for, the, overmuch, credit, that, hath, been, given, unto, authors, in, sciences, in, making, them, dictators, that, their, words, should, stand, and, not, consuls, to, give, advice, the, damage, is, infinite, that, sciences, have, received, thereby, as, the, principal, cause, that, hath, kept, them, low, at, a, stay, without, growth, or, advancement, for, hence, it, hath, come, that, in, arts, mechanical, the, first, deviser, comes, shortest, and, time, addeth, and, perfecteth, but, in, sciences, the, first, author, goeth, furthest, and, time, leeseth, and, corrupteth, so, we, see, artillery, sailing, printing, and, the, like, were, grossly, managed, at, the, first, and, by, time, accommodated, and, refined, but, contrariwise, the, philosophies, and, sciences, of, aristotle, plato, democritus, hippocrates, euclides, archimedes, of, most, vigour, at, the, first, and, by, time, degenerate, and, imbased, whereof, the, reason, is, no, other, but, that, in, the, former, many, wits, and, industries, have, contributed, in, one, and, in, the, latter, many, wits, and, industries, have, been, spent, about, the, wit, of, some, one, whom, many, times, they, have, rather, depraved, than, illustrated, for, as, water, will, not, ascend, higher, than, the, level, of, the, first, spring-head, from, whence, it, descendeth, so, knowledge, derived, from, aristotle, and, exempted, from, liberty, of, examination, will, not, rise, again, higher, than, the, knowledge, of, aristotle, and, therefore, although, the, position, be, good, _oportet, discentem, credere_, yet, it, must, be, coupled, with, this, _oportet, edoctum, judicare_, for, disciples, do, owe, unto, masters, only, a, temporary, belief, and, a, suspension, of, their, own, judgment, till, they, be, fully, instructed, and, not, an, absolute, resignation, or, perpetual, captivity, and, therefore, to, conclude, this, point, will, say, no, more, but, so, let, great, authors, have, their, due, as, time, which, is, the, author, of, authors, be, not, deprived, of, his, due—which, is, further, and, further, to, discover, truth, thus, have, gone, over, these, three, diseases, of, learning, besides, the, which, there, are, some, other, rather, peccant, humours, than, formed, diseases, which, nevertheless, are, not, so, secret, and, intrinsic, but, that, they, fall, under, a, popular, observation, and, traducement, and, therefore, are, not, to, be, passed, over, (1), the, first, of, these, is, the, extreme, affecting, of, two, extremities, the, one, antiquity, the, other, novelty, wherein, it, seemeth, the, children, of, time, do, take, after, the, nature, and, malice, of, the, father, for, as, he, devoureth, his, children, so, one, of, them, seeketh, to, devour, and, suppress, the, other, while, antiquity, envieth, there, should, be, new, additions, and, novelty, cannot, be, content, to, add, but, it, must, deface, surely, the, advice, of, the, prophet, is, the, true, direction, in, this, matter, _state, super, vias, antiquas_, _et, videte, quænam, sit, via, recta, et, bona, et, ambulate, in, ea_, antiquity, deserveth, that, reverence, that, men, should, make, a, stand, thereupon, and, discover, what, is, the, best, way, but, when, the, discovery, is, well, taken, then, to, make, progression, and, to, speak, truly, _antiquitas, sæculi, juventus, mundi_, these, times, are, the, ancient, times, when, the, world, is, ancient, and, not, those, which, we, account, ancient, _ordine, retrogrado_, by, a, computation, backward, from, ourselves, (2), another, error, induced, by, the, former, is, a, distrust, that, anything, should, be, now, to, be, found, out, which, the, world, should, have, missed, and, passed, over, so, long, time, as, if, the, same, objection, were, to, be, made, to, time, that, lucian, maketh, to, jupiter, and, other, the, heathen, gods, of, which, he, wondereth, that, they, begot, so, many, children, in, old, time, and, begot, none, in, his, time, and, asketh, whether, they, were, become, septuagenary, or, whether, the, law, _papia_, made, against, old, men’s, marriages, had, restrained, them, so, it, seemeth, men, doubt, lest, time, is, become, past, children, and, generation, wherein, contrariwise, we, see, commonly, the, levity, and, unconstancy, of, men’s, judgments, which, till, a, matter, be, done, wonder, that, it, can, be, done, and, as, soon, as, it, is, done, wonder, again, that, it, was, no, sooner, done, as, we, see, in, the, expedition, of, alexander, into, asia, which, at, first, was, prejudged, as, a, vast, and, impossible, enterprise, and, yet, afterwards, it, pleaseth, livy, to, make, no, more, of, it, than, this, _nil, aliud, quàm, bene, ausus, vana, contemnere_, and, the, same, happened, to, columbus, in, the, western, navigation, but, in, intellectual, matters, it, is, much, more, common, as, may, be, seen, in, most, of, the, propositions, of, euclid, which, till, they, be, demonstrate, they, seem, strange, to, our, assent, but, being, demonstrate, our, mind, accepteth, of, them, by, a, kind, of, relation, (as, the, lawyers, speak), as, if, we, had, known, them, before, (3), another, error, that, hath, also, some, affinity, with, the, former, is, a, conceit, that, of, former, opinions, or, sects, after, variety, and, examination, the, best, hath, still, prevailed, and, suppressed, the, rest, so, as, if, a, man, should, begin, the, labour, of, a, new, search, he, were, but, like, to, light, upon, somewhat, formerly, rejected, and, by, rejection, brought, into, oblivion, as, if, the, multitude, or, the, wisest, for, the, multitude’s, sake, were, not, ready, to, give, passage, rather, to, that, which, is, popular, and, superficial, than, to, that, which, is, substantial, and, profound, for, the, truth, is, that, time, seemeth, to, be, of, the, nature, of, a, river, or, stream, which, carrieth, down, to, us, that, which, is, light, and, blown, up, and, sinketh, and, drowneth, that, which, is, weighty, and, solid, (4), another, error, of, a, diverse, nature, from, all, the, former, is, the, over-early, and, peremptory, reduction, of, knowledge, into, arts, and, methods, from, which, time, commonly, sciences, receive, small, or, no, augmentation, but, as, young, men, when, they, knit, and, shape, perfectly, do, seldom, grow, to, a, further, stature, so, knowledge, while, it, is, in, aphorisms, and, observations, it, is, in, growth, but, when, it, once, is, comprehended, in, exact, methods, it, may, perchance, be, further, polished, and, illustrate, and, accommodated, for, use, and, practice, but, it, increaseth, no, more, in, bulk, and, substance, (5), another, error, which, doth, succeed, that, which, we, last, mentioned, is, that, after, the, distribution, of, particular, arts, and, sciences, men, have, abandoned, universality, or, _philosophia, prima_, which, cannot, but, cease, and, stop, all, progression, for, no, perfect, discovery, can, be, made, upon, a, flat, or, a, level, neither, is, it, possible, to, discover, the, more, remote, and, deeper, parts, of, any, science, if, you, stand, but, upon, the, level, of, the, same, science, and, ascend, not, to, a, higher, science, (6), another, error, hath, proceeded, from, too, great, a, reverence, and, a, kind, of, adoration, of, the, mind, and, understanding, of, man, by, means, whereof, men, have, withdrawn, themselves, too, much, from, the, contemplation, of, nature, and, the, observations, of, experience, and, have, tumbled, up, and, down, in, their, own, reason, and, conceits, upon, these, intellectualists, which, are, notwithstanding, commonly, taken, for, the, most, sublime, and, divine, philosophers, heraclitus, gave, a, just, censure, saying, —“men, sought, truth, in, their, own, little, worlds, and, not, in, the, great, and, common, world, ”, for, they, disdain, to, spell, and, so, by, degrees, to, read, in, the, volume, of, god’s, works, and, contrariwise, by, continual, meditation, and, agitation, of, wit, do, urge, and, as, it, were, invocate, their, own, spirits, to, divine, and, give, oracles, unto, them, whereby, they, are, deservedly, deluded, (7), another, error, that, hath, some, connection, with, this, latter, is, that, men, have, used, to, infect, their, meditations, opinions, and, doctrines, with, some, conceits, which, they, have, most, admired, or, some, sciences, which, they, have, most, applied, and, given, all, things, else, a, tincture, according, to, them, utterly, untrue, and, improper, so, hath, plato, intermingled, his, philosophy, with, theology, and, aristotle, with, logic, and, the, second, school, of, plato, proclus, and, the, rest, with, the, mathematics, for, these, were, the, arts, which, had, a, kind, of, primogeniture, with, them, severally, so, have, the, alchemists, made, a, philosophy, out, of, a, few, experiments, of, the, furnace, and, gilbertus, our, countryman, hath, made, a, philosophy, out, of, the, observations, of, a, loadstone, so, cicero, when, reciting, the, several, opinions, of, the, nature, of, the, soul, he, found, a, musician, that, held, the, soul, was, but, a, harmony, saith, pleasantly, _hic, ab, arte, sua, non, recessit_, _&c, _, but, of, these, conceits, aristotle, speaketh, seriously, and, wisely, when, he, saith, _qui, respiciunt, ad, pauca, de, facili, pronunciant_, (8), another, error, is, an, impatience, of, doubt, and, haste, to, assertion, without, due, and, mature, suspension, of, judgment, for, the, two, ways, of, contemplation, are, not, unlike, the, two, ways, of, action, commonly, spoken, of, by, the, ancients, the, one, plain, and, smooth, in, the, beginning, and, in, the, end, impassable, the, other, rough, and, troublesome, in, the, entrance, but, after, a, while, fair, and, even, so, it, is, in, contemplation, if, a, man, will, begin, with, certainties, he, shall, end, in, doubts, but, if, he, will, be, content, to, begin, with, doubts, he, shall, end, in, certainties, (9), another, error, is, in, the, manner, of, the, tradition, and, delivery, of, knowledge, which, is, for, the, most, part, magistral, and, peremptory, and, not, ingenuous, and, faithful, in, a, sort, as, may, be, soonest, believed, and, not, easiest, examined, it, is, true, that, in, compendious, treatises, for, practice, that, form, is, not, to, be, disallowed, but, in, the, true, handling, of, knowledge, men, ought, not, to, fall, either, on, the, one, side, into, the, vein, of, velleius, the, epicurean, _nil, tam, metuens, quam, ne, dubitare, aliqua, de, revideretur_, nor, on, the, other, side, into, socrates, his, ironical, doubting, of, all, things, but, to, propound, things, sincerely, with, more, or, less, asseveration, as, they, stand, in, a, man’s, own, judgment, proved, more, or, less, (10), other, errors, there, are, in, the, scope, that, men, propound, to, themselves, whereunto, they, bend, their, endeavours, for, whereas, the, more, constant, and, devote, kind, of, professors, of, any, science, ought, to, propound, to, themselves, to, make, some, additions, to, their, science, they, convert, their, labours, to, aspire, to, certain, second, prizes, as, to, be, a, profound, interpreter, or, commentor, to, be, a, sharp, champion, or, defender, to, be, a, methodical, compounder, or, abridger, and, so, the, patrimony, of, knowledge, cometh, to, be, sometimes, improved, but, seldom, augmented, (11), but, the, greatest, error, of, all, the, rest, is, the, mistaking, or, misplacing, of, the, last, or, furthest, end, of, knowledge, for, men, have, entered, into, a, desire, of, learning, and, knowledge, sometimes, upon, a, natural, curiosity, and, inquisitive, appetite, sometimes, to, entertain, their, minds, with, variety, and, delight, sometimes, for, ornament, and, reputation, and, sometimes, to, enable, them, to, victory, of, wit, and, contradiction, and, most, times, for, lucre, and, profession, and, seldom, sincerely, to, give, a, true, account, of, their, gift, of, reason, to, the, benefit, and, use, of, men, as, if, there, were, sought, in, knowledge, a, couch, whereupon, to, rest, a, searching, and, restless, spirit, or, a, terrace, for, a, wandering, and, variable, mind, to, walk, up, and, down, with, a, fair, prospect, or, a, tower, of, state, for, a, proud, mind, to, raise, itself, upon, or, a, fort, or, commanding, ground, for, strife, and, contention, or, a, shop, for, profit, or, sale, and, not, a, rich, storehouse, for, the, glory, of, the, creator, and, the, relief, of, man’s, estate, but, this, is, that, which, will, indeed, dignify, and, exalt, knowledge, if, contemplation, and, action, may, be, more, nearly, and, straitly, conjoined, and, united, together, than, they, have, been, a, conjunction, like, unto, that, of, the, two, highest, planets, saturn, the, planet, of, rest, and, contemplation, and, jupiter, the, planet, of, civil, society, and, action, howbeit, do, not, mean, when, speak, of, use, and, action, that, end, before-mentioned, of, the, applying, of, knowledge, to, lucre, and, profession, for, am, not, ignorant, how, much, that, diverteth, and, interrupteth, the, prosecution, and, advancement, of, knowledge, like, unto, the, golden, ball, thrown, before, atalanta, which, while, she, goeth, aside, and, stoopeth, to, take, up, the, race, is, hindered, “declinat, cursus, aurumque, volubile, tollit, ”, {39}, neither, is, my, meaning, as, was, spoken, of, socrates, to, call, philosophy, down, from, heaven, to, converse, upon, the, earth—that, is, to, leave, natural, philosophy, aside, and, to, apply, knowledge, only, to, manners, and, policy, but, as, both, heaven, and, earth, do, conspire, and, contribute, to, the, use, and, benefit, of, man, so, the, end, ought, to, be, from, both, philosophies, to, separate, and, reject, vain, speculations, and, whatsoever, is, empty, and, void, and, to, preserve, and, augment, whatsoever, is, solid, and, fruitful, that, knowledge, may, not, be, as, a, courtesan, for, pleasure, and, vanity, only, or, as, a, bond-woman, to, acquire, and, gain, to, her, master’s, use, but, as, a, spouse, for, generation, fruit, and, comfort, (12), thus, have, described, and, opened, as, by, a, kind, of, dissection, those, peccant, humours, (the, principal, of, them), which, have, not, only, given, impediment, to, the, proficience, of, learning, but, have, given, also, occasion, to, the, traducement, thereof, wherein, if, have, been, too, plain, it, must, be, remembered, _fidelia, vulnera, amantis_, _sed, dolosa, oscula, malignantis_, this, think, have, gained, that, ought, to, be, the, better, believed, in, that, which, shall, say, pertaining, to, commendation, because, have, proceeded, so, freely, in, that, which, concerneth, censure, and, yet, have, no, purpose, to, enter, into, a, laudative, of, learning, or, to, make, a, hymn, to, the, muses, (though, am, of, opinion, that, it, is, long, since, their, rites, were, duly, celebrated), but, my, intent, is, without, varnish, or, amplification, justly, to, weigh, the, dignity, of, knowledge, in, the, balance, with, other, things, and, to, take, the, true, value, thereof, by, testimonies, and, arguments, divine, and, human, (1), first, therefore, let, us, seek, the, dignity, of, knowledge, in, the, archetype, or, first, platform, which, is, in, the, attributes, and, acts, of, god, as, far, as, they, are, revealed, to, man, and, may, be, observed, with, sobriety, wherein, we, may, not, seek, it, by, the, name, of, learning, for, all, learning, is, knowledge, acquired, and, all, knowledge, in, god, is, original, and, therefore, we, must, look, for, it, by, another, name, that, of, wisdom, or, sapience, as, the, scriptures, call, it, (2), it, is, so, then, that, in, the, work, of, the, creation, we, see, a, double, emanation, of, virtue, from, god, the, one, referring, more, properly, to, power, the, other, to, wisdom, the, one, expressed, in, making, the, subsistence, of, the, matter, and, the, other, in, disposing, the, beauty, of, the, form, this, being, supposed, it, is, to, be, observed, that, for, anything, which, appeareth, in, the, history, of, the, creation, the, confused, mass, and, matter, of, heaven, and, earth, was, made, in, a, moment, and, the, order, and, disposition, of, that, chaos, or, mass, was, the, work, of, six, days, such, a, note, of, difference, it, pleased, god, to, put, upon, the, works, of, power, and, the, works, of, wisdom, wherewith, concurreth, that, in, the, former, it, is, not, set, down, that, god, said, “let, there, be, heaven, and, earth, ”, as, it, is, set, down, of, the, works, following, but, actually, that, god, made, heaven, and, earth, the, one, carrying, the, style, of, a, manufacture, and, the, other, of, a, law, decree, or, counsel, (3), to, proceed, to, that, which, is, next, in, order, from, god, to, spirits, we, find, as, far, as, credit, is, to, be, given, to, the, celestial, hierarchy, of, that, supposed, dionysius, the, senator, of, athens, the, first, place, or, degree, is, given, to, the, angels, of, love, which, are, termed, seraphim, the, second, to, the, angels, of, light, which, are, termed, cherubim, and, the, third, and, so, following, places, to, thrones, principalities, and, the, rest, which, are, all, angels, of, power, and, ministry, so, as, this, angels, of, knowledge, and, illumination, are, placed, before, the, angels, of, office, and, domination, (4), to, descend, from, spirits, and, intellectual, forms, to, sensible, and, material, forms, we, read, the, first, form, that, was, created, was, light, which, hath, a, relation, and, correspondence, in, nature, and, corporal, things, to, knowledge, in, spirits, and, incorporal, things, (5), so, in, the, distribution, of, days, we, see, the, day, wherein, god, did, rest, and, contemplate, his, own, works, was, blessed, above, all, the, days, wherein, he, did, effect, and, accomplish, them, (6), after, the, creation, was, finished, it, is, set, down, unto, us, that, man, was, placed, in, the, garden, to, work, therein, which, work, so, appointed, to, him, could, be, no, other, than, work, of, contemplation, that, is, when, the, end, of, work, is, but, for, exercise, and, experiment, not, for, necessity, for, there, being, then, no, reluctation, of, the, creature, nor, sweat, of, the, brow, man’s, employment, must, of, consequence, have, been, matter, of, delight, in, the, experiment, and, not, matter, of, labour, for, the, use, again, the, first, acts, which, man, performed, in, paradise, consisted, of, the, two, summary, parts, of, knowledge, the, view, of, creatures, and, the, imposition, of, names, as, for, the, knowledge, which, induced, the, fall, it, was, as, was, touched, before, not, the, natural, knowledge, of, creatures, but, the, moral, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, wherein, the, supposition, was, that, god’s, commandments, or, prohibitions, were, not, the, originals, of, good, and, evil, but, that, they, had, other, beginnings, which, man, aspired, to, know, to, the, end, to, make, a, total, defection, from, god, and, to, depend, wholly, upon, himself, (7), to, pass, on, in, the, first, event, or, occurrence, after, the, fall, of, man, we, see, (as, the, scriptures, have, infinite, mysteries, not, violating, at, all, the, truth, of, this, story, or, letter), an, image, of, the, two, estates, the, contemplative, state, and, the, active, state, figured, in, the, two, persons, of, abel, and, cain, and, in, the, two, simplest, and, most, primitive, trades, of, life, that, of, the, shepherd, (who, by, reason, of, his, leisure, rest, in, a, place, and, lying, in, view, of, heaven, is, a, lively, image, of, a, contemplative, life), and, that, of, the, husbandman, where, we, see, again, the, favour, and, election, of, god, went, to, the, shepherd, and, not, to, the, tiller, of, the, ground, (8), so, in, the, age, before, the, flood, the, holy, records, within, those, few, memorials, which, are, there, entered, and, registered, have, vouchsafed, to, mention, and, honour, the, name, of, the, inventors, and, authors, of, music, and, works, in, metal, in, the, age, after, the, flood, the, first, great, judgment, of, god, upon, the, ambition, of, man, was, the, confusion, of, tongues, whereby, the, open, trade, and, intercourse, of, learning, and, knowledge, was, chiefly, imbarred, (9), to, descend, to, moses, the, lawgiver, and, god’s, first, pen, he, is, adorned, by, the, scriptures, with, this, addition, and, commendation, “that, he, was, seen, in, all, the, learning, of, the, egyptians, ”, which, nation, we, know, was, one, of, the, most, ancient, schools, of, the, world, for, so, plato, brings, in, the, egyptian, priest, saying, unto, solon, “you, grecians, are, ever, children, you, have, no, knowledge, of, antiquity, nor, antiquity, of, knowledge, ”, take, a, view, of, the, ceremonial, law, of, moses, you, shall, find, besides, the, prefiguration, of, christ, the, badge, or, difference, of, the, people, of, god, the, exercise, and, impression, of, obedience, and, other, divine, uses, and, fruits, thereof, that, some, of, the, most, learned, rabbins, have, travailed, profitably, and, profoundly, to, observe, some, of, them, a, natural, some, of, them, a, moral, sense, or, reduction, of, many, of, the, ceremonies, and, ordinances, as, in, the, law, of, the, leprosy, where, it, is, said, “if, the, whiteness, have, overspread, the, flesh, the, patient, may, pass, abroad, for, clean, but, if, there, be, any, whole, flesh, remaining, he, is, to, be, shut, up, for, unclean, ”, one, of, them, noteth, a, principle, of, nature, that, putrefaction, is, more, contagious, before, maturity, than, after, and, another, noteth, a, position, of, moral, philosophy, that, men, abandoned, to, vice, do, not, so, much, corrupt, manners, as, those, that, are, half, good, and, half, evil, so, in, this, and, very, many, other, places, in, that, law, there, is, to, be, found, besides, the, theological, sense, much, aspersion, of, philosophy, (10), so, likewise, in, that, excellent, hook, of, job, if, it, be, revolved, with, diligence, it, will, be, found, pregnant, and, swelling, with, natural, philosophy, as, for, example, cosmography, and, the, roundness, of, the, world, _qui, extendit, aquilonem, super, vacuum_, _et, appendit, terram, super, nihilum_, wherein, the, pensileness, of, the, earth, the, pole, of, the, north, and, the, finiteness, or, convexity, of, heaven, are, manifestly, touched, so, again, matter, of, astronomy, _spiritus, ejus, ornavit, cælos_, _et, obstetricante, manu, ejus, eductus, est, coluber, tortuoses_, and, in, another, place, _nunquid, conjungere, valebis, micantes, stellas, pleiadas_, _aut, gyrum, arcturi, poteris, dissipare_, where, the, fixing, of, the, stars, ever, standing, at, equal, distance, is, with, great, elegancy, noted, and, in, another, place, _qui, facit, arcturum_, _et, oriona_, _et, hyadas_, _et, interiora, austri_, where, again, he, takes, knowledge, of, the, depression, of, the, southern, pole, calling, it, the, secrets, of, the, south, because, the, southern, stars, were, in, that, climate, unseen, matter, of, generation, _annon, sicut, lac, mulsisti, me_, _et, sicut, caseum, coagulasti, me_, &c, matter, of, minerals, _habet, argentum, venarum, suarum, principia_, _et, auro, locus, est, in, quo, conflatur_, _ferrum, de, terra, tollitur_, _et, lapis, solutus, calore, in, æs, vertitur_, and, so, forwards, in, that, chapter, (11), so, likewise, in, the, person, of, solomon, the, king, we, see, the, gift, or, endowment, of, wisdom, and, learning, both, in, solomon’s, petition, and, in, god’s, assent, thereunto, preferred, before, all, other, terrene, and, temporal, felicity, by, virtue, of, which, grant, or, donative, of, god, solomon, became, enabled, not, only, to, write, those, excellent, parables, or, aphorisms, concerning, divine, and, moral, philosophy, but, also, to, compile, a, natural, history, of, all, verdure, from, the, cedar, upon, the, mountain, to, the, moss, upon, the, wall, (which, is, but, a, rudiment, between, putrefaction, and, an, herb), and, also, of, all, things, that, breathe, or, move, nay, the, same, solomon, the, king, although, he, excelled, in, the, glory, of, treasure, and, magnificent, buildings, of, shipping, and, navigation, of, service, and, attendance, of, fame, and, renown, and, the, like, yet, he, maketh, no, claim, to, any, of, those, glories, but, only, to, the, glory, of, inquisition, of, truth, for, so, he, saith, expressly, “the, glory, of, god, is, to, conceal, a, thing, but, the, glory, of, the, king, is, to, find, it, out, ”, as, if, according, to, the, innocent, play, of, children, the, divine, majesty, took, delight, to, hide, his, works, to, the, end, to, have, them, found, out, and, as, if, kings, could, not, obtain, a, greater, honour, than, to, be, god’s, playfellows, in, that, game, considering, the, great, commandment, of, wits, and, means, whereby, nothing, needeth, to, be, hidden, from, them, (12), neither, did, the, dispensation, of, god, vary, in, the, times, after, our, saviour, came, into, the, world, for, our, saviour, himself, did, first, show, his, power, to, subdue, ignorance, by, his, conference, with, the, priests, and, doctors, of, the, law, before, he, showed, his, power, to, subdue, nature, by, his, miracles, and, the, coming, of, this, holy, spirit, was, chiefly, figured, and, expressed, in, the, similitude, and, gift, of, tongues, which, are, but, _vehicula, scientiæ_, (13), so, in, the, election, of, those, instruments, which, it, pleased, god, to, use, for, the, plantation, of, the, faith, notwithstanding, that, at, the, first, he, did, employ, persons, altogether, unlearned, otherwise, than, by, inspiration, more, evidently, to, declare, his, immediate, working, and, to, abase, all, human, wisdom, or, knowledge, yet, nevertheless, that, counsel, of, his, was, no, sooner, performed, but, in, the, next, vicissitude, and, succession, he, did, send, his, divine, truth, into, the, world, waited, on, with, other, learnings, as, with, servants, or, handmaids, for, so, we, see, st, paul, who, was, only, learned, amongst, the, apostles, had, his, pen, most, used, in, the, scriptures, of, the, new, testament, (14), so, again, we, find, that, many, of, the, ancient, bishops, and, fathers, of, the, church, were, excellently, read, and, studied, in, all, the, learning, of, this, heathen, insomuch, that, the, edict, of, the, emperor, julianus, (whereby, it, was, interdicted, unto, christians, to, be, admitted, into, schools, lectures, or, exercises, of, learning), was, esteemed, and, accounted, a, more, pernicious, engine, and, machination, against, the, christian, faith, than, were, all, the, sanguinary, prosecutions, of, his, predecessors, neither, could, the, emulation, and, jealousy, of, gregory, the, first, of, that, name, bishop, of, rome, ever, obtain, the, opinion, of, piety, or, devotion, but, contrariwise, received, the, censure, of, humour, malignity, and, pusillanimity, even, amongst, holy, men, in, that, he, designed, to, obliterate, and, extinguish, the, memory, of, heathen, antiquity, and, authors, but, contrariwise, it, was, the, christian, church, which, amidst, the, inundations, of, the, scythians, on, the, one, side, from, the, north-west, and, the, saracens, from, the, east, did, preserve, in, the, sacred, lap, and, bosom, thereof, the, precious, relics, even, of, heathen, learning, which, otherwise, had, been, extinguished, as, if, no, such, thing, had, ever, been, (15), and, we, see, before, our, eyes, that, in, the, age, of, ourselves, and, our, fathers, when, it, pleased, god, to, call, the, church, of, rome, to, account, for, their, degenerate, manners, and, ceremonies, and, sundry, doctrines, obnoxious, and, framed, to, uphold, the, same, abuses, at, one, and, the, same, time, it, was, ordained, by, the, divine, providence, that, there, should, attend, withal, a, renovation, and, new, spring, of, all, other, knowledges, and, on, the, other, side, we, see, the, jesuits, who, partly, in, themselves, and, partly, by, the, emulation, and, provocation, of, their, example, have, much, quickened, and, strengthened, the, state, of, learning, we, see, say), what, notable, service, and, reparation, they, have, done, to, the, roman, see, (16), wherefore, to, conclude, this, part, let, it, be, observed, that, there, be, two, principal, duties, and, services, besides, ornament, and, illustration, which, philosophy, and, human, learning, do, perform, to, faith, and, religion, the, one, because, they, are, an, effectual, inducement, to, the, exaltation, of, the, glory, of, god, for, as, the, psalms, and, other, scriptures, do, often, invite, us, to, consider, and, magnify, the, great, and, wonderful, works, of, god, so, if, we, should, rest, only, in, the, contemplation, of, the, exterior, of, them, as, they, first, offer, themselves, to, our, senses, we, should, do, a, like, injury, unto, the, majesty, of, god, as, if, we, should, judge, or, construe, of, the, store, of, some, excellent, jeweller, by, that, only, which, is, set, out, toward, the, street, in, his, shop, the, other, because, they, minister, a, singular, help, and, preservative, against, unbelief, and, error, for, our, saviour, saith, “you, err, not, knowing, the, scriptures, nor, the, power, of, god, ”, laying, before, us, two, books, or, volumes, to, study, if, we, will, be, secured, from, error, first, the, scriptures, revealing, the, will, of, god, and, then, the, creatures, expressing, his, power, whereof, the, latter, is, a, key, unto, the, former, not, only, opening, our, understanding, to, conceive, the, true, sense, of, the, scriptures, by, the, general, notions, of, reason, and, rules, of, speech, but, chiefly, opening, our, belief, in, drawing, us, into, a, due, meditation, of, the, omnipotency, of, god, which, is, chiefly, signed, and, engraven, upon, his, works, thus, much, therefore, for, divine, testimony, and, evidence, concerning, the, true, dignity, and, value, of, learning, (1), as, for, human, proofs, it, is, so, large, a, field, as, in, a, discourse, of, this, nature, and, brevity, it, is, fit, rather, to, use, choice, of, those, things, which, we, shall, produce, than, to, embrace, the, variety, of, them, first, therefore, in, the, degrees, of, human, honour, amongst, the, heathen, it, was, the, highest, to, obtain, to, a, veneration, and, adoration, as, a, god, this, unto, the, christians, is, as, the, forbidden, fruit, but, we, speak, now, separately, of, human, testimony, according, to, which—that, which, the, grecians, call, _apotheosis_, and, the, latins, _relatio, inter, divos_—was, the, supreme, honour, which, man, could, attribute, unto, man, specially, when, it, was, given, not, by, a, formal, decree, or, act, of, state, (as, it, was, used, among, the, roman, emperors), but, by, an, inward, assent, and, belief, which, honour, being, so, high, had, also, a, degree, or, middle, term, for, there, were, reckoned, above, human, honours, honours, heroical, and, divine, in, the, attribution, and, distribution, of, which, honours, we, see, antiquity, made, this, difference, that, whereas, founders, and, uniters, of, states, and, cities, lawgivers, extirpers, of, tyrants, fathers, of, the, people, and, other, eminent, persons, in, civil, merit, were, honoured, but, with, the, titles, of, worthies, or, demigods, such, as, were, hercules, theseus, minus, romulus, and, the, like, on, the, other, side, such, as, were, inventors, and, authors, of, new, arts, endowments, and, commodities, towards, man’s, life, were, ever, consecrated, amongst, the, gods, themselves, as, was, ceres, bacchus, mercurius, apollo, and, others, and, justly, for, the, merit, of, the, former, is, confined, within, the, circle, of, an, age, or, a, nation, and, is, like, fruitful, showers, which, though, they, be, profitable, and, good, yet, serve, but, for, that, season, and, for, a, latitude, of, ground, where, they, fall, but, the, other, is, indeed, like, the, benefits, of, heaven, which, are, permanent, and, universal, the, former, again, is, mixed, with, strife, and, perturbation, but, the, latter, hath, the, true, character, of, divine, presence, coming, in, _aura, leni_, without, noise, or, agitation, (2), neither, is, certainly, that, other, merit, of, learning, in, repressing, the, inconveniences, which, grow, from, man, to, man, much, inferior, to, the, former, of, relieving, the, necessities, which, arise, from, nature, which, merit, was, lively, set, forth, by, the, ancients, in, that, feigned, relation, of, orpheus’, theatre, where, all, beasts, and, birds, assembled, and, forgetting, their, several, appetites—some, of, prey, some, of, game, some, of, quarrel—stood, all, sociably, together, listening, unto, the, airs, and, accords, of, the, harp, the, sound, whereof, no, sooner, ceased, or, was, drowned, by, some, louder, noise, but, every, beast, returned, to, his, own, nature, wherein, is, aptly, described, the, nature, and, condition, of, men, who, are, full, of, savage, and, unreclaimed, desires, of, profit, of, lust, of, revenge, which, as, long, as, they, give, ear, to, precepts, to, laws, to, religion, sweetly, touched, with, eloquence, and, persuasion, of, books, of, sermons, of, harangues, so, long, is, society, and, peace, maintained, but, if, these, instruments, be, silent, or, that, sedition, and, tumult, make, them, not, audible, all, things, dissolve, into, anarchy, and, confusion, (3), but, this, appeareth, more, manifestly, when, kings, themselves, or, persons, of, authority, under, them, or, other, governors, in, commonwealths, and, popular, estates, are, endued, with, learning, for, although, he, might, be, thought, partial, to, his, own, profession, that, said, “then, should, people, and, estates, be, happy, when, either, kings, were, philosophers, or, philosophers, kings, ”, yet, so, much, is, verified, by, experience, that, under, learned, princes, and, governors, there, have, been, ever, the, best, times, for, howsoever, kings, may, have, their, imperfections, in, their, passions, and, customs, yet, if, they, be, illuminate, by, learning, they, have, those, notions, of, religion, policy, and, morality, which, do, preserve, them, and, refrain, them, from, all, ruinous, and, peremptory, errors, and, excesses, whispering, evermore, in, their, ears, when, counsellors, and, servants, stand, mute, and, silent, and, senators, or, counsellors, likewise, which, be, learned, to, proceed, upon, more, safe, and, substantial, principles, than, counsellors, which, are, only, men, of, experience, the, one, sort, keeping, dangers, afar, off, whereas, the, other, discover, them, not, till, they, come, near, hand, and, then, trust, to, the, agility, of, their, wit, to, ward, or, avoid, them, (4), which, felicity, of, times, under, learned, princes, (to, keep, still, the, law, of, brevity, by, using, the, most, eminent, and, selected, examples), doth, best, appear, in, the, age, which, passed, from, the, death, of, domitianus, the, emperor, until, the, reign, of, commodus, comprehending, a, succession, of, six, princes, all, learned, or, singular, favourers, and, advancers, of, learning, which, age, for, temporal, respects, was, the, most, happy, and, flourishing, that, ever, the, roman, empire, (which, then, was, a, model, of, the, world), enjoyed—a, matter, revealed, and, prefigured, unto, domitian, in, a, dream, the, night, before, he, was, slain, for, he, thought, there, was, grown, behind, upon, his, shoulders, a, neck, and, a, head, of, gold, which, came, accordingly, to, pass, in, those, golden, times, which, succeeded, of, which, princes, we, will, make, some, commemoration, wherein, although, the, matter, will, be, vulgar, and, may, be, thought, fitter, for, a, declamation, than, agreeable, to, a, treatise, infolded, as, this, is, yet, because, it, is, pertinent, to, the, point, in, hand—_neque, semper, arcum, tendit, apollo_—and, to, name, them, only, were, too, naked, and, cursory, will, not, omit, it, altogether, the, first, was, nerva, the, excellent, temper, of, whose, government, is, by, a, glance, in, cornelius, tacitus, touched, to, the, life, _postquam, divus, nerva, res, oluim, insociabiles, miscuisset_, _imperium, et, libertatem_, and, in, token, of, his, learning, the, last, act, of, his, short, reign, left, to, memory, was, a, missive, to, his, adopted, son, trajan, proceeding, upon, some, inward, discontent, at, the, ingratitude, of, the, times, comprehended, in, a, verse, of, homer’s—, “telis, phœbe, tuis, lacrymas, ulciscere, nostras, ”, (5), trajan, who, succeeded, was, for, his, person, not, learned, but, if, we, will, hearken, to, the, speech, of, our, saviour, that, saith, “he, that, receiveth, a, prophet, in, the, name, of, a, prophet, shall, have, a, prophet’s, reward, ”, he, deserveth, to, be, placed, amongst, the, most, learned, princes, for, there, was, not, a, greater, admirer, of, learning, or, benefactor, of, learning, a, founder, of, famous, libraries, a, perpetual, advancer, of, learned, men, to, office, and, familiar, converser, with, learned, professors, and, preceptors, who, were, noted, to, have, then, most, credit, in, court, on, the, other, side, how, much, trajan’s, virtue, and, government, was, admired, and, renowned, surely, no, testimony, of, grave, and, faithful, history, doth, more, lively, set, forth, than, that, legend, tale, of, gregorius, magnum, bishop, of, rome, who, was, noted, for, the, extreme, envy, he, bare, towards, all, heathen, excellency, and, yet, he, is, reported, out, of, the, love, and, estimation, of, trajan’s, moral, virtues, to, have, made, unto, god, passionate, and, fervent, prayers, for, the, delivery, of, his, soul, out, of, hell, and, to, have, obtained, it, with, a, caveat, that, he, should, make, no, more, such, petitions, in, this, prince’s, time, also, the, persecutions, against, the, christians, received, intermission, upon, the, certificate, of, plinius, secundus, a, man, of, excellent, learning, and, by, trajan, advanced, (6), adrian, his, successor, was, the, most, curious, man, that, lived, and, the, most, universal, inquirer, insomuch, as, it, was, noted, for, an, error, in, his, mind, that, he, desired, to, comprehend, all, things, and, not, to, reserve, himself, for, the, worthiest, things, falling, into, the, like, humour, that, was, long, before, noted, in, philip, of, macedon, who, when, he, would, needs, overrule, and, put, down, an, excellent, musician, in, an, argument, touching, music, was, well, answered, by, him, again—“god, forbid, sir, ”, saith, he, “that, your, fortune, should, be, so, bad, as, to, know, these, things, better, than, ”, it, pleased, god, likewise, to, use, the, curiosity, of, this, emperor, as, an, inducement, to, the, peace, of, his, church, in, those, days, for, having, christ, in, veneration, not, as, a, god, or, saviour, but, as, a, wonder, or, novelty, and, having, his, picture, in, his, gallery, matched, with, apollonius, (with, whom, in, his, vain, imagination, he, thought, its, had, some, conformity), yet, it, served, the, turn, to, allay, the, bitter, hatred, of, those, times, against, the, christian, name, so, as, the, church, had, peace, during, his, time, and, for, his, government, civil, although, he, did, not, attain, to, that, of, trajan’s, in, glory, of, arms, or, perfection, of, justice, yet, in, deserving, of, the, weal, of, the, subject, he, did, exceed, him, for, trajan, erected, many, famous, monuments, and, buildings, insomuch, as, constantine, the, great, in, emulation, was, wont, to, call, him, _parietaria_, “wall-flower, ”, because, his, name, was, upon, so, many, walls, but, his, buildings, and, works, were, more, of, glory, and, triumph, than, use, and, necessity, but, adrian, spent, his, whole, reign, which, was, peaceable, in, a, perambulation, or, survey, of, the, roman, empire, giving, order, and, making, assignation, where, he, went, for, re-edifying, of, cities, towns, and, forts, decayed, and, for, cutting, of, rivers, and, streams, and, for, making, bridges, and, passages, and, for, policing, of, cities, and, commonalties, with, new, ordinances, and, constitutions, and, granting, new, franchises, and, incorporations, so, that, his, whole, time, was, a, very, restoration, of, all, the, lapses, and, decays, of, former, times, (7), antoninus, pius, who, succeeded, him, was, a, prince, excellently, learned, and, had, the, patient, and, subtle, wit, of, a, schoolman, insomuch, as, in, common, speech, (which, leaves, no, virtue, untaxed), he, was, called, _cymini, sector_, a, carver, or, a, divider, of, cummin, seed, which, is, one, of, the, least, seeds, such, a, patience, he, had, and, settled, spirit, to, enter, into, the, least, and, most, exact, differences, of, causes, a, fruit, no, doubt, of, the, exceeding, tranquillity, and, serenity, of, his, mind, which, being, no, ways, charged, or, encumbered, either, with, fears, remorses, or, scruples, but, having, been, noted, for, a, man, of, the, purest, goodness, without, all, fiction, or, affectation, that, hath, reigned, or, lived, made, his, mind, continually, present, and, entire, he, likewise, approached, a, degree, nearer, unto, christianity, and, became, as, agrippa, said, unto, st, paul, “half, a, christian, ”, holding, their, religion, and, law, in, good, opinion, and, not, only, ceasing, persecution, but, giving, way, to, the, advancement, of, christians, (5), there, succeeded, him, the, first, _divi, fratres_, the, two, adoptive, brethren—lucius, commodus, verus, son, to, ælius, verus, who, delighted, much, in, the, softer, kind, of, learning, and, was, wont, to, call, the, poet, martial, his, virgil, and, marcus, aurelius, antoninus, whereof, the, latter, who, obscured, his, colleague, and, survived, him, long, was, named, the, “philosopher, ”, who, as, he, excelled, all, the, rest, in, learning, so, he, excelled, them, likewise, in, perfection, of, all, royal, virtues, insomuch, as, julianus, the, emperor, in, his, book, entitled, _cærsares_, being, as, a, pasquil, or, satire, to, deride, all, his, predecessors, feigned, that, they, were, all, invited, to, a, banquet, of, the, gods, and, silenus, the, jester, sat, at, the, nether, end, of, the, table, and, bestowed, a, scoff, on, everyone, as, they, came, in, but, when, marcus, philosophus, came, in, silenus, was, gravelled, and, out, of, countenance, not, knowing, where, to, carp, at, him, save, at, the, last, he, gave, a, glance, at, his, patience, towards, his, wife, and, the, virtue, of, this, prince, continued, with, that, of, his, predecessor, made, the, name, of, antoninus, so, sacred, in, the, world, that, though, it, were, extremely, dishonoured, in, commodus, caracalla, and, heliogabalus, who, all, bare, the, name, yet, when, alexander, severus, refused, the, name, because, he, was, a, stranger, to, the, family, the, senate, with, one, acclamation, said, _quomodo, augustus_, _sic, et, antoninus_, in, such, renown, and, veneration, was, the, name, of, these, two, princes, in, those, days, that, they, would, have, had, it, as, a, perpetual, addition, in, all, the, emperors’, style, in, this, emperor’s, time, also, the, church, for, the, most, part, was, in, peace, so, as, in, this, sequence, of, six, princes, we, do, see, the, blessed, effects, of, learning, in, sovereignty, painted, forth, in, the, greatest, table, of, the, world, (9), but, for, a, tablet, or, picture, of, smaller, volume, (not, presuming, to, speak, of, your, majesty, that, liveth), in, my, judgment, the, most, excellent, is, that, of, queen, elizabeth, your, immediate, predecessor, in, this, part, of, britain, a, prince, that, if, plutarch, were, now, alive, to, write, lives, by, parallels, would, trouble, him, think, to, find, for, her, a, parallel, amongst, women, this, lady, was, endued, with, learning, in, her, sex, singular, and, rare, even, amongst, masculine, princes—whether, we, speak, of, learning, of, language, or, of, science, modern, or, ancient, divinity, or, humanity—and, unto, the, very, last, year, of, her, life, she, accustomed, to, appoint, set, hours, for, reading, scarcely, any, young, student, in, a, university, more, daily, or, more, duly, as, for, her, government, assure, myself, shall, not, exceed, if, do, affirm), that, this, part, of, the, island, never, had, forty-five, years, of, better, tines, and, yet, not, through, the, calmness, of, the, season, but, through, the, wisdom, of, her, regiment, for, if, there, be, considered, of, the, one, side, the, truth, of, religion, established, the, constant, peace, and, security, the, good, administration, of, justice, the, temperate, use, of, the, prerogative, not, slackened, nor, much, strained, the, flourishing, state, of, learning, sortable, to, so, excellent, a, patroness, the, convenient, estate, of, wealth, and, means, both, of, crown, and, subject, the, habit, of, obedience, and, the, moderation, of, discontents, and, there, be, considered, on, the, other, side, the, differences, of, religion, the, troubles, of, neighbour, countries, the, ambition, of, spain, and, opposition, of, rome, and, then, that, she, was, solitary, and, of, herself, these, things, say, considered, as, could, not, have, chosen, an, instance, so, recent, and, so, proper, so, suppose, could, not, have, chosen, one, more, remarkable, or, eminent, to, the, purpose, now, in, hand, which, is, concerning, the, conjunction, of, learning, in, the, prince, with, felicity, in, the, people, (10), neither, hath, learning, an, influence, and, operation, only, upon, civil, merit, and, moral, virtue, and, the, arts, or, temperature, of, peace, and, peaceable, government, but, likewise, it, hath, no, less, power, and, efficacy, in, enablement, towards, martial, and, military, virtue, and, prowess, as, may, be, notably, represented, in, the, examples, of, alexander, the, great, and, cæsar, the, dictator, (mentioned, before, but, now, in, fit, place, to, be, resumed), of, whose, virtues, and, acts, in, war, there, needs, no, note, or, recital, having, been, the, wonders, of, time, in, that, kind, but, of, their, affections, towards, learning, and, perfections, in, learning, it, is, pertinent, to, say, somewhat, (11), alexander, was, bred, and, taught, under, aristotle, the, great, philosopher, who, dedicated, divers, of, his, books, of, philosophy, unto, him, he, was, attended, with, callisthenes, and, divers, other, learned, persons, that, followed, him, in, camp, throughout, his, journeys, and, conquests, what, price, and, estimation, he, had, learning, in, doth, notably, appear, in, these, three, particulars, first, in, the, envy, he, used, to, express, that, he, bare, towards, achilles, in, this, that, he, had, so, good, a, trumpet, of, his, praises, as, homer’s, verses, secondly, in, the, judgment, or, solution, he, gave, touching, that, precious, cabinet, of, darius, which, was, found, among, his, jewels, (whereof, question, was, made, what, thing, was, worthy, to, be, put, into, it, and, he, gave, his, opinion, for, homer’s, works), thirdly, in, his, letter, to, aristotle, after, he, had, set, forth, his, books, of, nature, wherein, he, expostulateth, with, him, for, publishing, the, secrets, or, mysteries, of, philosophy, and, gave, him, to, understand, that, himself, esteemed, it, more, to, excel, other, men, in, learning, and, knowledge, than, in, power, and, empire, and, what, use, he, had, of, learning, doth, appear, or, rather, shine, in, all, his, speeches, and, answers, being, full, of, science, and, use, of, science, and, that, in, all, variety, (12), and, herein, again, it, may, seem, a, thing, scholastical, and, somewhat, idle, to, recite, things, that, every, man, knoweth, but, yet, since, the, argument, handle, leadeth, me, thereunto, am, glad, that, men, shall, perceive, am, as, willing, to, flatter, (if, they, will, so, call, it), an, alexander, or, a, cæsar, or, an, antoninus, that, are, dead, many, hundred, years, since, as, any, that, now, liveth, for, it, is, the, displaying, of, the, glory, of, learning, in, sovereignty, that, propound, to, myself, and, not, a, humour, of, declaiming, in, any, man’s, praises, observe, then, the, speech, he, used, of, diogenes, and, see, if, it, tend, not, to, the, true, state, of, one, of, the, greatest, questions, of, moral, philosophy, whether, the, enjoying, of, outward, things, or, the, contemning, of, them, be, the, greatest, happiness, for, when, he, saw, diogenes, so, perfectly, contented, with, so, little, he, said, to, those, that, mocked, at, his, condition, “were, not, alexander, would, wish, to, be, diogenes, ”, but, seneca, inverteth, it, and, saith, “_plus, erat_, _quod, hic, nollet, accipere_, _quàm, quod, ille, posset, dare_, ”, there, were, more, things, which, diogenes, would, have, refused, than, those, were, which, alexander, could, have, given, or, enjoyed, (13), observe, again, that, speech, which, was, usual, with, him, —“that, he, felt, his, mortality, chiefly, in, two, things, sleep, and, lust, ”, and, see, if, it, were, not, a, speech, extracted, out, of, the, depth, of, natural, philosophy, and, liker, to, have, come, out, of, the, mouth, of, aristotle, or, democritus, than, from, alexander, (14), see, again, that, speech, of, humanity, and, poesy, when, upon, the, bleeding, of, his, wounds, he, called, unto, him, one, of, his, flatterers, that, was, wont, to, ascribe, to, him, divine, honour, and, said, “look, this, is, very, blood, this, is, not, such, a, liquor, as, homer, speaketh, of, which, ran, from, venus’, hand, when, it, was, pierced, by, diomedes, ”, (15), see, likewise, his, readiness, in, reprehension, of, logic, in, the, speech, he, used, to, cassander, upon, a, complaint, that, was, made, against, his, father, antipater, for, when, alexander, happened, to, say, “do, you, think, these, men, would, have, come, from, so, far, to, complain, except, they, had, just, cause, of, grief, ”, and, cassander, answered, “yea, that, was, the, matter, because, they, thought, they, should, not, be, disproved, ”, said, alexander, laughing, “see, the, subtleties, of, aristotle, to, take, a, matter, both, ways, _pro, et, contra_, &c, ”, (16), but, note, again, how, well, he, could, use, the, same, art, which, he, reprehended, to, serve, his, own, humour, when, bearing, a, secret, grudge, to, callisthenes, because, he, was, against, the, new, ceremony, of, his, adoration, feasting, one, night, where, the, same, callisthenes, was, at, the, table, it, was, moved, by, some, after, supper, for, entertainment, sake, that, callisthenes, who, was, an, eloquent, man, might, speak, of, some, theme, or, purpose, at, his, own, choice, which, callisthenes, did, choosing, the, praise, of, the, macedonian, nation, for, his, discourse, and, performing, the, same, with, so, good, manner, as, the, hearers, were, much, ravished, whereupon, alexander, nothing, pleased, said, “it, was, easy, to, be, eloquent, upon, so, good, a, subject, but, ”, saith, he, “turn, your, style, and, let, us, hear, what, you, can, say, against, us, ”, which, callisthenes, presently, undertook, and, did, with, that, sting, and, life, that, alexander, interrupted, him, and, said, “the, goodness, of, the, cause, made, him, eloquent, before, and, despite, made, him, eloquent, then, again, ”, (17), consider, further, for, tropes, of, rhetoric, that, excellent, use, of, a, metaphor, or, translation, wherewith, he, taxeth, antipater, who, was, an, imperious, and, tyrannous, governor, for, when, one, of, antipater’s, friends, commended, him, to, alexander, for, his, moderation, that, he, did, not, degenerate, as, his, other, lieutenants, did, into, the, persian, pride, in, uses, of, purple, but, kept, the, ancient, habit, of, macedon, of, black, “true, ”, saith, alexander, “but, antipater, is, all, purple, within, ”, or, that, other, when, parmenio, came, to, him, in, the, plain, of, arbela, and, showed, him, the, innumerable, multitude, of, his, enemies, specially, as, they, appeared, by, the, infinite, number, of, lights, as, it, had, been, a, new, firmament, of, stars, and, thereupon, advised, him, to, assail, them, by, night, whereupon, he, answered, “that, he, would, not, steal, the, victory, ”, (18), for, matter, of, policy, weigh, that, significant, distinction, so, much, in, all, ages, embraced, that, he, made, between, his, two, friends, hephæstion, and, craterus, when, he, said, “that, the, one, loved, alexander, and, the, other, loved, the, king, ”, describing, the, principal, difference, of, princes’, best, servants, that, some, in, affection, love, their, person, and, other, in, duty, love, their, crown, (19), weigh, also, that, excellent, taxation, of, an, error, ordinary, with, counsellors, of, princes, that, they, counsel, their, masters, according, to, the, model, of, their, own, mind, and, fortune, and, not, of, their, masters, when, upon, darius’, great, offers, parmenio, had, said, “surely, would, accept, these, offers, were, as, alexander, ”, saith, alexander, “so, would, were, as, parmenio, ”, (20), lastly, weigh, that, quick, and, acute, reply, which, he, made, when, he, gave, so, large, gifts, to, his, friends, and, servants, and, was, asked, what, he, did, reserve, for, himself, and, he, answered, “hope, ”, weigh, say, whether, he, had, not, cast, up, his, account, aright, because, _hope_, must, be, the, portion, of, all, that, resolve, upon, great, enterprises, for, this, was, cæsar’s, portion, when, he, went, first, into, gaul, his, estate, being, then, utterly, overthrown, with, largesses, and, this, was, likewise, the, portion, of, that, noble, prince, howsoever, transported, with, ambition, henry, duke, of, guise, of, whom, it, was, usually, said, that, he, was, the, greatest, usurer, in, france, because, he, had, turned, all, his, estate, into, obligations, (21), to, conclude, therefore, as, certain, critics, are, used, to, say, hyperbolically, “that, if, all, sciences, were, lost, they, might, be, found, in, virgil, ”, so, certainly, this, may, be, said, truly, there, are, the, prints, and, footsteps, of, learning, in, those, few, speeches, which, are, reported, of, this, prince, the, admiration, of, whom, when, consider, him, not, as, alexander, the, great, but, as, aristotle’s, scholar, hath, carried, me, too, far, (22), as, for, julius, cæsar, the, excellency, of, his, learning, needeth, not, to, be, argued, from, his, education, or, his, company, or, his, speeches, but, in, a, further, degree, doth, declare, itself, in, his, writings, and, works, whereof, some, are, extant, and, permanent, and, some, unfortunately, perished, for, first, we, see, there, is, left, unto, us, that, excellent, history, of, his, own, wars, which, he, entitled, only, a, commentary, wherein, all, succeeding, times, have, admired, the, solid, weight, of, matter, and, the, real, passages, and, lively, images, of, actions, and, persons, expressed, in, the, greatest, propriety, of, words, and, perspicuity, of, narration, that, ever, was, which, that, it, was, not, the, effect, of, a, natural, gift, but, of, learning, and, precept, is, well, witnessed, by, that, work, of, his, entitled, _de, analogia_, being, a, grammatical, philosophy, wherein, he, did, labour, to, make, this, same, _vox, ad, placitum_, to, become, _vox, ad, licitum_, and, to, reduce, custom, of, speech, to, congruity, of, speech, and, took, as, it, were, the, pictures, of, words, from, the, life, of, reason, (23), so, we, receive, from, him, as, a, monument, both, of, his, power, and, learning, the, then, reformed, computation, of, the, year, well, expressing, that, he, took, it, to, be, as, great, a, glory, to, himself, to, observe, and, know, the, law, of, the, heavens, as, to, give, law, to, men, upon, the, earth, (24), so, likewise, in, that, book, of, his, _anti-cato_, it, may, easily, appear, that, he, did, aspire, as, well, to, victory, of, wit, as, victory, of, war, undertaking, therein, a, conflict, against, the, greatest, champion, with, the, pen, that, then, lived, cicero, the, orator, (25), so, again, in, his, book, of, apophthegms, which, he, collected, we, see, that, he, esteemed, it, more, honour, to, make, himself, but, a, pair, of, tables, to, take, the, wise, and, pithy, words, of, others, than, to, have, every, word, of, his, own, to, be, made, an, apophthegm, or, an, oracle, as, vain, princes, by, custom, of, flattery, pretend, to, do, and, yet, if, should, enumerate, divers, of, his, speeches, as, did, those, of, alexander, they, are, truly, such, as, solomon, noteth, when, he, saith, _verba, sapientum, tanquam, aculei_, _et, tanquam, clavi, in, altum, defixi_, whereof, will, only, recite, three, not, so, delectable, for, elegancy, but, admirable, for, vigour, and, efficacy, (26), as, first, it, is, reason, he, be, thought, a, master, of, words, that, could, with, one, word, appease, a, mutiny, in, his, army, which, was, thus, the, romans, when, their, generals, did, speak, to, their, army, did, use, the, word, _milites_, but, when, the, magistrates, spake, to, the, people, they, did, use, the, word, _quirites_, the, soldiers, were, in, tumult, and, seditiously, prayed, to, be, cashiered, not, that, they, so, meant, but, by, expostulation, thereof, to, draw, cæsar, to, other, conditions, wherein, he, being, resolute, not, to, give, way, after, some, silence, he, began, his, speech, _ego, quirites_, which, did, admit, them, already, cashiered—wherewith, they, were, so, surprised, crossed, and, confused, as, they, would, not, suffer, him, to, go, on, in, his, speech, but, relinquished, their, demands, and, made, it, their, suit, to, be, again, called, by, the, name, of, _milites_, (27), the, second, speech, was, thus, cæsar, did, extremely, affect, the, name, of, king, and, some, were, set, on, as, he, passed, by, in, popular, acclamation, to, salute, him, king, whereupon, finding, the, cry, weak, and, poor, he, put, it, off, thus, in, a, kind, of, jest, as, if, they, had, mistaken, his, surname, _non, rex, sum_, _sed, cæsar_, a, speech, that, if, it, be, searched, the, life, and, fulness, of, it, can, scarce, be, expressed, for, first, it, was, a, refusal, of, the, name, but, yet, not, serious, again, it, did, signify, an, infinite, confidence, and, magnanimity, as, if, he, presumed, cæsar, was, the, greater, title, as, by, his, worthiness, it, is, come, to, pass, till, this, day, but, chiefly, it, was, a, speech, of, great, allurement, toward, his, own, purpose, as, if, the, state, did, strive, with, him, but, for, a, name, whereof, mean, families, were, vested, for, _rex_, was, a, surname, with, the, romans, as, well, as, _king_, is, with, us, (28), the, last, speech, which, will, mention, was, used, to, metellus, when, cæsar, after, war, declared, did, possess, himself, of, this, city, of, rome, at, which, time, entering, into, the, inner, treasury, to, take, the, money, there, accumulate, metellus, being, tribune, forbade, him, whereto, cæsar, said, “that, if, he, did, not, desist, he, would, lay, him, dead, in, the, place, ”, and, presently, taking, himself, up, he, added, “young, man, it, is, harder, for, me, to, speak, it, than, to, do, it—_adolescens_, _durius, est, mihi, hoc, dicere, quàm, facere_, ”, speech, compounded, of, the, greatest, terror, and, greatest, clemency, that, could, proceed, out, of, the, mouth, of, man, (29), but, to, return, and, conclude, with, him, it, is, evident, himself, knew, well, his, own, perfection, in, learning, and, took, it, upon, him, as, appeared, when, upon, occasion, that, some, spake, what, a, strange, resolution, it, was, in, lucius, sylla, to, resign, his, dictators, he, scoffing, at, him, to, his, own, advantage, answered, “that, sylla, could, not, skill, of, letters, and, therefore, knew, not, how, to, dictate, ”, (30), and, here, it, were, fit, to, leave, this, point, touching, the, concurrence, of, military, virtue, and, learning, (for, what, example, should, come, with, any, grace, after, those, two, of, alexander, and, cæsar, ), were, it, not, in, regard, of, the, rareness, of, circumstance, that, find, in, one, other, particular, as, that, which, did, so, suddenly, pass, from, extreme, scorn, to, extreme, wonder, and, it, is, of, xenophon, the, philosopher, who, went, from, socrates’, school, into, asia, in, the, expedition, of, cyrus, the, younger, against, king, artaxerxes, this, xenophon, at, that, time, was, very, young, and, never, had, seen, the, wars, before, neither, had, any, command, in, the, army, but, only, followed, the, war, as, a, voluntary, for, the, love, and, conversation, of, proxenus, his, friend, he, was, present, when, falinus, came, in, message, from, the, great, king, to, the, grecians, after, that, cyrus, was, slain, in, the, field, and, they, a, handful, of, men, left, to, themselves, in, the, midst, of, the, king’s, territories, cut, off, from, their, country, by, many, navigable, rivers, and, many, hundred, miles, the, message, imported, that, they, should, deliver, up, their, arms, and, submit, themselves, to, the, king’s, mercy, to, which, message, before, answer, was, made, divers, of, the, army, conferred, familiarly, with, falinus, and, amongst, the, rest, xenophon, happened, to, say, “why, falinus, we, have, now, but, these, two, things, left, our, arms, and, our, virtue, and, if, we, yield, up, our, arms, how, shall, we, make, use, of, our, virtue, ”, whereto, falinus, smiling, on, him, said, “if, be, not, deceived, young, gentleman, you, are, an, athenian, and, believe, you, study, philosophy, and, it, is, pretty, that, you, say, but, you, are, much, abused, if, you, think, your, virtue, can, withstand, the, king’s, power, ”, here, was, the, scorn, the, wonder, followed, which, was, that, this, young, scholar, or, philosopher, after, all, the, captains, were, murdered, in, parley, by, treason, conducted, those, ten, thousand, foot, through, the, heart, of, all, the, king’s, high, countries, from, babylon, to, græcia, in, safety, in, despite, of, all, the, king’s, forces, to, the, astonishment, of, the, world, and, the, encouragement, of, the, grecians, in, times, succeeding, to, make, invasion, upon, the, kings, of, persia, as, was, after, purposed, by, jason, the, thessalian, attempted, by, agesilaus, the, spartan, and, achieved, by, alexander, the, macedonian, all, upon, the, ground, of, the, act, of, that, young, scholar, (1), to, proceed, now, from, imperial, and, military, virtue, to, moral, and, private, virtue, first, it, is, an, assured, truth, which, is, contained, in, the, verses, —, “scilicet, ingenuas, didicisse, fideliter, artes, emollit, mores, nec, sinit, esse, feros, ”, it, taketh, away, the, wildness, and, barbarism, and, fierceness, of, men’s, minds, but, indeed, the, accent, had, need, be, upon, _fideliter_, for, a, little, superficial, learning, doth, rather, work, a, contrary, effect, it, taketh, away, all, levity, temerity, and, insolency, by, copious, suggestion, of, all, doubts, and, difficulties, and, acquainting, the, mind, to, balance, reasons, on, both, sides, and, to, turn, back, the, first, offers, and, conceits, of, the, mind, and, to, accept, of, nothing, but, examined, and, tried, it, taketh, away, vain, admiration, of, anything, which, is, the, root, of, all, weakness, for, all, things, are, admired, either, because, they, are, new, or, because, they, are, great, for, novelty, no, man, that, wadeth, in, learning, or, contemplation, thoroughly, but, will, find, that, printed, in, his, heart, _nil, novi, super, terram_, neither, can, any, man, marvel, at, the, play, of, puppets, that, goeth, behind, the, curtain, and, adviseth, well, of, the, motion, and, for, magnitude, as, alexander, the, great, after, that, he, was, used, to, great, armies, and, the, great, conquests, of, the, spacious, provinces, in, asia, when, he, received, letters, out, of, greece, of, some, fights, and, services, there, which, were, commonly, for, a, passage, or, a, fort, or, some, walled, town, at, the, most, he, said, —“it, seemed, to, him, that, he, was, advertised, of, the, battles, of, the, frogs, and, the, mice, that, the, old, tales, went, of, ”, so, certainly, if, a, man, meditate, much, upon, the, universal, frame, of, nature, the, earth, with, men, upon, it, (the, divineness, of, souls, except), will, not, seem, much, other, than, an, ant-hill, whereas, some, ants, carry, corn, and, some, carry, their, young, and, some, go, empty, and, all, to, and, fro, a, little, heap, of, dust, it, taketh, away, or, mitigateth, fear, of, death, or, adverse, fortune, which, is, one, of, the, greatest, impediments, of, virtue, and, imperfections, of, manners, for, if, a, man’s, mind, be, deeply, seasoned, with, the, consideration, of, the, mortality, and, corruptible, nature, of, things, he, will, easily, concur, with, epictetus, who, went, forth, one, day, and, saw, a, woman, weeping, for, her, pitcher, of, earth, that, was, broken, and, went, forth, the, next, day, and, saw, a, woman, weeping, for, her, son, that, was, dead, and, thereupon, said, “_heri, vidi, fragilem, frangi_, _hodie, vidi, mortalem, mori_, ”, and, therefore, virgil, did, excellently, and, profoundly, couple, the, knowledge, of, causes, and, the, conquest, of, all, fears, together, as, _concomitantia_, “felix, qui, potuit, rerum, cognoscere, causas, quique, metus, omnes, et, inexorabile, fatum, subjecit, pedibus, strepitumque, acherontis, avari, ”, (2), it, were, too, long, to, go, over, the, particular, remedies, which, learning, doth, minister, to, all, the, diseases, of, the, mind, sometimes, purging, the, ill, humours, sometimes, opening, the, obstructions, sometimes, helping, digestion, sometimes, increasing, appetite, sometimes, healing, the, wounds, and, exulcerations, thereof, and, the, like, and, therefore, will, conclude, with, that, which, hath, _rationem, totius_—which, is, that, it, disposeth, the, constitution, of, the, mind, not, to, be, fixed, or, settled, in, the, defects, thereof, but, still, to, be, capable, and, susceptible, of, growth, and, reformation, for, the, unlearned, man, knows, not, what, it, is, to, descend, into, himself, or, to, call, himself, to, account, nor, the, pleasure, of, that, _suavissima, vita_, _indies, sentire, se, fieri, meliorem_, the, good, parts, he, hath, he, will, learn, to, show, to, the, full, and, use, them, dexterously, but, not, much, to, increase, them, the, faults, he, hath, he, will, learn, how, to, hide, and, colour, them, but, not, much, to, amend, them, like, an, ill, mower, that, mows, on, still, and, never, whets, his, scythe, whereas, with, the, learned, man, it, fares, otherwise, that, he, doth, ever, intermix, the, correction, and, amendment, of, his, mind, with, the, use, and, employment, thereof, nay, further, in, general, and, in, sum, certain, it, is, that, _veritas_, and, _bonitas_, differ, but, as, the, seal, and, the, print, for, truth, prints, goodness, and, they, be, the, clouds, of, error, which, descend, in, the, storms, of, passions, and, perturbations, (3), from, moral, virtue, let, us, pass, on, to, matter, of, power, and, commandment, and, consider, whether, in, right, reason, there, be, any, comparable, with, that, wherewith, knowledge, investeth, and, crowneth, man’s, nature, we, see, the, dignity, of, the, commandment, is, according, to, the, dignity, of, the, commanded, to, have, commandment, over, beasts, as, herdmen, have, is, a, thing, contemptible, to, have, commandment, over, children, as, schoolmasters, have, is, a, matter, of, small, honour, to, have, commandment, over, galley-slaves, is, a, disparagement, rather, than, an, honour, neither, is, the, commandment, of, tyrants, much, better, over, people, which, have, put, off, the, generosity, of, their, minds, and, therefore, it, was, ever, holden, that, honours, in, free, monarchies, and, commonwealths, had, a, sweetness, more, than, in, tyrannies, because, the, commandment, extendeth, more, over, the, wills, of, men, and, not, only, over, their, deeds, and, services, and, therefore, when, virgil, putteth, himself, forth, to, attribute, to, augustus, cæsar, the, best, of, human, honours, he, doth, it, in, these, words, —, “victorque, volentes, per, populos, dat, jura, viamque, affectat, olympo, ”, but, yet, the, commandment, of, knowledge, is, yet, higher, than, the, commandment, over, the, will, for, it, is, a, commandment, over, the, reason, belief, and, understanding, of, man, which, is, the, highest, part, of, the, mind, and, giveth, law, to, the, will, itself, for, there, is, no, power, on, earth, which, setteth, up, a, throne, or, chair, of, estate, in, the, spirits, and, souls, of, men, and, in, their, cogitations, imaginations, opinions, and, beliefs, but, knowledge, and, learning, and, therefore, we, see, the, detestable, and, extreme, pleasure, that, arch-heretics, and, false, prophets, and, impostors, are, transported, with, when, they, once, find, in, themselves, that, they, have, a, superiority, in, the, faith, and, conscience, of, men, so, great, as, if, they, have, once, tasted, of, it, it, is, seldom, seen, that, any, torture, or, persecution, can, make, them, relinquish, or, abandon, it, but, as, this, is, that, which, the, author, of, the, revelation, calleth, the, depth, or, profoundness, of, satan, so, by, argument, of, contraries, the, just, and, lawful, sovereignty, over, men’s, understanding, by, force, of, truth, rightly, interpreted, is, that, which, approacheth, nearest, to, the, similitude, of, the, divine, rule, (4), as, for, fortune, and, advancement, the, beneficence, of, learning, is, not, so, confined, to, give, fortune, only, to, states, and, commonwealths, as, it, doth, not, likewise, give, fortune, to, particular, persons, for, it, was, well, noted, long, ago, that, homer, hath, given, more, men, their, livings, than, either, sylla, or, cæsar, or, augustus, ever, did, notwithstanding, their, great, largesses, and, donatives, and, distributions, of, lands, to, so, many, legions, and, no, doubt, it, is, hard, to, say, whether, arms, or, learning, have, advanced, greater, numbers, and, in, case, of, sovereignty, we, see, that, if, arms, or, descent, have, carried, away, the, kingdom, yet, learning, hath, carried, the, priesthood, which, ever, hath, been, in, some, competition, with, empire, (5), again, for, the, pleasure, and, delight, of, knowledge, and, learning, it, far, surpasseth, all, other, in, nature, for, shall, the, pleasures, of, the, affections, so, exceed, the, pleasure, of, the, sense, as, much, as, the, obtaining, of, desire, or, victory, exceedeth, a, song, or, a, dinner, and, must, not, of, consequence, the, pleasures, of, the, intellect, or, understanding, exceed, the, pleasures, of, the, affections, we, see, in, all, other, pleasures, there, is, satiety, and, after, they, be, used, their, verdure, departeth, which, showeth, well, they, be, but, deceits, of, pleasure, and, not, pleasures, and, that, it, was, the, novelty, which, pleased, and, not, the, quality, and, therefore, we, see, that, voluptuous, men, turn, friars, and, ambitions, princes, turn, melancholy, but, of, knowledge, there, is, no, satiety, but, satisfaction, and, appetite, are, perpetually, interchangeable, and, therefore, appeareth, to, be, good, in, itself, simply, without, fallacy, or, accident, neither, is, that, pleasure, of, small, efficacy, and, contentment, to, the, mind, of, man, which, the, poet, lucretius, describeth, elegantly, —, “suave, mari, magno, turbantibus, æquora, ventis, &c, ”, “it, is, a, view, of, delight, ”, saith, he, “to, stand, or, walk, upon, the, shore, side, and, to, see, a, ship, tossed, with, tempest, upon, the, sea, or, to, be, in, a, fortified, tower, and, to, see, two, battles, join, upon, a, plain, but, it, is, a, pleasure, incomparable, for, the, mind, of, man, to, be, settled, landed, and, fortified, in, the, certainty, of, truth, and, from, thence, to, descry, and, behold, the, errors, perturbations, labours, and, wanderings, up, and, down, of, other, men, ”, (6), lastly, leaving, the, vulgar, arguments, that, by, learning, man, excelleth, man, in, that, wherein, man, excelleth, beasts, that, by, learning, man, ascendeth, to, the, heavens, and, their, motions, where, in, body, he, cannot, come, and, the, like, let, us, conclude, with, the, dignity, and, excellency, of, knowledge, and, learning, in, that, whereunto, man’s, nature, doth, most, aspire, which, is, immortality, or, continuance, for, to, this, tendeth, generation, and, raising, of, houses, and, families, to, this, tend, buildings, foundations, and, monuments, to, this, tendeth, the, desire, of, memory, fame, and, celebration, and, in, effect, the, strength, of, all, other, human, desires, we, see, then, how, far, the, monuments, of, wit, and, learning, are, more, durable, than, the, monuments, of, power, or, of, the, hands, for, have, not, the, verses, of, homer, continued, twenty-five, hundred, years, or, more, without, the, loss, of, a, syllable, or, letter, during, which, the, infinite, palaces, temples, castles, cities, have, been, decayed, and, demolished, it, is, not, possible, to, have, the, true, pictures, or, statues, of, cyrus, alexander, cæsar, no, nor, of, the, kings, or, great, personages, of, much, later, years, for, the, originals, cannot, last, and, the, copies, cannot, but, leese, of, the, life, and, truth, but, the, images, of, men’s, wits, and, knowledges, remain, in, books, exempted, from, the, wrong, of, time, and, capable, of, perpetual, renovation, neither, are, they, fitly, to, be, called, images, because, they, generate, still, and, cast, their, seeds, in, the, minds, of, others, provoking, and, causing, infinite, actions, and, opinions, in, succeeding, ages, so, that, if, the, invention, of, the, ship, was, thought, so, noble, which, carrieth, riches, and, commodities, from, place, to, place, and, consociateth, the, most, remote, regions, in, participation, of, their, fruits, how, much, more, are, letters, to, be, magnified, which, as, ships, pass, through, the, vast, seas, of, time, and, make, ages, so, distant, to, participate, of, the, wisdom, illuminations, and, inventions, the, one, of, the, other, nay, further, we, see, some, of, the, philosophers, which, were, least, divine, and, most, immersed, in, the, senses, and, denied, generally, the, immortality, of, the, soul, yet, came, to, this, point, that, whatsoever, motions, the, spirit, of, man, could, act, and, perform, without, the, organs, of, the, body, they, thought, might, remain, after, death, which, were, only, those, of, the, understanding, and, not, of, the, affection, so, immortal, and, incorruptible, a, thing, did, knowledge, seem, unto, them, to, be, but, we, that, know, by, divine, revelation, that, not, only, the, understanding, but, the, affections, purified, not, only, the, spirit, but, the, body, changed, shall, be, advanced, to, immortality, do, disclaim, in, these, rudiments, of, the, senses, but, it, must, be, remembered, both, in, this, last, point, and, so, it, may, likewise, be, needful, in, other, places, that, in, probation, of, the, dignity, of, knowledge, or, learning, did, in, the, beginning, separate, divine, testimony, from, human, which, method, have, pursued, and, so, handled, them, both, apart, (7), nevertheless, do, not, pretend, and, know, it, will, be, impossible, for, me, by, any, pleading, of, mine, to, reverse, the, judgment, either, of, æsop’s, cock, that, preferred, the, barleycorn, before, the, gem, or, of, midas, that, being, chosen, judge, between, apollo, president, of, the, muses, and, pan, god, of, the, flocks, judged, for, plenty, or, of, paris, that, judged, for, beauty, and, love, against, wisdom, and, power, or, of, agrippina, _occidat, matrem_, _modo, imperet_, that, preferred, empire, with, any, condition, never, so, detestable, or, of, ulysses, _qui, vetulam, prætulit, immortalitati_, being, a, figure, of, those, which, prefer, custom, and, habit, before, all, excellency, or, of, a, number, of, the, like, popular, judgments, for, these, things, must, continue, as, they, have, been, but, so, will, that, also, continue, whereupon, learning, hath, ever, relied, and, which, faileth, not, _justificata, est, sapientia, a, filiis, suis_, _to, the, king_, might, seem, to, have, more, convenience, though, it, come, often, otherwise, to, pass, (excellent, king), that, those, which, are, fruitful, in, their, generations, and, have, in, themselves, the, foresight, of, immortality, in, their, descendants, should, likewise, be, more, careful, of, the, good, estate, of, future, times, unto, which, they, know, they, must, transmit, and, commend, over, their, dearest, pledges, queen, elizabeth, was, a, sojourner, in, the, world, in, respect, of, her, unmarried, life, and, was, a, blessing, to, her, own, times, and, yet, so, as, the, impression, of, her, good, government, besides, her, happy, memory, is, not, without, some, effect, which, doth, survive, her, but, to, your, majesty, whom, god, hath, already, blessed, with, so, much, royal, issue, worthy, to, continue, and, represent, you, for, ever, and, whose, youthful, and, fruitful, bed, doth, yet, promise, many, the, like, renovations, it, is, proper, and, agreeable, to, be, conversant, not, only, in, the, transitory, parts, of, good, government, but, in, those, acts, also, which, are, in, their, nature, permanent, and, perpetual, amongst, the, which, (if, affection, do, not, transport, me), there, is, not, any, more, worthy, than, the, further, endowment, of, the, world, with, sound, and, fruitful, knowledge, for, why, should, a, few, received, authors, stand, up, like, hercules’, columns, beyond, which, there, should, be, no, sailing, or, discovering, since, we, have, so, bright, and, benign, a, star, as, your, majesty, to, conduct, and, prosper, us, to, return, therefore, where, we, left, it, remaineth, to, consider, of, what, kind, those, acts, are, which, have, been, undertaken, and, performed, by, kings, and, others, for, the, increase, and, advancement, of, learning, wherein, purpose, to, speak, actively, without, digressing, or, dilating, let, this, ground, therefore, be, laid, that, all, works, are, over, common, by, amplitude, of, reward, by, soundness, of, direction, and, by, the, conjunction, of, labours, the, first, multiplieth, endeavour, the, second, preventeth, error, and, the, third, supplieth, the, frailty, of, man, but, the, principal, of, these, is, direction, for, _claudus, in, via, antevertit, cursorem, extra, viam_, and, solomon, excellently, setteth, it, down, “if, the, iron, be, not, sharp, it, requireth, more, strength, but, wisdom, is, that, which, prevaileth, ”, signifying, that, the, invention, or, election, of, the, mean, is, more, effectual, than, any, enforcement, or, accumulation, of, endeavours, this, am, induced, to, speak, for, that, (not, derogating, from, the, noble, intention, of, any, that, have, been, deservers, towards, the, state, of, learning), do, observe, nevertheless, that, their, works, and, acts, are, rather, matters, of, magnificence, and, memory, than, of, progression, and, proficience, and, tend, rather, to, augment, the, mass, of, learning, in, the, multitude, of, learned, men, than, to, rectify, or, raise, the, sciences, themselves, the, works, or, acts, of, merit, towards, learning, are, conversant, about, three, objects—the, places, of, learning, the, books, of, learning, and, the, persons, of, the, learned, for, as, water, whether, it, be, the, dew, of, heaven, or, the, springs, of, the, earth, doth, scatter, and, leese, itself, in, the, ground, except, it, be, collected, into, some, receptacle, where, it, may, by, union, comfort, and, sustain, itself, and, for, that, cause, the, industry, of, man, hath, made, and, framed, springheads, conduits, cisterns, and, pools, which, men, have, accustomed, likewise, to, beautify, and, adorn, with, accomplishments, of, magnificence, and, state, as, well, as, of, use, and, necessity, so, this, excellent, liquor, of, knowledge, whether, it, descend, from, divine, inspiration, or, spring, from, human, sense, would, soon, perish, and, vanish, to, oblivion, if, it, were, not, preserved, in, books, traditions, conferences, and, places, appointed, as, universities, colleges, and, schools, for, the, receipt, and, comforting, of, the, same, the, works, which, concern, the, seats, and, places, of, learning, are, four—foundations, and, buildings, endowments, with, revenues, endowments, with, franchises, and, privileges, institutions, and, ordinances, for, government—all, tending, to, quietness, and, privateness, of, life, and, discharge, of, cares, and, troubles, much, like, the, stations, which, virgil, prescribeth, for, the, hiving, of, bees, “principio, sedes, apibus, statioque, petenda, quo, neque, sit, ventis, aditus, &c, ”, the, works, touching, books, are, two—first, libraries, which, are, as, the, shrines, where, all, the, relics, of, the, ancient, saints, full, of, true, virtue, and, that, without, delusion, or, imposture, are, preserved, and, reposed, secondly, new, editions, of, authors, with, more, correct, impressions, more, faithful, translations, more, profitable, glosses, more, diligent, annotations, and, the, like, the, works, pertaining, to, the, persons, of, learned, men, (besides, the, advancement, and, countenancing, of, them, in, general), are, two—the, reward, and, designation, of, readers, in, sciences, already, extant, and, invented, and, the, reward, and, designation, of, writers, and, inquirers, concerning, any, parts, of, learning, not, sufficiently, laboured, and, prosecuted, these, are, summarily, the, works, and, acts, wherein, the, merits, of, many, excellent, princes, and, other, worthy, personages, have, been, conversant, as, for, any, particular, commemorations, call, to, mind, what, cicero, said, when, he, gave, general, thanks, _difficile, non, aliquem_, _ingratum, quenquam, præterire_, let, us, rather, according, to, the, scriptures, look, unto, that, part, of, the, race, which, is, before, us, than, look, back, to, that, which, is, already, attained, first, therefore, amongst, so, many, great, foundations, of, colleges, in, europe, find, strange, that, they, are, all, dedicated, to, professions, and, none, left, free, to, arts, and, sciences, at, large, for, if, men, judge, that, learning, should, be, referred, to, action, they, judge, well, but, in, this, they, fall, into, the, error, described, in, the, ancient, fable, in, which, the, other, parts, of, the, body, did, suppose, the, stomach, had, been, idle, because, it, neither, performed, the, office, of, motion, as, the, limbs, do, nor, of, sense, as, the, head, doth, but, yet, notwithstanding, it, is, the, stomach, that, digesteth, and, distributeth, to, all, the, rest, so, if, any, man, think, philosophy, and, universality, to, be, idle, studies, he, doth, not, consider, that, all, professions, are, from, thence, served, and, supplied, and, this, take, to, be, a, great, cause, that, hath, hindered, the, progression, of, learning, because, these, fundamental, knowledges, have, been, studied, but, in, passage, for, if, you, will, have, a, tree, bear, more, fruit, than, it, hath, used, to, do, it, is, not, anything, you, can, do, to, the, boughs, but, it, is, the, stirring, of, the, earth, and, putting, new, mould, about, thee, roots, that, must, work, it, neither, is, it, to, be, forgotten, that, this, dedicating, of, foundations, and, dotations, to, professory, learning, hath, not, only, had, a, malign, aspect, and, influence, upon, the, growth, of, sciences, but, hath, also, been, prejudicial, to, states, and, governments, for, hence, it, proceedeth, that, princes, find, a, solitude, in, regard, of, able, men, to, serve, them, in, causes, of, estate, because, there, is, no, education, collegiate, which, is, free, where, such, as, were, so, disposed, might, give, themselves, in, histories, modern, languages, books, of, policy, and, civil, discourse, and, other, the, like, enablements, unto, service, of, estate, and, because, founders, of, colleges, do, plant, and, founders, of, lectures, do, water, it, followeth, well, in, order, to, speak, of, the, defect, which, is, in, public, lectures, namely, in, the, smallness, and, meanness, of, the, salary, or, reward, which, in, most, places, is, assigned, unto, them, whether, they, be, lectures, of, arts, or, of, professions, for, it, is, necessary, to, the, progression, of, sciences, that, readers, be, of, the, most, able, and, sufficient, men, as, those, which, are, ordained, for, generating, and, propagating, of, sciences, and, not, for, transitory, use, this, cannot, be, except, their, condition, and, endowment, be, such, as, may, content, the, ablest, man, to, appropriate, his, whole, labour, and, continue, his, whole, age, in, that, function, and, attendance, and, therefore, must, have, a, proportion, answerable, to, that, mediocrity, or, competency, of, advancement, which, may, be, expected, from, a, profession, or, the, practice, of, a, profession, so, as, if, you, will, have, sciences, flourish, you, must, observe, david’s, military, law, which, was, “that, those, which, stayed, with, the, carriage, should, have, equal, part, with, those, which, were, in, the, action, ”, else, will, the, carriages, be, ill, attended, so, readers, in, sciences, are, indeed, the, guardians, of, the, stores, and, provisions, of, sciences, whence, men, in, active, courses, are, furnished, and, therefore, ought, to, have, equal, entertainment, with, them, otherwise, if, the, fathers, in, sciences, be, of, the, weakest, sort, or, be, ill, maintained, “et, patrum, invalidi, referent, jejunia, nati, ”, another, defect, note, wherein, shall, need, some, alchemist, to, help, me, who, call, upon, men, to, sell, their, books, and, to, build, furnaces, quitting, and, forsaking, minerva, and, the, muses, as, barren, virgins, and, relying, upon, vulcan, but, certain, it, is, that, unto, the, deep, fruitful, and, operative, study, of, many, sciences, specialty, natural, philosophy, and, physic, books, be, not, only, the, instrumentals, wherein, also, the, beneficence, of, men, hath, not, been, altogether, wanting, for, we, see, spheres, globes, astrolabes, maps, and, the, like, have, been, provided, as, appurtenances, to, astronomy, and, cosmography, as, well, as, books, we, see, likewise, that, some, places, instituted, for, physic, have, annexed, the, commodity, of, gardens, for, simples, of, all, sorts, and, do, likewise, command, the, use, of, dead, bodies, for, anatomies, but, these, do, respect, but, a, few, things, in, general, there, will, hardly, be, any, main, proficience, in, the, disclosing, of, nature, except, there, be, some, allowance, for, expenses, about, experiments, whether, they, be, experiments, appertaining, to, vulcanus, or, dædalus, furnace, or, engine, or, any, other, kind, and, therefore, as, secretaries, and, spials, of, princes, and, states, bring, in, bills, for, intelligence, so, you, must, allow, the, spials, and, intelligencers, of, nature, to, bring, in, their, bills, or, else, you, shall, be, ill, advertised, and, if, alexander, made, such, a, liberal, assignation, to, aristotle, of, treasure, for, the, allowance, of, hunters, fowlers, fishers, and, the, like, that, he, might, compile, a, history, of, nature, much, better, do, they, deserve, it, that, travail, in, arts, of, nature, another, defect, which, note, is, an, intermission, or, neglect, in, those, which, are, governors, in, universities, of, consultation, and, in, princes, or, superior, persons, of, visitation, to, enter, into, account, and, consideration, whether, the, readings, exercises, and, other, customs, appertaining, unto, learning, anciently, begun, and, since, continued, be, well, instituted, or, no, and, thereupon, to, ground, an, amendment, or, reformation, in, that, which, shall, be, found, inconvenient, for, it, is, one, of, your, majesty’s, own, most, wise, and, princely, maxims, “that, in, all, usages, and, precedents, the, times, be, considered, wherein, they, first, began, which, if, they, were, weak, or, ignorant, it, derogateth, from, the, authority, of, the, usage, and, leaveth, it, for, suspect, ”, and, therefore, inasmuch, as, most, of, the, usages, and, orders, of, the, universities, were, derived, from, more, obscure, times, it, is, the, more, requisite, they, be, re-examined, in, this, kind, will, give, an, instance, or, two, for, example, sake, of, things, that, are, the, most, obvious, and, familiar, the, one, is, a, matter, which, though, it, be, ancient, and, general, yet, hold, to, be, an, error, which, is, that, scholars, in, universities, come, too, soon, and, too, unripe, to, logic, and, rhetoric, arts, fitter, for, graduates, than, children, and, novices, for, these, two, rightly, taken, are, the, gravest, of, sciences, being, the, arts, of, arts, the, one, for, judgment, the, other, for, ornament, and, they, be, the, rules, and, directions, how, to, set, forth, and, dispose, matter, and, therefore, for, minds, empty, and, unfraught, with, matter, and, which, have, not, gathered, that, which, cicero, calleth, _sylva_, and, _supellex_, stuff, and, variety, to, begin, with, those, arts, (as, if, one, should, learn, to, weigh, or, to, measure, or, to, paint, the, wind), doth, work, but, this, effect, that, the, wisdom, of, those, arts, which, is, great, and, universal, is, almost, made, contemptible, and, is, degenerate, into, childish, sophistry, and, ridiculous, affectation, and, further, the, untimely, learning, of, them, hath, drawn, on, by, consequence, the, superficial, and, unprofitable, teaching, and, writing, of, them, as, fitteth, indeed, to, the, capacity, of, children, another, is, a, lack, find, in, the, exercises, used, in, the, universities, which, do, snake, too, great, a, divorce, between, invention, and, memory, for, their, speeches, are, either, premeditate, in, _verbis, conceptis_, where, nothing, is, left, to, invention, or, merely, extemporal, where, little, is, left, to, memory, whereas, in, life, and, action, there, is, least, use, of, either, of, these, but, rather, of, intermixtures, of, premeditation, and, invention, notes, and, memory, so, as, the, exercise, fitteth, not, the, practice, nor, the, image, the, life, and, it, is, ever, a, true, rule, in, exercises, that, they, be, framed, as, near, as, may, be, to, the, life, of, practice, for, otherwise, they, do, pervert, the, motions, and, faculties, of, the, mind, and, not, prepare, them, the, truth, whereof, is, not, obscure, when, scholars, come, to, the, practices, of, professions, or, other, actions, of, civil, life, which, when, they, set, into, this, want, is, soon, found, by, themselves, and, sooner, by, others, but, this, part, touching, the, amendment, of, the, institutions, and, orders, of, universities, will, conclude, with, the, clause, of, cæsar’s, letter, to, oppius, and, balbes, _hoc, quemadmodum, fieri, possit_, _nonnulla, mihi, in, mentem, veniunt_, _et, multa, reperiri, possunt_, _de, iis, rebus, rgo, vos, ut, cogitationem, suscipiatis_, another, defect, which, note, ascendeth, a, little, higher, than, the, precedent, for, as, the, proficience, of, learning, consisteth, much, in, the, orders, and, institutions, of, universities, in, the, same, states, and, kingdoms, so, it, would, be, yet, more, advanced, if, there, were, more, intelligence, mutual, between, the, universities, of, europe, than, now, there, is, we, see, there, be, many, orders, and, foundations, which, though, they, be, divided, under, several, sovereignties, and, territories, yet, they, take, themselves, to, have, a, kind, of, contract, fraternity, and, correspondence, one, with, the, other, insomuch, as, they, have, provincials, and, generals, and, surely, as, nature, createth, brotherhood, in, families, and, arts, mechanical, contract, brotherhoods, in, communalties, and, the, anointment, of, god, superinduceth, a, brotherhood, in, kings, and, bishops, so, in, like, manner, there, cannot, but, be, a, fraternity, in, learning, and, illumination, relating, to, that, paternity, which, is, attributed, to, god, who, is, called, the, father, of, illuminations, or, lights, the, last, defect, which, will, note, is, that, there, hath, not, been, or, very, rarely, been, any, public, designation, of, writers, or, inquirers, concerning, such, parts, of, knowledge, as, may, appear, not, to, have, been, already, sufficiently, laboured, or, undertaken, unto, which, point, it, is, an, inducement, to, enter, into, a, view, and, examination, what, parts, of, learning, have, been, prosecuted, and, what, omitted, for, the, opinion, of, plenty, is, amongst, the, causes, of, want, and, the, great, quantity, of, books, maketh, a, show, rather, of, superfluity, than, lack, which, surcharge, nevertheless, is, not, to, be, remedied, by, making, no, more, books, but, by, making, more, good, books, which, as, the, serpent, of, moses, might, devour, the, serpents, of, the, enchanters, the, removing, of, all, the, defects, formerly, enumerate, except, the, last, and, of, the, active, part, also, of, the, last, (which, is, the, designation, of, writers), are, _opera, basilica_, towards, which, the, endeavours, of, a, private, man, may, be, but, as, an, image, in, a, crossway, that, may, point, at, the, way, but, cannot, go, it, but, the, inducing, part, of, the, latter, (which, is, the, survey, of, learning), may, be, set, forward, by, private, travail, wherefore, will, now, attempt, to, make, a, general, and, faithful, perambulation, of, learning, with, an, inquiry, what, parts, thereof, lie, fresh, and, waste, and, not, improved, and, converted, by, the, industry, of, man, to, the, end, that, such, a, plot, made, and, recorded, to, memory, may, both, minister, light, to, any, public, designation, and, also, serve, to, excite, voluntary, endeavours, wherein, nevertheless, my, purpose, is, at, this, time, to, note, only, omissions, and, deficiences, and, not, to, make, any, redargution, of, errors, or, incomplete, prosecutions, for, it, is, one, thing, to, set, forth, what, ground, lieth, unmanured, and, another, thing, to, correct, ill, husbandry, in, that, which, is, manured, in, the, handling, and, undertaking, of, which, work, am, not, ignorant, what, it, is, that, do, now, move, and, attempt, nor, insensible, of, mine, own, weakness, to, sustain, my, purpose, but, my, hope, is, that, if, my, extreme, love, to, learning, carry, me, too, far, may, obtain, the, excuse, of, affection, for, that, “it, is, not, granted, to, man, to, love, and, to, be, wise, ”, but, know, well, can, use, no, other, liberty, of, judgment, than, must, leave, to, others, and, for, my, part, shall, be, indifferently, glad, either, to, perform, myself, or, accept, from, another, that, duty, of, humanity—_nam, qui, erranti, comiter, monstrat, viam_, &c, do, foresee, likewise, that, of, those, things, which, shall, enter, and, register, as, deficiences, and, omissions, many, will, conceive, and, censure, that, some, of, them, are, already, done, and, extant, others, to, be, but, curiosities, and, things, of, no, great, use, and, others, to, be, of, too, great, difficulty, and, almost, impossibility, to, be, compassed, and, effected, but, for, the, two, first, refer, myself, to, the, particulars, for, the, last, touching, impossibility, take, it, those, things, are, to, be, held, possible, which, may, be, done, by, some, person, though, not, by, every, one, and, which, may, be, done, by, many, though, not, by, any, one, and, which, may, be, done, in, the, succession, of, ages, though, not, within, the, hourglass, of, one, man’s, life, and, which, may, be, done, by, public, designation, though, not, by, private, endeavour, but, notwithstanding, if, any, man, will, take, to, himself, rather, that, of, solomon, “_dicit, piger_, _leo, est, in, via_, ”, than, that, of, virgil, “_possunt, quia, posse, videntur_, ”, shall, be, content, that, my, labours, be, esteemed, but, as, the, better, sort, of, wishes, for, as, it, asketh, some, knowledge, to, demand, a, question, not, impertinent, so, it, requireth, some, sense, to, make, a, wish, not, absurd, (1), the, parts, of, human, learning, have, reference, to, the, three, parts, of, man’s, understanding, which, is, the, seat, of, learning, history, to, his, memory, poesy, to, his, imagination, and, philosophy, to, his, reason, divine, learning, receiveth, the, same, distribution, for, the, spirit, of, man, is, the, same, though, the, revelation, of, oracle, and, sense, be, diverse, so, as, theology, consisteth, also, of, history, of, the, church, of, parables, which, is, divine, poesy, and, of, holy, doctrine, or, precept, for, as, for, that, part, which, seemeth, supernumerary, which, is, prophecy, it, is, but, divine, history, which, hath, that, prerogative, over, human, as, the, narration, may, be, before, the, fact, as, well, as, after, (2), history, is, natural, civil, ecclesiastical, and, literary, whereof, the, first, three, allow, as, extant, the, fourth, note, as, deficient, for, no, man, hath, propounded, to, himself, the, general, state, of, learning, to, be, described, and, represented, from, age, to, age, as, many, have, done, the, works, of, nature, and, the, state, civil, and, ecclesiastical, without, which, the, history, of, the, world, seemeth, to, me, to, be, as, the, statue, of, polyphemus, with, his, eye, out, that, part, being, wanting, which, doth, most, show, the, spirit, and, life, of, the, person, and, yet, am, not, ignorant, that, in, divers, particular, sciences, as, of, the, jurisconsults, the, mathematicians, the, rhetoricians, the, philosophers, there, are, set, down, some, small, memorials, of, the, schools, authors, and, books, and, so, likewise, some, barren, relations, touching, the, invention, of, arts, or, usages, but, a, just, story, of, learning, containing, the, antiquities, and, originals, of, knowledges, and, their, sects, their, inventions, their, traditions, their, diverse, administrations, and, managings, their, flourishings, their, oppositions, decays, depressions, oblivions, removes, with, the, causes, and, occasions, of, them, and, all, other, events, concerning, learning, throughout, the, ages, of, the, world, may, truly, affirm, to, be, wanting, the, use, and, end, of, which, work, do, not, so, much, design, for, curiosity, or, satisfaction, of, those, that, are, the, lovers, of, learning, but, chiefly, for, a, more, serious, and, grave, purpose, which, is, this, in, few, words, that, it, will, make, learned, men, wise, in, the, use, and, administration, of, learning, for, it, is, not, saint, augustine’s, nor, saint, ambrose’s, works, that, will, make, so, wise, a, divine, as, ecclesiastical, history, thoroughly, read, and, observed, and, the, same, reason, is, of, learning, (3), history, of, nature, is, of, three, sorts, of, nature, in, course, of, nature, erring, or, varying, and, of, nature, altered, or, wrought, that, is, history, of, creatures, history, of, marvels, and, history, of, arts, the, first, of, these, no, doubt, is, extant, and, that, in, good, perfection, the, two, latter, are, bandied, so, weakly, and, unprofitably, as, am, moved, to, note, them, as, deficient, for, find, no, sufficient, or, competent, collection, of, the, works, of, nature, which, have, a, digression, and, deflexion, from, the, ordinary, course, of, generations, productions, and, motions, whether, they, be, singularities, of, place, and, region, or, the, strange, events, of, time, and, chance, or, the, effects, of, yet, unknown, properties, or, the, instances, of, exception, to, general, kinds, it, is, true, find, a, number, of, books, of, fabulous, experiments, and, secrets, and, frivolous, impostures, for, pleasure, and, strangeness, but, a, substantial, and, severe, collection, of, the, heteroclites, or, irregulars, of, nature, well, examined, and, described, find, not, specially, not, with, due, rejection, of, fables, and, popular, errors, for, as, things, now, are, if, an, untruth, in, nature, be, once, on, foot, what, by, reason, of, the, neglect, of, examination, and, countenance, of, antiquity, and, what, by, reason, of, the, use, of, the, opinion, in, similitudes, and, ornaments, of, speech, it, is, never, called, down, (4), the, use, of, this, work, honoured, with, a, precedent, in, aristotle, is, nothing, less, than, to, give, contentment, to, the, appetite, of, curious, and, vain, wits, as, the, manner, of, mirabilaries, is, to, do, but, for, two, reasons, both, of, great, weight, the, one, to, correct, the, partiality, of, axioms, and, opinions, which, are, commonly, framed, only, upon, common, and, familiar, examples, the, other, because, from, the, wonders, of, nature, is, the, nearest, intelligence, and, passage, towards, the, wonders, of, art, for, it, is, no, more, but, by, following, and, as, it, were, hounding, nature, in, her, wanderings, to, be, able, to, lead, her, afterwards, to, the, same, place, again, neither, am, of, opinion, in, this, history, of, marvels, that, superstitious, narrations, of, sorceries, witchcrafts, dreams, divinations, and, the, like, where, there, is, an, assurance, and, clear, evidence, of, the, fact, be, altogether, excluded, for, it, is, not, yet, known, in, what, cases, and, how, far, effects, attributed, to, superstition, do, participate, of, natural, causes, and, therefore, howsoever, the, practice, of, such, things, is, to, be, condemned, yet, from, the, speculation, and, consideration, of, them, light, may, be, taken, not, only, for, the, discerning, of, the, offences, but, for, the, further, disclosing, of, nature, neither, ought, a, man, to, make, scruple, of, entering, into, these, things, for, inquisition, of, truth, as, your, majesty, hath, showed, in, your, own, example, who, with, the, two, clear, eyes, of, religion, and, natural, philosophy, have, looked, deeply, and, wisely, into, these, shadows, and, yet, proved, yourself, to, be, of, the, nature, of, the, sun, which, passeth, through, pollutions, and, itself, remains, as, pure, as, before, but, this, hold, fit, that, these, narrations, which, have, mixture, with, superstition, be, sorted, by, themselves, and, not, to, be, mingled, with, the, narrations, which, are, merely, and, sincerely, natural, but, as, for, the, narrations, touching, the, prodigies, and, miracles, of, religions, they, are, either, not, true, or, not, natural, and, therefore, impertinent, for, the, story, of, nature, (5), for, history, of, nature, wrought, or, mechanical, find, some, collections, made, of, agriculture, and, likewise, of, manual, arts, but, commonly, with, a, rejection, of, experiments, familiar, and, vulgar, for, it, is, esteemed, a, kind, of, dishonour, unto, learning, to, descend, to, inquiry, or, meditation, upon, matters, mechanical, except, they, be, such, as, may, be, thought, secrets, rarities, and, special, subtleties, which, humour, of, vain, and, supercilious, arrogancy, is, justly, derided, in, plato, where, he, brings, in, hippias, a, vaunting, sophist, disputing, with, socrates, a, true, and, unfeigned, inquisitor, of, truth, where, the, subject, being, touching, beauty, socrates, after, his, wandering, manner, of, inductions, put, first, an, example, of, a, fair, virgin, and, then, of, a, fair, horse, and, then, of, a, fair, pot, well, glazed, whereat, hippias, was, offended, and, said, “more, than, for, courtesy’s, sake, he, did, think, much, to, dispute, with, any, that, did, allege, such, base, and, sordid, instances, ”, whereunto, socrates, answereth, “you, have, reason, and, it, becomes, you, well, being, a, man, so, trim, in, your, vestments, ”, &c, and, so, goeth, on, in, an, irony, but, the, truth, is, they, be, not, the, highest, instances, that, give, the, securest, information, as, may, be, well, expressed, in, the, tale, so, common, of, the, philosopher, that, while, he, gazed, upwards, to, the, stars, fell, into, the, water, for, if, he, had, looked, down, he, might, have, seen, the, stars, in, the, water, but, looking, aloft, he, could, not, see, the, water, in, the, stars, so, it, cometh, often, to, pass, that, mean, and, small, things, discover, great, better, than, great, can, discover, the, small, and, therefore, aristotle, noteth, well, “that, the, nature, of, everything, is, best, seen, in, his, smallest, portions, ”, and, for, that, cause, he, inquireth, the, nature, of, a, commonwealth, first, in, a, family, and, the, simple, conjugations, of, man, and, wife, parent, and, child, master, and, servant, which, are, in, every, cottage, even, so, likewise, the, nature, of, this, great, city, of, the, world, and, the, policy, thereof, must, be, first, sought, in, mean, concordances, and, small, portions, so, we, see, how, that, secret, of, nature, of, the, turning, of, iron, touched, with, the, loadstone, towards, the, north, was, found, out, in, needles, of, iron, not, in, bars, of, iron, (6), but, if, my, judgment, be, of, any, weight, the, use, of, history, mechanical, is, of, all, others, the, most, radical, and, fundamental, towards, natural, philosophy, such, natural, philosophy, as, shall, not, vanish, in, the, fume, of, subtle, sublime, or, delectable, speculation, but, such, as, shall, be, operative, to, the, endowment, and, benefit, of, man’s, life, for, it, will, not, only, minister, and, suggest, for, the, present, many, ingenious, practices, in, all, trades, by, a, connection, and, transferring, of, the, observations, of, one, art, to, the, use, of, another, when, the, experiences, of, several, mysteries, shall, fall, under, the, consideration, of, one, man’s, mind, but, further, it, will, give, a, more, true, and, real, illumination, concerning, causes, and, axioms, than, is, hitherto, attained, for, like, as, a, man’s, disposition, is, never, well, known, till, he, be, crossed, nor, proteus, ever, changed, shapes, till, he, was, straitened, and, held, fast, so, the, passages, and, variations, of, nature, cannot, appear, so, fully, in, the, liberty, of, nature, as, in, the, trials, and, vexations, of, art, (1), for, civil, history, it, is, of, three, kinds, not, unfitly, to, be, compared, with, the, three, kinds, of, pictures, or, images, for, of, pictures, or, images, we, see, some, are, unfinished, some, are, perfect, and, some, are, defaced, so, of, histories, we, may, find, three, kinds, memorials, perfect, histories, and, antiquities, for, memorials, are, history, unfinished, or, the, first, or, rough, drafts, of, history, and, antiquities, are, history, defaced, or, some, remnants, of, history, which, have, casually, escaped, the, shipwreck, of, time, (2), memorials, or, preparatory, history, are, of, two, sorts, whereof, the, one, may, be, termed, commentaries, and, the, other, registers, commentaries, are, they, which, set, down, a, continuance, of, the, naked, events, and, actions, without, the, motives, or, designs, the, counsels, the, speeches, the, pretexts, the, occasions, and, other, passages, of, action, for, this, is, the, true, nature, of, a, commentary, (though, cæsar, in, modesty, mixed, with, greatness, did, for, his, pleasure, apply, the, name, of, a, commentary, to, the, best, history, of, the, world), registers, are, collections, of, public, acts, as, decrees, of, council, judicial, proceedings, declarations, and, letters, of, estate, orations, and, the, like, without, a, perfect, continuance, or, contexture, of, the, thread, of, the, narration, (3), antiquities, or, remnants, of, history, are, as, was, said, _tanquam, tabula, naufragii_, when, industrious, persons, by, an, exact, and, scrupulous, diligence, and, observation, out, of, monuments, names, words, proverbs, traditions, private, records, and, evidences, fragments, of, stories, passages, of, books, that, concern, not, story, and, the, like, do, save, and, recover, somewhat, from, the, deluge, of, time, (4), in, these, kinds, of, unperfect, histories, do, assign, no, deficience, for, they, are, _tanquam, imperfecte, mista_, and, therefore, any, deficience, in, them, is, but, their, nature, as, for, the, corruptions, and, moths, of, history, which, are, epitomes, the, use, of, them, deserveth, to, be, banished, as, all, men, of, sound, judgment, have, confessed, as, those, that, have, fretted, and, corroded, the, sound, bodies, of, many, excellent, histories, and, wrought, them, into, base, and, unprofitable, dregs, (5), history, which, may, be, called, just, and, perfect, history, is, of, three, kinds, according, to, the, object, which, it, propoundeth, or, pretendeth, to, represent, for, it, either, representeth, a, time, or, a, person, or, an, action, the, first, we, call, chronicles, the, second, lives, and, the, third, narrations, or, relations, of, these, although, the, first, be, the, most, complete, and, absolute, kind, of, history, and, hath, most, estimation, and, glory, yet, the, second, excelleth, it, in, profit, and, use, and, the, third, in, verity, and, sincerity, for, history, of, times, representeth, the, magnitude, of, actions, and, the, public, faces, and, deportments, of, persons, and, passeth, over, in, silence, the, smaller, passages, and, motions, of, men, and, matters, but, such, being, the, workmanship, of, god, as, he, doth, hang, the, greatest, weight, upon, the, smallest, wires, _maxima, è, minimis_, _suspendens_, it, comes, therefore, to, pass, that, such, histories, do, rather, set, forth, the, pomp, of, business, than, the, true, and, inward, resorts, thereof, but, lives, if, they, be, well, written, propounding, to, themselves, a, person, to, represent, in, whom, actions, both, greater, and, smaller, public, and, private, have, a, commixture, must, of, necessity, contain, a, more, true, native, and, lively, representation, so, again, narrations, and, relations, of, actions, as, the, war, of, peloponnesus, the, expedition, of, cyrus, minor, the, conspiracy, of, catiline, cannot, but, be, more, purely, and, exactly, true, than, histories, of, times, because, they, may, choose, an, argument, comprehensible, within, the, notice, and, instructions, of, the, writer, whereas, he, that, undertaketh, the, story, of, a, time, specially, of, any, length, cannot, but, meet, with, many, blanks, and, spaces, which, he, must, be, forced, to, fill, up, out, of, his, own, wit, and, conjecture, (6), for, the, history, of, times, mean, of, civil, history, the, providence, of, god, hath, made, the, distribution, for, it, hath, pleased, god, to, ordain, and, illustrate, two, exemplar, states, of, the, world, for, arms, learning, moral, virtue, policy, and, laws, the, state, of, græcia, and, the, state, of, rome, the, histories, whereof, occupying, the, middle, part, of, time, have, more, ancient, to, them, histories, which, may, by, one, common, name, be, termed, the, antiquities, of, the, world, and, after, them, histories, which, may, be, likewise, called, by, the, name, of, modern, history, (7), now, to, speak, of, the, deficiences, as, to, the, heathen, antiquities, of, the, world, it, is, in, vain, to, note, them, for, deficient, deficient, they, are, no, doubt, consisting, most, of, fables, and, fragments, but, the, deficience, cannot, be, holpen, for, antiquity, is, like, fame, _caput, inter, nubila, condit_, her, head, is, muffled, from, our, sight, for, the, history, of, the, exemplar, states, it, is, extant, in, good, perfection, not, but, could, wish, there, were, a, perfect, course, of, history, for, græcia, from, theseus, to, philopœmen, (what, time, the, affairs, of, græcia, drowned, and, extinguished, in, the, affairs, of, rome), and, for, rome, from, romulus, to, justinianus, who, may, be, truly, said, to, be, _ultimus, romanorum_, in, which, sequences, of, story, the, text, of, thucydides, and, xenophon, in, the, one, and, the, texts, of, livius, polybius, sallustius, cæsar, appianus, tacitus, herodianus, in, the, other, to, be, kept, entire, without, any, diminution, at, all, and, only, to, be, supplied, and, continued, but, this, is, a, matter, of, magnificence, rather, to, be, commended, than, required, and, we, speak, now, of, parts, of, learning, supplemental, and, not, of, supererogation, (8), but, for, modern, histories, whereof, there, are, some, few, very, worthy, but, the, greater, part, beneath, mediocrity, leaving, the, care, of, foreign, stories, to, foreign, states, because, will, not, be, _curiosus, in, aliena, republica_, cannot, fail, to, represent, to, your, majesty, the, unworthiness, of, the, history, of, england, in, the, main, continuance, thereof, and, the, partiality, and, obliquity, of, that, of, scotland, in, the, latest, and, largest, author, that, have, seen, supposing, that, it, would, be, honour, for, your, majesty, and, a, work, very, memorable, if, this, island, of, great, britain, as, it, is, now, joined, in, monarchy, for, the, ages, to, come, so, were, joined, in, one, history, for, the, times, passed, after, the, manner, of, the, sacred, history, which, draweth, down, the, story, of, the, ten, tribes, and, of, the, two, tribes, as, twins, together, and, if, it, shall, seem, that, the, greatness, of, this, work, may, make, it, less, exactly, performed, there, is, an, excellent, period, of, a, much, smaller, compass, of, time, as, to, the, story, of, england, that, is, to, say, from, the, uniting, of, the, roses, to, the, uniting, of, the, kingdoms, a, portion, of, time, wherein, to, my, understanding, there, hath, been, the, rarest, varieties, that, in, like, number, of, successions, of, any, hereditary, monarchy, hath, been, known, for, it, beginneth, with, the, mixed, adoption, of, a, crown, by, arms, and, title, an, entry, by, battle, an, establishment, by, marriage, and, therefore, times, answerable, like, waters, after, a, tempest, full, of, working, and, swelling, though, without, extremity, of, storm, but, well, passed, through, by, the, wisdom, of, the, pilot, being, one, of, the, most, sufficient, kings, of, all, the, number, then, followeth, the, reign, of, a, king, whose, actions, howsoever, conducted, had, much, intermixture, with, the, affairs, of, europe, balancing, and, inclining, them, variably, in, whose, time, also, began, that, great, alteration, in, the, state, ecclesiastical, an, action, which, seldom, cometh, upon, the, stage, then, the, reign, of, a, minor, then, an, offer, of, a, usurpation, (though, it, was, but, as, _febris, ephemera_), then, the, reign, of, a, queen, matched, with, a, foreigner, then, of, a, queen, that, lived, solitary, and, unmarried, and, yet, her, government, so, masculine, as, it, had, greater, impression, and, operation, upon, the, states, abroad, than, it, any, ways, received, from, thence, and, now, last, this, most, happy, and, glorious, event, that, this, island, of, britain, divided, from, all, the, world, should, be, united, in, itself, and, that, oracle, of, rest, given, to, æneas, _antiquam, exquirite, matrem_, should, now, be, performed, and, fulfilled, upon, the, nations, of, england, and, scotland, being, now, reunited, in, the, ancient, mother, name, of, britain, as, a, full, period, of, all, instability, and, peregrinations, so, that, as, it, cometh, to, pass, in, massive, bodies, that, they, have, certain, trepidations, and, waverings, before, they, fix, and, settle, so, it, seemeth, that, by, the, providence, of, god, this, monarchy, before, it, was, to, settle, in, your, majesty, and, your, generations, (in, which, hope, it, is, now, established, for, ever), it, had, these, prelusive, changes, and, varieties, (9), for, lives, do, find, strange, that, these, times, have, so, little, esteemed, the, virtues, of, the, times, as, that, the, writings, of, lives, should, be, no, more, frequent, for, although, there, be, not, many, sovereign, princes, or, absolute, commanders, and, that, states, are, most, collected, into, monarchies, yet, are, there, many, worthy, personages, that, deserve, better, than, dispersed, report, or, barren, eulogies, for, herein, the, invention, of, one, of, the, late, poets, is, proper, and, doth, well, enrich, the, ancient, fiction, for, he, feigneth, that, at, the, end, of, the, thread, or, web, of, every, man’s, life, there, was, a, little, medal, containing, the, person’s, name, and, that, time, waited, upon, the, shears, and, as, soon, as, the, thread, was, cut, caught, the, medals, and, carried, them, to, the, river, of, lathe, and, about, the, bank, there, were, many, birds, flying, up, and, down, that, would, get, the, medals, and, carry, them, in, their, beak, a, little, while, and, then, let, them, fall, into, the, river, only, there, were, a, few, swans, which, if, they, got, a, name, would, carry, it, to, a, temple, where, it, was, consecrate, and, although, many, men, more, mortal, in, their, affections, than, in, their, bodies, do, esteem, desire, of, name, and, memory, but, as, a, vanity, and, ventosity, “animi, nil, magnæ, laudis, egentes, ”, which, opinion, cometh, from, that, root, _non, prius, laudes, contempsimus_, _quam, laudanda, facere, desivimus_, yet, that, will, not, alter, solomon’s, judgment, _memoria, justi, cum, laudibus_, _at, impiorum, nomen, putrescet_, the, one, flourisheth, the, other, either, consumeth, to, present, oblivion, or, turneth, to, an, ill, odour, and, therefore, in, that, style, or, addition, which, is, and, hath, been, long, well, received, and, brought, in, use, _felicis, memoriæ_, _piæ, memoriæ_, _bonæ, memoriæ_, we, do, acknowledge, that, which, cicero, saith, borrowing, it, from, demosthenes, that, _bona, fama, propria, possessio, defunctorum_, which, possession, cannot, but, note, that, in, our, times, it, lieth, much, waste, and, that, therein, there, is, a, deficience, (10), for, narrations, and, relations, of, particular, actions, there, were, also, to, be, wished, a, greater, diligence, therein, for, there, is, no, great, action, but, hath, some, good, pen, which, attends, it, and, because, it, is, an, ability, not, common, to, write, a, good, history, as, may, well, appear, by, the, small, number, of, them, yet, if, particularity, of, actions, memorable, were, but, tolerably, reported, as, they, pass, the, compiling, of, a, complete, history, of, times, might, be, the, better, expected, when, a, writer, should, arise, that, were, fit, for, it, for, the, collection, of, such, relations, might, be, as, a, nursery, garden, whereby, to, plant, a, fair, and, stately, garden, when, time, should, serve, (11), there, is, yet, another, partition, of, history, which, cornelius, tacitus, maketh, which, is, not, to, be, forgotten, specially, with, that, application, which, he, accoupleth, it, withal, annals, and, journals, appropriating, to, the, former, matters, of, estate, and, to, the, latter, acts, and, accidents, of, a, meaner, nature, for, giving, but, a, touch, of, certain, magnificent, buildings, he, addeth, _cum, ex, dignitate, populi, romani, repertum, sit_, _res, illustres, annalibus_, _talia, diurnis, urbis, actis, mandare_, so, as, there, is, a, kind, of, contemplative, heraldry, as, well, as, civil, and, as, nothing, doth, derogate, from, the, dignity, of, a, state, more, than, confusion, of, degrees, so, it, doth, not, a, little, imbase, the, authority, of, a, history, to, intermingle, matters, of, triumph, or, matters, of, ceremony, or, matters, of, novelty, with, matters, of, state, but, the, use, of, a, journal, hath, not, only, been, in, the, history, of, time, but, likewise, in, the, history, of, persons, and, chiefly, of, actions, for, princes, in, ancient, time, had, upon, point, of, honour, and, policy, both, journals, kept, what, passed, day, by, day, for, we, see, the, chronicle, which, was, read, before, ahasuerus, when, he, could, not, take, rest, contained, matter, of, affairs, indeed, but, such, as, had, passed, in, his, own, time, and, very, lately, before, but, the, journal, of, alexander’s, house, expressed, every, small, particularity, even, concerning, his, person, and, court, and, it, is, yet, a, use, well, received, in, enterprises, memorable, as, expeditions, of, war, navigations, and, the, like, to, keep, diaries, of, that, which, passeth, continually, (12), cannot, likewise, be, ignorant, of, a, form, of, writing, which, some, grave, and, wise, men, have, used, containing, a, scattered, history, of, those, actions, which, they, have, thought, worthy, of, memory, with, politic, discourse, and, observation, thereupon, not, incorporate, into, the, history, but, separately, and, as, the, more, principal, in, their, intention, which, kind, of, ruminated, history, think, more, fit, to, place, amongst, books, of, policy, whereof, we, shall, hereafter, speak, than, amongst, books, of, history, for, it, is, the, true, office, of, history, to, represent, the, events, themselves, together, with, the, counsels, and, to, leave, the, observations, and, conclusions, thereupon, to, the, liberty, and, faculty, of, every, man’s, judgment, but, mixtures, are, things, irregular, whereof, no, man, can, define, (13), so, also, is, there, another, kind, of, history, manifoldly, mixed, and, that, is, history, of, cosmography, being, compounded, of, natural, history, in, respect, of, the, regions, themselves, of, history, civil, in, respect, of, the, habitations, regiments, and, manners, of, the, people, and, the, mathematics, in, respect, of, the, climates, and, configurations, towards, the, heavens, which, part, of, learning, of, all, others, in, this, latter, time, hath, obtained, most, proficience, for, it, may, be, truly, affirmed, to, the, honour, of, these, times, and, in, a, virtuous, emulation, with, antiquity, that, this, great, building, of, the, world, had, never, through-lights, made, in, it, till, the, age, of, us, and, our, fathers, for, although, they, had, knowledge, of, the, antipodes, “nosque, ubi, primus, equis, oriens, afflavit, anhelis, illic, sera, rubens, accendit, lumina, vesper, ”, yet, that, might, be, by, demonstration, and, not, in, fact, and, if, by, travel, it, requireth, the, voyage, but, of, half, the, globe, but, to, circle, the, earth, as, the, heavenly, bodies, do, was, not, done, nor, enterprised, till, these, later, times, and, therefore, these, times, may, justly, bear, in, their, word, not, only, _plus, ultra_, in, precedence, of, the, ancient, _non, ultra_, and, _imitabile, fulmen_, in, precedence, of, the, ancient, _non, imitabile, fulmen_, “demens, qui, nimbos, et, non, imitabile, fulmen, ”, &c, but, likewise, _imitabile, cælum_, in, respect, of, the, many, memorable, voyages, after, the, manner, of, heaven, about, the, globe, of, the, earth, (14), and, this, proficience, in, navigation, and, discoveries, may, plant, also, an, expectation, of, the, further, proficience, and, augmentation, of, all, sciences, because, it, may, seem, they, are, ordained, by, god, to, be, coevals, that, is, to, meet, in, one, age, for, so, the, prophet, daniel, speaking, of, the, latter, times, foretelleth, _plurimi, pertransibunt_, _et, multiplex, erit, scientia_, as, if, the, openness, and, through-passage, of, the, world, and, the, increase, of, knowledge, were, appointed, to, be, in, the, same, ages, as, we, see, it, is, already, performed, in, great, part, the, learning, of, these, later, times, not, much, giving, place, to, the, former, two, periods, or, returns, of, learning, the, one, of, the, grecians, the, other, of, the, romans, (1), history, ecclesiastical, receiveth, the, same, divisions, with, history, civil, but, further, in, the, propriety, thereof, may, be, divided, into, the, history, of, the, church, by, a, general, name, history, of, prophecy, and, history, of, providence, the, first, describeth, the, times, of, the, militant, church, whether, it, be, fluctuant, as, the, ark, of, noah, or, movable, as, the, ark, in, the, wilderness, or, at, rest, as, the, ark, in, the, temple, that, is, the, state, of, the, church, in, persecution, in, remove, and, in, peace, this, part, ought, in, no, sort, to, note, as, deficient, only, would, that, the, virtue, and, sincerity, of, it, were, according, to, the, mass, and, quantity, but, am, not, now, in, hand, with, censures, but, with, omissions, (2), the, second, which, is, history, of, prophecy, consisteth, of, two, relatives—the, prophecy, and, the, accomplishment, and, therefore, the, nature, of, such, a, work, ought, to, be, that, every, prophecy, of, the, scripture, be, sorted, with, the, event, fulfilling, the, same, throughout, the, ages, of, the, world, both, for, the, better, confirmation, of, faith, and, for, the, better, illumination, of, the, church, touching, those, parts, of, prophecies, which, are, yet, unfulfilled, allowing, nevertheless, that, latitude, which, is, agreeable, and, familiar, unto, divine, prophecies, being, of, the, nature, of, their, author, with, whom, a, thousand, years, are, but, as, one, day, and, therefore, are, not, fulfilled, punctually, at, once, but, have, springing, and, germinant, accomplishment, throughout, many, ages, though, the, height, or, fulness, of, them, may, refer, to, some, one, age, this, is, a, work, which, find, deficient, but, is, to, be, done, with, wisdom, sobriety, and, reverence, or, not, at, all, (3), the, third, which, is, history, of, providence, containeth, that, excellent, correspondence, which, is, between, god’s, revealed, will, and, his, secret, will, which, though, it, be, so, obscure, as, for, the, most, part, it, is, not, legible, to, the, natural, man—no, nor, many, times, to, those, that, behold, it, from, the, tabernacle—yet, at, some, times, it, pleaseth, god, for, our, better, establishment, and, the, confuting, of, those, which, are, as, without, god, in, the, world, to, write, it, in, such, text, and, capital, letters, that, as, the, prophet, saith, “he, that, runneth, by, may, read, it”—that, is, mere, sensual, persons, which, hasten, by, god’s, judgments, and, never, bend, or, fix, their, cogitations, upon, them, are, nevertheless, in, their, passage, and, race, urged, to, discern, it, such, are, the, notable, events, and, examples, of, god’s, judgments, chastisements, deliverances, and, blessings, and, this, is, a, work, which, has, passed, through, the, labour, of, many, and, therefore, cannot, present, as, omitted, (4), there, are, also, other, parts, of, learning, which, are, appendices, to, history, for, all, the, exterior, proceedings, of, man, consist, of, words, and, deeds, whereof, history, doth, properly, receive, and, retain, in, memory, the, deeds, and, if, words, yet, but, as, inducements, and, passages, to, deeds, so, are, there, other, books, and, writings, which, are, appropriate, to, the, custody, and, receipt, of, words, only, which, likewise, are, of, three, sorts—orations, letters, and, brief, speeches, or, sayings, orations, are, pleadings, speeches, of, counsel, laudatives, invectives, apologies, reprehensions, orations, of, formality, or, ceremony, and, the, like, letters, are, according, to, all, the, variety, of, occasions, advertisements, advises, directions, propositions, petitions, commendatory, expostulatory, satisfactory, of, compliment, of, pleasure, of, discourse, and, all, other, passages, of, action, and, such, as, are, written, from, wise, men, are, of, all, the, words, of, man, in, my, judgment, the, best, for, they, are, more, natural, than, orations, and, public, speeches, and, more, advised, than, conferences, or, present, speeches, so, again, letters, of, affairs, from, such, as, manage, them, or, are, privy, to, them, are, of, all, others, the, best, instructions, for, history, and, to, a, diligent, reader, the, best, histories, in, themselves, for, apophthegms, it, is, a, great, loss, of, that, book, of, cæsar’s, for, as, his, history, and, those, few, letters, of, his, which, we, have, and, those, apophthegms, which, were, of, his, own, excel, all, men’s, else, so, suppose, would, his, collection, of, apophthegms, have, done, for, as, for, those, which, are, collected, by, others, either, have, no, taste, in, such, matters, or, else, their, choice, hath, not, been, happy, but, upon, these, three, kinds, of, writings, do, not, insist, because, have, no, deficiences, to, propound, concerning, them, (5), thus, much, therefore, concerning, history, which, is, that, part, of, learning, which, answereth, to, one, of, the, cells, domiciles, or, offices, of, the, mind, of, man, which, is, that, of, the, memory, (1), poesy, is, a, part, of, learning, in, measure, of, words, for, the, most, part, restrained, but, in, all, other, points, extremely, licensed, and, doth, truly, refer, to, the, imagination, which, being, not, tied, to, the, laws, of, matter, may, at, pleasure, join, that, which, nature, hath, severed, and, sever, that, which, nature, hath, joined, and, so, make, unlawful, matches, and, divorces, of, things—_pictoribus, atque, poetis_, &c, it, is, taken, in, two, senses, in, respect, of, words, or, matter, in, the, first, sense, it, is, but, a, character, of, style, and, belongeth, to, arts, of, speech, and, is, not, pertinent, for, the, present, in, the, latter, it, is—as, hath, been, said—one, of, the, principal, portions, of, learning, and, is, nothing, else, but, feigned, history, which, may, be, styled, as, well, in, prose, as, in, verse, (2), the, use, of, this, feigned, history, hath, been, to, give, some, shadow, of, satisfaction, to, the, mind, of, man, in, those, points, wherein, the, nature, of, things, doth, deny, it, the, world, being, in, proportion, inferior, to, the, soul, by, reason, whereof, there, is, agreeable, to, the, spirit, of, man, a, more, ample, greatness, a, more, exact, goodness, and, a, more, absolute, variety, than, can, be, found, in, the, nature, of, things, therefore, because, the, acts, or, events, of, true, history, have, not, that, magnitude, which, satisfieth, the, mind, of, man, poesy, feigneth, acts, and, events, greater, and, more, heroical, because, true, history, propoundeth, the, successes, and, issues, of, actions, not, so, agreeable, to, the, merits, of, virtue, and, vice, therefore, poesy, feigns, them, more, just, in, retribution, and, more, according, to, revealed, providence, because, true, history, representeth, actions, and, events, more, ordinary, and, less, interchanged, therefore, poesy, endueth, them, with, more, rareness, and, more, unexpected, and, alternative, variations, so, as, it, appeareth, that, poesy, serveth, and, conferreth, to, magnanimity, morality, and, to, delectation, and, therefore, it, was, ever, thought, to, have, some, participation, of, divineness, because, it, doth, raise, and, erect, the, mind, by, submitting, the, shows, of, things, to, the, desires, of, the, mind, whereas, reason, doth, buckle, and, bow, the, mind, unto, the, nature, of, things, and, we, see, that, by, these, insinuations, and, congruities, with, man’s, nature, and, pleasure, joined, also, with, the, agreement, and, consort, it, hath, with, music, it, hath, had, access, and, estimation, in, rude, times, and, barbarous, regions, where, other, learning, stood, excluded, (3), the, division, of, poesy, which, is, aptest, in, the, propriety, thereof, (besides, those, divisions, which, are, common, unto, it, with, history, as, feigned, chronicles, feigned, lives, and, the, appendices, of, history, as, feigned, epistles, feigned, orations, and, the, rest), is, into, poesy, narrative, representative, and, allusive, the, narrative, is, a, mere, imitation, of, history, with, the, excesses, before, remembered, choosing, for, subjects, commonly, wars, and, love, rarely, state, and, sometimes, pleasure, or, mirth, representative, is, as, a, visible, history, and, is, an, image, of, actions, as, if, they, were, present, as, history, is, of, actions, in, nature, as, they, are, (that, is), past, allusive, or, parabolical, is, a, narration, applied, only, to, express, some, special, purpose, or, conceit, which, latter, kind, of, parabolical, wisdom, was, much, more, in, use, in, the, ancient, times, as, by, the, fables, of, æsop, and, the, brief, sentences, of, the, seven, and, the, use, of, hieroglyphics, may, appear, and, the, cause, was, (for, that, it, was, then, of, necessity, to, express, any, point, of, reason, which, was, more, sharp, or, subtle, than, the, vulgar, in, that, manner), because, men, in, those, times, wanted, both, variety, of, examples, and, subtlety, of, conceit, and, as, hieroglyphics, were, before, letters, so, parables, were, before, arguments, and, nevertheless, now, and, at, all, times, they, do, retain, much, life, and, rigour, because, reason, cannot, be, so, sensible, nor, examples, so, fit, (4), but, there, remaineth, yet, another, use, of, poesy, parabolical, opposite, to, that, which, we, last, mentioned, for, that, tendeth, to, demonstrate, and, illustrate, that, which, is, taught, or, delivered, and, this, other, to, retire, and, obscure, it—that, is, when, the, secrets, and, mysteries, of, religion, policy, or, philosophy, are, involved, in, fables, or, parables, of, this, in, divine, poesy, we, see, the, use, is, authorised, in, heathen, poesy, we, see, the, exposition, of, fables, doth, fall, out, sometimes, with, great, felicity, as, in, the, fable, that, the, giants, being, overthrown, in, their, war, against, the, gods, the, earth, their, mother, in, revenge, thereof, brought, forth, fame, “illam, terra, parens, ira, irritat, deorum, extremam, ut, perhibent, cœo, enceladoque, soroem, progenuit, ”, expounded, that, when, princes, and, monarchs, have, suppressed, actual, and, open, rebels, then, the, malignity, of, people, (which, is, the, mother, of, rebellion), doth, bring, forth, libels, and, slanders, and, taxations, of, the, states, which, is, of, the, same, kind, with, rebellion, but, more, feminine, so, in, the, fable, that, the, rest, of, the, gods, having, conspired, to, bind, jupiter, pallas, called, briareus, with, his, hundred, hands, to, his, aid, expounded, that, monarchies, need, not, fear, any, curbing, of, their, absoluteness, by, mighty, subjects, as, long, as, by, wisdom, they, keep, the, hearts, of, the, people, who, will, be, sure, to, come, in, on, their, side, so, in, the, fable, that, achilles, was, brought, up, under, chiron, the, centaur, who, was, part, a, man, and, part, a, beast, expounded, ingeniously, but, corruptly, by, machiavel, that, it, belongeth, to, the, education, and, discipline, of, princes, to, know, as, well, how, to, play, the, part, of, a, lion, in, violence, and, the, fox, in, guile, as, of, the, man, in, virtue, and, justice, nevertheless, in, many, the, like, encounters, do, rather, think, that, the, fable, was, first, and, the, exposition, devised, than, that, the, moral, was, first, and, thereupon, the, fable, framed, for, find, it, was, an, ancient, vanity, in, chrysippus, that, troubled, himself, with, great, contention, to, fasten, the, assertions, of, the, stoics, upon, the, fictions, of, the, ancient, poets, but, yet, that, all, the, fables, and, fictions, of, the, poets, were, but, pleasure, and, not, figure, interpose, no, opinion, surely, of, these, poets, which, are, now, extant, even, homer, himself, (notwithstanding, he, was, made, a, kind, of, scripture, by, the, later, schools, of, the, grecians), yet, should, without, any, difficulty, pronounce, that, his, fables, had, no, such, inwardness, in, his, own, meaning, but, what, they, might, have, upon, a, more, original, tradition, is, not, easy, to, affirm, for, he, was, not, the, inventor, of, many, of, them, (5), in, this, third, part, of, learning, which, is, poesy, can, report, no, deficience, for, being, as, a, plant, that, cometh, of, the, lust, of, the, earth, without, a, formal, seed, it, hath, sprung, up, and, spread, abroad, more, than, any, other, kind, but, to, ascribe, unto, it, that, which, is, due, for, the, expressing, of, affections, passions, corruptions, and, customs, we, are, beholding, to, poets, more, than, to, the, philosophers’, works, and, for, wit, and, eloquence, not, much, less, than, to, orators’, harangues, but, it, is, not, good, to, stay, too, long, in, the, theatre, let, us, now, pass, on, to, the, judicial, place, or, palace, of, the, mind, which, we, are, to, approach, and, view, with, more, reverence, and, attention, (1), the, knowledge, of, man, is, as, the, waters, some, descending, from, above, and, some, springing, from, beneath, the, one, informed, by, the, light, of, nature, the, other, inspired, by, divine, revelation, the, light, of, nature, consisteth, in, the, notions, of, the, mind, and, the, reports, of, the, senses, for, as, for, knowledge, which, man, receiveth, by, teaching, it, is, cumulative, and, not, original, as, in, a, water, that, besides, his, own, spring-head, is, fed, with, other, springs, and, streams, so, then, according, to, these, two, differing, illuminations, or, originals, knowledge, is, first, of, all, divided, into, divinity, and, philosophy, (2), in, philosophy, the, contemplations, of, man, do, either, penetrate, unto, god, or, are, circumferred, to, nature, or, are, reflected, or, reverted, upon, himself, out, of, which, several, inquiries, there, do, arise, three, knowledges—divine, philosophy, natural, philosophy, and, human, philosophy, or, humanity, for, all, things, are, marked, and, stamped, with, this, triple, character—the, power, of, god, the, difference, of, nature, and, the, use, of, man, but, because, the, distributions, and, partitions, of, knowledge, are, not, like, several, lines, that, meet, in, one, angle, and, so, touch, but, in, a, point, but, are, like, branches, of, a, tree, that, meet, in, a, stem, which, hath, a, dimension, and, quantity, of, entireness, and, continuance, before, it, come, to, discontinue, and, break, itself, into, arms, and, boughs, therefore, it, is, good, before, we, enter, into, the, former, distribution, to, erect, and, constitute, one, universal, science, by, the, name, of, _philosophia, prima_, primitive, or, summary, philosophy, as, the, main, and, common, way, before, we, come, where, the, ways, part, and, divide, themselves, which, science, whether, should, report, as, deficient, or, no, stand, doubtful, for, find, a, certain, rhapsody, of, natural, theology, and, of, divers, parts, of, logic, and, of, that, part, of, natural, philosophy, which, concerneth, the, principles, and, of, that, other, part, of, natural, philosophy, which, concerneth, the, soul, or, spirit—all, these, strangely, commixed, and, confused, but, being, examined, it, seemeth, to, me, rather, a, depredation, of, other, sciences, advanced, and, exalted, unto, some, height, of, terms, than, anything, solid, or, substantive, of, itself, nevertheless, cannot, be, ignorant, of, the, distinction, which, is, current, that, the, same, things, are, handled, but, in, several, respects, as, for, example, that, logic, considereth, of, many, things, as, they, are, in, notion, and, this, philosophy, as, they, are, in, nature—the, one, in, appearance, the, other, in, existence, but, find, this, difference, better, made, than, pursued, for, if, they, had, considered, quantity, similitude, diversity, and, the, rest, of, those, extern, characters, of, things, as, philosophers, and, in, nature, their, inquiries, must, of, force, have, been, of, a, far, other, kind, than, they, are, for, doth, any, of, them, in, handling, quantity, speak, of, the, force, of, union, how, and, how, far, it, multiplieth, virtue, doth, any, give, the, reason, why, some, things, in, nature, are, so, common, and, in, so, great, mass, and, others, so, rare, and, in, so, small, quantity, doth, any, in, handling, similitude, and, diversity, assign, the, cause, why, iron, should, not, move, to, iron, which, is, more, like, but, move, to, the, loadstone, which, is, less, like, why, in, all, diversities, of, things, there, should, be, certain, participles, in, nature, which, are, almost, ambiguous, to, which, kind, they, should, be, referred, but, there, is, a, mere, and, deep, silence, touching, the, nature, and, operation, of, those, common, adjuncts, of, things, as, in, nature, and, only, a, resuming, and, repeating, of, the, force, and, use, of, them, in, speech, or, argument, therefore, because, in, a, writing, of, this, nature, avoid, all, subtlety, my, meaning, touching, this, original, or, universal, philosophy, is, thus, in, a, plain, and, gross, description, by, negative, “that, it, be, a, receptacle, for, all, such, profitable, observations, and, axioms, as, fall, not, within, the, compass, of, any, of, the, special, parts, of, philosophy, or, sciences, but, are, more, common, and, of, a, higher, stage, ”, (3), now, that, there, are, many, of, that, kind, need, not, be, doubted, for, example, is, not, the, rule, _si, inœqualibus, æqualia, addas_, _omnia, erunt, inæqualia_, an, axiom, as, well, of, justice, as, of, the, mathematics, and, is, there, not, a, true, coincidence, between, commutative, and, distributive, justice, and, arithmetical, and, geometrical, proportion, is, not, that, other, rule, _quæ, in, eodem, tertio, conveniunt_, _et, inter, se, conveniunt_, a, rule, taken, from, the, mathematics, but, so, potent, in, logic, as, all, syllogisms, are, built, upon, it, is, not, the, observation, _omnia, mutantur_, _nil, interit_, a, contemplation, in, philosophy, thus, that, the, _quantum_, of, nature, is, eternal, in, natural, theology, thus, that, it, requireth, the, same, omnipotency, to, make, somewhat, nothing, which, at, the, first, made, nothing, somewhat, according, to, the, scripture, _didici, quod, omnia, opera_, _quœ, fecit, deus_, _perseverent, in, perpetuum_, _non, possumus, eis, quicquam, addere, nec, auferre_, is, not, the, ground, which, machiavel, wisely, and, largely, discourseth, concerning, governments, that, the, way, to, establish, and, preserve, them, is, to, reduce, them, _ad, principia_—a, rule, in, religion, and, nature, as, well, as, in, civil, administration, was, not, the, persian, magic, a, reduction, or, correspondence, of, the, principles, and, architectures, of, nature, to, the, rules, and, policy, of, governments, is, not, the, precept, of, a, musician, to, fall, from, a, discord, or, harsh, accord, upon, a, concord, or, sweet, accord, alike, true, in, affection, is, not, the, trope, of, music, to, avoid, or, slide, from, the, close, or, cadence, common, with, the, trope, of, rhetoric, of, deceiving, expectation, is, not, the, delight, of, the, quavering, upon, a, stop, in, music, the, same, with, the, playing, of, light, upon, the, water, “splendet, tremulo, sub, lumine, pontus, ”, are, not, the, organs, of, the, senses, of, one, kind, with, the, organs, of, reflection, the, eye, with, a, glass, the, ear, with, a, cave, or, strait, determined, and, bounded, neither, are, these, only, similitudes, as, men, of, narrow, observation, may, conceive, them, to, be, but, the, same, footsteps, of, nature, treading, or, printing, upon, several, subjects, or, matters, this, science, therefore, (as, understand, it), may, justly, report, as, deficient, for, see, sometimes, the, profounder, sort, of, wits, in, handling, some, particular, argument, will, now, and, then, draw, a, bucket, of, water, out, of, this, well, for, their, present, use, but, the, spring-head, thereof, seemeth, to, me, not, to, have, been, visited, being, of, so, excellent, use, both, for, the, disclosing, of, nature, and, the, abridgment, of, art, (1), this, science, being, therefore, first, placed, as, a, common, parent, like, unto, berecynthia, which, had, so, much, heavenly, issue, _omnes, cœlicolas_, _omnes, supera, alta, tenetes_, we, may, return, to, the, former, distribution, of, the, three, philosophies—divine, natural, and, human, and, as, concerning, divine, philosophy, or, natural, theology, it, is, that, knowledge, or, rudiment, of, knowledge, concerning, god, which, may, be, obtained, by, the, contemplation, of, his, creatures, which, knowledge, may, be, truly, termed, divine, in, respect, of, the, object, and, natural, in, respect, of, the, light, the, bounds, of, this, knowledge, are, that, it, sufficeth, to, convince, atheism, but, not, to, inform, religion, and, therefore, there, was, never, miracle, wrought, by, god, to, convert, an, atheist, because, the, light, of, nature, might, have, led, him, to, confess, a, god, but, miracles, have, been, wrought, to, convert, idolaters, and, the, superstitious, because, no, light, of, nature, extendeth, to, declare, the, will, and, true, worship, of, god, for, as, all, works, do, show, forth, the, power, and, skill, of, the, workman, and, not, his, image, so, it, is, of, the, works, of, god, which, do, show, the, omnipotency, and, wisdom, of, the, maker, but, not, his, image, and, therefore, therein, the, heathen, opinion, differeth, from, the, sacred, truth, for, they, supposed, the, world, to, be, the, image, of, god, and, man, to, be, an, extract, or, compendious, image, of, the, world, but, the, scriptures, never, vouchsafe, to, attribute, to, the, world, that, honour, as, to, be, the, image, of, god, but, only, _the, work, of, his, hands_, neither, do, they, speak, of, any, other, image, of, god, but, man, wherefore, by, the, contemplation, of, nature, to, induce, and, enforce, the, acknowledgment, of, god, and, to, demonstrate, his, power, providence, and, goodness, is, an, excellent, argument, and, hath, been, excellently, handled, by, divers, but, on, the, other, side, out, of, the, contemplation, of, nature, or, ground, of, human, knowledges, to, induce, any, verity, or, persuasion, concerning, the, points, of, faith, is, in, my, judgment, not, safe, _da, fidei, quæ, fidei, sunt_, for, the, heathen, themselves, conclude, as, much, in, that, excellent, and, divine, fable, of, the, golden, chain, “that, men, and, gods, were, not, able, to, draw, jupiter, down, to, the, earth, but, contrariwise, jupiter, was, able, to, draw, them, up, to, heaven, ”, so, as, we, ought, not, to, attempt, to, draw, down, or, submit, the, mysteries, of, god, to, our, reason, but, contrariwise, to, raise, and, advance, our, reason, to, the, divine, truth, so, as, in, this, part, of, knowledge, touching, divine, philosophy, am, so, far, from, noting, any, deficience, as, rather, note, an, excess, whereunto, have, digressed, because, of, the, extreme, prejudice, which, both, religion, and, philosophy, hath, received, and, may, receive, by, being, commixed, together, as, that, which, undoubtedly, will, make, an, heretical, religion, and, an, imaginary, and, fabulous, philosophy, (2), otherwise, it, is, of, the, nature, of, angels, and, spirits, which, is, an, appendix, of, theology, both, divine, and, natural, and, is, neither, inscrutable, nor, interdicted, for, although, the, scripture, saith, “let, no, man, deceive, you, in, sublime, discourse, touching, the, worship, of, angels, pressing, into, that, he, knoweth, not, ”, &c, yet, notwithstanding, if, you, observe, well, that, precept, it, may, appear, thereby, that, there, be, two, things, only, forbidden—adoration, of, them, and, opinion, fantastical, of, them, either, to, extol, them, further, than, appertaineth, to, the, degree, of, a, creature, or, to, extol, a, man’s, knowledge, of, them, further, than, he, hath, ground, but, the, sober, and, grounded, inquiry, which, may, arise, out, of, the, passages, of, holy, scriptures, or, out, of, the, gradations, of, nature, is, not, restrained, so, of, degenerate, and, revolted, spirits, the, conversing, with, them, or, the, employment, of, them, is, prohibited, much, more, any, veneration, towards, them, but, the, contemplation, or, science, of, their, nature, their, power, their, illusions, either, by, scripture, or, reason, is, a, part, of, spiritual, wisdom, for, so, the, apostle, saith, “we, are, not, ignorant, of, his, stratagems, ”, and, it, is, no, more, unlawful, to, inquire, the, nature, of, evil, spirits, than, to, inquire, the, force, of, poisons, in, nature, or, the, nature, of, sin, and, vice, in, morality, but, this, part, touching, angels, and, spirits, cannot, note, as, deficient, for, many, have, occupied, themselves, in, it, may, rather, challenge, it, in, many, of, the, writers, thereof, as, fabulous, and, fantastical, (1), leaving, therefore, divine, philosophy, or, natural, theology, (not, divinity, or, inspired, theology, which, we, reserve, for, the, last, of, all, as, the, haven, and, sabbath, of, all, man’s, contemplations), we, will, now, proceed, to, natural, philosophy, if, then, it, be, true, that, democritus, said, “that, the, truth, of, nature, lieth, hid, in, certain, deep, mines, and, caves, ”, and, if, it, be, true, likewise, that, the, alchemists, do, so, much, inculcate, that, vulcan, is, a, second, nature, and, imitateth, that, dexterously, and, compendiously, which, nature, worketh, by, ambages, and, length, of, time, it, were, good, to, divide, natural, philosophy, into, the, mine, and, the, furnace, and, to, make, two, professions, or, occupations, of, natural, philosophers—some, to, be, pioneers, and, some, smiths, some, to, dig, and, some, to, refine, and, hammer, and, surely, do, best, allow, of, a, division, of, that, kind, though, in, more, familiar, and, scholastical, terms, namely, that, these, be, the, two, parts, of, natural, philosophy—the, inquisition, of, causes, and, the, production, of, effects, speculative, and, operative, natural, science, and, natural, prudence, for, as, in, civil, matters, there, is, a, wisdom, of, discourse, and, a, wisdom, of, direction, so, is, it, in, natural, and, here, will, make, a, request, that, for, the, latter, (or, at, least, for, a, part, thereof), may, revive, and, reintegrate, the, misapplied, and, abused, name, of, natural, magic, which, in, the, true, sense, is, but, natural, wisdom, or, natural, prudence, taken, according, to, the, ancient, acception, purged, from, vanity, and, superstition, now, although, it, be, true, and, know, it, well, that, there, is, an, intercourse, between, causes, and, effects, so, as, both, these, knowledges, speculative, and, operative, have, a, great, connection, between, themselves, yet, because, all, true, and, fruitful, natural, philosophy, hath, a, double, scale, or, ladder, ascendent, and, descendent, ascending, from, experiments, to, the, invention, of, causes, and, descending, from, causes, to, the, invention, of, new, experiments, therefore, judge, it, most, requisite, that, these, two, parts, be, severally, considered, and, handled, (2), natural, science, or, theory, is, divided, into, physic, and, metaphysic, wherein, desire, it, may, be, conceived, that, use, the, word, metaphysic, in, a, differing, sense, from, that, that, is, received, and, in, like, manner, doubt, not, but, it, will, easily, appear, to, men, of, judgment, that, in, this, and, other, particulars, wheresoever, my, conception, and, notion, may, differ, from, the, ancient, yet, am, studious, to, keep, the, ancient, terms, for, hoping, well, to, deliver, myself, from, mistaking, by, the, order, and, perspicuous, expressing, of, that, do, propound, am, otherwise, zealous, and, affectionate, to, recede, as, little, from, antiquity, either, in, terms, or, opinions, as, may, stand, with, truth, and, the, proficience, of, knowledge, and, herein, cannot, a, little, marvel, at, the, philosopher, aristotle, that, did, proceed, in, such, a, spirit, of, difference, and, contradiction, towards, all, antiquity, undertaking, not, only, to, frame, new, words, of, science, at, pleasure, but, to, confound, and, extinguish, all, ancient, wisdom, insomuch, as, he, never, nameth, or, mentioneth, an, ancient, author, or, opinion, but, to, confute, and, reprove, wherein, for, glory, and, drawing, followers, and, disciples, he, took, the, right, course, for, certainly, there, cometh, to, pass, and, hath, place, in, human, truth, that, which, was, noted, and, pronounced, in, the, highest, truth, —_veni, in, nomine, partis_, _nec, recipits, me_, _si, quis, venerit, in, nomine, suo, eum, recipietis_, but, in, this, divine, aphorism, (considering, to, whom, it, was, applied, namely, to, antichrist, the, highest, deceiver), we, may, discern, well, that, the, coming, in, a, man’s, own, name, without, regard, of, antiquity, or, paternity, is, no, good, sign, of, truth, although, it, be, joined, with, the, fortune, and, success, of, an, _eum, recipietis_, but, for, this, excellent, person, aristotle, will, think, of, him, that, he, learned, that, humour, of, his, scholar, with, whom, it, seemeth, he, did, emulate, the, one, to, conquer, all, opinions, as, the, other, to, conquer, all, nations, wherein, nevertheless, it, may, be, he, may, at, some, men’s, hands, that, are, of, a, bitter, disposition, get, a, like, title, as, his, scholar, did, —, “felix, terrarum, prædo, non, utile, mundo, editus, exemplum, &c, ”, so, “felix, doctrinæ, prædo, ”, but, to, me, on, the, other, side, that, do, desire, as, much, as, lieth, in, my, pen, to, ground, a, sociable, intercourse, between, antiquity, and, proficience, it, seemeth, best, to, keep, way, with, antiquity, _usque, ad, aras_, and, therefore, to, retain, the, ancient, terms, though, sometimes, alter, the, uses, and, definitions, according, to, the, moderate, proceeding, in, civil, government, where, although, there, be, some, alteration, yet, that, holdeth, which, tacitus, wisely, noteth, _eadem, magistratuum, vocabula_, (3), to, return, therefore, to, the, use, and, acception, of, the, term, metaphysic, as, do, now, understand, the, word, it, appeareth, by, that, which, hath, been, already, said, that, intend, _philosophia, prima_, summary, philosophy, and, metaphysic, which, heretofore, have, been, confounded, as, one, to, be, two, distinct, things, for, the, one, have, made, as, a, parent, or, common, ancestor, to, all, knowledge, and, the, other, have, now, brought, in, as, a, branch, or, descendant, of, natural, science, it, appeareth, likewise, that, have, assigned, to, summary, philosophy, the, common, principles, and, axioms, which, are, promiscuous, and, indifferent, to, several, sciences, have, assigned, unto, it, likewise, the, inquiry, touching, the, operation, or, the, relative, and, adventive, characters, of, essences, as, quantity, similitude, diversity, possibility, and, the, rest, with, this, distinction, and, provision, that, they, be, handled, as, they, have, efficacy, in, nature, and, not, logically, it, appeareth, likewise, that, natural, theology, which, heretofore, hath, been, handled, confusedly, with, metaphysic, have, enclosed, and, bounded, by, itself, it, is, therefore, now, a, question, what, is, left, remaining, for, metaphysic, wherein, may, without, prejudice, preserve, thus, much, of, the, conceit, of, antiquity, that, physic, should, contemplate, that, which, is, inherent, in, matter, and, therefore, transitory, and, metaphysic, that, which, is, abstracted, and, fixed, and, again, that, physic, should, handle, that, which, supposeth, in, nature, only, a, being, and, moving, and, metaphysic, should, handle, that, which, supposeth, further, in, nature, a, reason, understanding, and, platform, but, the, difference, perspicuously, expressed, is, most, familiar, and, sensible, for, as, we, divided, natural, philosophy, in, general, into, the, inquiry, of, causes, and, productions, of, effects, so, that, part, which, concerneth, the, inquiry, of, causes, we, do, subdivide, according, to, the, received, and, sound, division, of, causes, the, one, part, which, is, physic, inquireth, and, handleth, the, material, and, efficient, causes, and, the, other, which, is, metaphysic, handleth, the, formal, and, final, causes, (4), physic, (taking, it, according, to, the, derivation, and, not, according, to, our, idiom, for, medicine), is, situate, in, a, middle, term, or, distance, between, natural, history, and, metaphysic, for, natural, history, describeth, the, variety, of, things, physic, the, causes, but, variable, or, respective, causes, and, metaphysic, the, fixed, and, constant, causes, “limus, ut, hic, durescit, et, hæc, ut, cera, liquescit, uno, eodemque, igni, ”, fire, is, the, cause, of, induration, but, respective, to, clay, fire, is, the, cause, of, colliquation, but, respective, to, wax, but, fire, is, no, constant, cause, either, of, induration, or, colliquation, so, then, the, physical, causes, are, but, the, efficient, and, the, matter, physic, hath, three, parts, whereof, two, respect, nature, united, or, collected, the, third, contemplateth, nature, diffused, or, distributed, nature, is, collected, either, into, one, entire, total, or, else, into, the, same, principles, or, seeds, so, as, the, first, doctrine, is, touching, the, contexture, or, configuration, of, things, as, _de, mundo_, _de, universitate, rerum_, the, second, is, the, doctrine, concerning, the, principles, or, originals, of, things, the, third, is, the, doctrine, concerning, all, variety, and, particularity, of, things, whether, it, be, of, the, differing, substances, or, their, differing, qualities, and, natures, whereof, there, needeth, no, enumeration, this, part, being, but, as, a, gloss, or, paraphrase, that, attendeth, upon, the, text, of, natural, history, of, these, three, cannot, report, any, as, deficient, in, what, truth, or, perfection, they, are, handled, make, not, now, any, judgment, but, they, are, parts, of, knowledge, not, deserted, by, the, labour, of, man, (5), for, metaphysic, we, have, assigned, unto, it, the, inquiry, of, formal, and, final, causes, which, assignation, as, to, the, former, of, them, may, seem, to, be, nugatory, and, void, because, of, the, received, and, inveterate, opinion, that, the, inquisition, of, man, is, not, competent, to, find, out, essential, forms, or, true, differences, of, which, opinion, we, will, take, this, hold, that, the, invention, of, forms, is, of, all, other, parts, of, knowledge, the, worthiest, to, be, sought, if, it, be, possible, to, be, found, as, for, the, possibility, they, are, ill, discoverers, that, think, there, is, no, land, when, they, can, see, nothing, but, sea, but, it, is, manifest, that, plato, in, his, opinion, of, ideas, as, one, that, had, a, wit, of, elevation, situate, as, upon, a, cliff, did, descry, that, forms, were, the, true, object, of, knowledge, but, lost, the, real, fruit, of, his, opinion, by, considering, of, forms, as, absolutely, abstracted, from, matter, and, not, confined, and, determined, by, matter, and, so, turning, his, opinion, upon, theology, wherewith, all, his, natural, philosophy, is, infected, but, if, any, man, shall, keep, a, continual, watchful, and, severe, eye, upon, action, operation, and, the, use, of, knowledge, he, may, advise, and, take, notice, what, are, the, forms, the, disclosures, whereof, are, fruitful, and, important, to, the, state, of, man, for, as, to, the, forms, of, substances, (man, only, except, of, whom, it, is, said, _formavit, hominem, de, limo, terræ_, _et, spiravit, in, faciem, ejus, spiraculum, vitæ_, and, not, as, of, all, other, creatures, _producant, aquæ_, _producat, terra_), the, forms, of, substances, say, (as, they, are, now, by, compounding, and, transplanting, multiplied), are, so, perplexed, as, they, are, not, to, be, inquired, no, more, than, it, were, either, possible, or, to, purpose, to, seek, in, gross, the, forms, of, those, sounds, which, make, words, which, by, composition, and, transposition, of, letters, are, infinite, but, on, the, other, side, to, inquire, the, form, of, those, sounds, or, voices, which, make, simple, letters, is, easily, comprehensible, and, being, known, induceth, and, manifesteth, the, forms, of, all, words, which, consist, and, are, compounded, of, them, in, the, same, manner, to, inquire, the, form, of, a, lion, of, an, oak, of, gold, nay, of, water, of, air, is, a, vain, pursuit, but, to, inquire, the, forms, of, sense, of, voluntary, motion, of, vegetation, of, colours, of, gravity, and, levity, of, density, of, tenuity, of, heat, of, cold, and, all, other, natures, and, qualities, which, like, an, alphabet, are, not, many, and, of, which, the, essences, (upheld, by, matter), of, all, creatures, do, consist, to, inquire, say, the, true, forms, of, these, is, that, part, of, metaphysic, which, we, now, define, of, not, but, that, physic, doth, make, inquiry, and, take, consideration, of, the, same, natures, but, how, only, as, to, the, material, and, efficient, causes, of, them, and, not, as, to, the, forms, for, example, if, the, cause, of, whiteness, in, snow, or, froth, be, inquired, and, it, be, rendered, thus, that, the, subtle, intermixture, of, air, and, water, is, the, cause, it, is, well, rendered, but, nevertheless, is, this, the, form, of, whiteness, no, but, it, is, the, efficient, which, is, ever, but, _vehiculum, formæ_, this, part, of, metaphysic, do, not, find, laboured, and, performed, whereat, marvel, not, because, hold, it, not, possible, to, be, invented, by, that, course, of, invention, which, hath, been, used, in, regard, that, men, (which, is, the, root, of, all, error), have, made, too, untimely, a, departure, and, too, remote, a, recess, from, particulars, (6), but, the, use, of, this, part, of, metaphysic, which, report, as, deficient, is, of, the, rest, the, most, excellent, in, two, respects, the, one, because, it, is, the, duty, and, virtue, of, all, knowledge, to, abridge, the, infinity, of, individual, experience, as, much, as, the, conception, of, truth, will, permit, and, to, remedy, the, complaint, of, _vita, brevis_, _ars, longa_, which, is, performed, by, uniting, the, notions, and, conceptions, of, sciences, for, knowledges, are, as, pyramids, whereof, history, is, the, basis, so, of, natural, philosophy, the, basis, is, natural, history, the, stage, next, the, basis, is, physic, the, stage, next, the, vertical, point, is, metaphysic, as, for, the, vertical, point, _opus, quod, operatur, deus, à, principio, usque, ad, finem_, the, summary, law, of, nature, we, know, not, whether, man’s, inquiry, can, attain, unto, it, but, these, three, be, the, true, stages, of, knowledge, and, are, to, them, that, are, depraved, no, better, than, the, giants’, hills, —, “ter, sunt, conati, imponere, pelio, ossam, scilicet, atque, ossæ, frondsum, involvere, olympum, ”, but, to, those, which, refer, all, things, to, the, glory, of, god, they, are, as, the, three, acclamations, _sante_, _sancte_, _sancte_, holy, in, the, description, or, dilatation, of, his, works, holy, in, the, connection, or, concatenation, of, them, and, holy, in, the, union, of, them, in, a, perpetual, and, uniform, law, and, therefore, the, speculation, was, excellent, in, parmenides, and, plato, although, but, a, speculation, in, them, that, all, things, by, scale, did, ascend, to, unity, so, then, always, that, knowledge, is, worthiest, which, is, charged, with, least, multiplicity, which, appeareth, to, be, metaphysic, as, that, which, considereth, the, simple, forms, or, differences, of, things, which, are, few, in, number, and, the, degrees, and, co-ordinations, whereof, make, all, this, variety, the, second, respect, which, valueth, and, commendeth, this, part, of, metaphysic, is, that, it, doth, enfranchise, the, power, of, man, unto, the, greatest, liberty, and, possibility, of, works, and, effects, for, physic, carrieth, men, in, narrow, and, restrained, ways, subject, to, many, accidents, and, impediments, imitating, the, ordinary, flexuous, courses, of, nature, but, _latæ, undique, sunt, sapientibus, viæ_, to, sapience, (which, was, anciently, defined, to, be, _rerum, divinarum, et, humanarum, scientia_), there, is, ever, a, choice, of, means, for, physical, causes, give, light, to, new, invention, in, _simili, materia_, but, whosoever, knoweth, any, form, knoweth, the, utmost, possibility, of, superinducing, that, nature, upon, any, variety, of, matter, and, so, is, less, restrained, in, operation, either, to, the, basis, of, the, matter, or, the, condition, of, the, efficient, which, kind, of, knowledge, solomon, likewise, though, in, a, more, divine, sense, elegantly, describeth, _non, arctabuntur, gressus, tui_, _et, currens, non, habebis, offendiculum_, the, ways, of, sapience, are, not, much, liable, either, to, particularity, or, chance, (7), the, second, part, of, metaphysic, is, the, inquiry, of, final, causes, which, am, moved, to, report, not, as, omitted, but, as, misplaced, and, yet, if, it, were, but, a, fault, in, order, would, not, speak, of, it, for, order, is, matter, of, illustration, but, pertaineth, not, to, the, substance, of, sciences, but, this, misplacing, hath, caused, a, deficience, or, at, least, a, great, improficience, in, the, sciences, themselves, for, the, handling, of, final, causes, mixed, with, the, rest, in, physical, inquiries, hath, intercepted, the, severe, and, diligent, inquiry, of, all, real, and, physical, causes, and, given, men, the, occasion, to, stay, upon, these, satisfactory, and, specious, causes, to, the, great, arrest, and, prejudice, of, further, discovery, for, this, find, done, not, only, by, plato, who, ever, anchoreth, upon, that, shore, but, by, aristotle, galen, and, others, which, do, usually, likewise, fall, upon, these, flats, of, discoursing, causes, for, to, say, that, “the, hairs, of, the, eyelids, are, for, a, quickset, and, fence, about, the, sight, ”, or, that, “the, firmness, of, the, skins, and, hides, of, living, creatures, is, to, defend, them, from, the, extremities, of, heat, or, cold, ”, or, that, “the, bones, are, for, the, columns, or, beams, whereupon, the, frames, of, the, bodies, of, living, creatures, are, built, ”, or, that, “the, leaves, of, trees, are, for, protecting, of, the, fruit, ”, or, that, “the, clouds, are, for, watering, of, the, earth, ”, or, that, “the, solidness, of, the, earth, is, for, the, station, and, mansion, of, living, creatures, ”, and, the, like, is, well, inquired, and, collected, in, metaphysic, but, in, physic, they, are, impertinent, nay, they, are, indeed, but, _remoras_, and, hindrances, to, stay, and, slug, the, ship, from, further, sailing, and, have, brought, this, to, pass, that, the, search, of, the, physical, causes, hath, been, neglected, and, passed, in, silence, and, therefore, the, natural, philosophy, of, democritus, and, some, others, who, did, not, suppose, a, mind, or, reason, in, the, frame, of, things, but, attributed, the, form, thereof, able, to, maintain, itself, to, infinite, essays, or, proofs, of, nature, which, they, term, fortune, seemeth, to, me, (as, far, as, can, judge, by, the, recital, and, fragments, which, remain, unto, us), in, particularities, of, physical, causes, more, real, and, better, inquired, than, that, of, aristotle, and, plato, whereof, both, intermingled, final, causes, the, one, as, a, part, of, theology, and, the, other, as, a, part, of, logic, which, were, the, favourite, studies, respectively, of, both, those, persons, not, because, those, final, causes, are, not, true, and, worthy, to, be, inquired, being, kept, within, their, own, province, but, because, their, excursions, into, the, limits, of, physical, causes, hath, bred, a, vastness, and, solitude, in, that, tract, for, otherwise, keeping, their, precincts, and, borders, men, are, extremely, deceived, if, they, think, there, is, an, enmity, or, repugnancy, at, all, between, them, for, the, cause, rendered, that, “the, hairs, about, the, eyelids, are, for, the, safeguard, of, the, sight, ”, doth, not, impugn, the, cause, rendered, that, “pilosity, is, incident, to, orifices, of, moisture—_muscosi, fontes_, &c, ”, nor, the, cause, rendered, that, “the, firmness, of, hides, is, for, the, armour, of, the, body, against, extremities, of, heat, or, cold, ”, doth, not, impugn, the, cause, rendered, that, “contraction, of, pores, is, incident, to, the, outwardest, parts, in, regard, of, their, adjacence, to, foreign, or, unlike, bodies, ”, and, so, of, the, rest, both, causes, being, true, and, compatible, the, one, declaring, an, intention, the, other, a, consequence, only, neither, doth, this, call, in, question, or, derogate, from, divine, providence, but, highly, confirm, and, exalt, it, for, as, in, civil, actions, he, is, the, greater, and, deeper, politique, that, can, make, other, men, the, instruments, of, his, will, and, ends, and, yet, never, acquaint, them, with, his, purpose, so, as, they, shall, do, it, and, yet, not, know, what, they, do, than, he, that, imparteth, his, meaning, to, those, he, employeth, so, is, the, wisdom, of, god, more, admirable, when, nature, intendeth, one, thing, and, providence, draweth, forth, another, than, if, he, had, communicated, to, particular, creatures, and, motions, the, characters, and, impressions, of, his, providence, and, thus, much, for, metaphysic, the, latter, part, whereof, allow, as, extant, but, wish, it, confined, to, his, proper, place, (1), nevertheless, there, remaineth, yet, another, part, of, natural, philosophy, which, is, commonly, made, a, principal, part, and, holdeth, rank, with, physic, special, and, metaphysic, which, is, mathematic, but, think, it, more, agreeable, to, the, nature, of, things, and, to, the, light, of, order, to, place, it, as, a, branch, of, metaphysic, for, the, subject, of, it, being, quantity, not, quantity, indefinite, which, is, but, a, relative, and, belongeth, to, _philosophia, prima_, (as, hath, been, said), but, quantity, determined, or, proportionable, it, appeareth, to, be, one, of, the, essential, forms, of, things, as, that, that, is, causative, in, nature, of, a, number, of, effects, insomuch, as, we, see, in, the, schools, both, of, democritus, and, of, pythagoras, that, the, one, did, ascribe, figure, to, the, first, seeds, of, things, and, the, other, did, suppose, numbers, to, be, the, principles, and, originals, of, things, and, it, is, true, also, that, of, all, other, forms, (as, we, understand, forms), it, is, the, most, abstracted, and, separable, from, matter, and, therefore, most, proper, to, metaphysic, which, hath, likewise, been, the, cause, why, it, hath, been, better, laboured, and, inquired, than, any, of, the, other, forms, which, are, more, immersed, in, matter, for, it, being, the, nature, of, the, mind, of, man, (to, the, extreme, prejudice, of, knowledge), to, delight, in, the, spacious, liberty, of, generalities, as, in, a, champaign, region, and, not, in, the, inclosures, of, particularity, the, mathematics, of, all, other, knowledge, were, the, goodliest, fields, to, satisfy, that, appetite, but, for, the, placing, of, this, science, it, is, not, much, material, only, we, have, endeavoured, in, these, our, partitions, to, observe, a, kind, of, perspective, that, one, part, may, cast, light, upon, another, (2), the, mathematics, are, either, pure, or, mixed, to, the, pure, mathematics, are, those, sciences, belonging, which, handle, quantity, determinate, merely, severed, from, any, axioms, of, natural, philosophy, and, these, are, two, geometry, and, arithmetic, the, one, handling, quantity, continued, and, the, other, dissevered, mixed, hath, for, subject, some, axioms, or, parts, of, natural, philosophy, and, considereth, quantity, determined, as, it, is, auxiliary, and, incident, unto, them, for, many, parts, of, nature, can, neither, be, invented, with, sufficient, subtlety, nor, demonstrated, with, sufficient, perspicuity, nor, accommodated, unto, use, with, sufficient, dexterity, without, the, aid, and, intervening, of, the, mathematics, of, which, sort, are, perspective, music, astronomy, cosmography, architecture, engineery, and, divers, others, in, the, mathematics, can, report, no, deficience, except, it, be, that, men, do, not, sufficiently, understand, this, excellent, use, of, the, pure, mathematics, in, that, they, do, remedy, and, cure, many, defects, in, the, wit, and, faculties, intellectual, for, if, the, wit, be, too, dull, they, sharpen, it, if, too, wandering, they, fix, it, if, too, inherent, in, the, sense, they, abstract, it, so, that, as, tennis, is, a, game, of, no, use, in, itself, but, of, great, use, in, respect, it, maketh, a, quick, eye, and, a, body, ready, to, put, itself, into, all, postures, so, in, the, mathematics, that, use, which, is, collateral, and, intervenient, is, no, less, worthy, than, that, which, is, principal, and, intended, and, as, for, the, mixed, mathematics, may, only, make, this, prediction, that, there, cannot, fail, to, be, more, kinds, of, them, as, nature, grows, further, disclosed, thus, much, of, natural, science, or, the, part, of, nature, speculative, (3), for, natural, prudence, or, the, part, operative, of, natural, philosophy, we, will, divide, it, into, three, parts—experimental, philosophical, and, magical, which, three, parts, active, have, a, correspondence, and, analogy, with, the, three, parts, speculative, natural, history, physic, and, metaphysic, for, many, operations, have, been, invented, sometimes, by, a, casual, incidence, and, occurrence, sometimes, by, a, purposed, experiment, and, of, those, which, have, been, found, by, an, intentional, experiment, some, have, been, found, out, by, varying, or, extending, the, same, experiment, some, by, transferring, and, compounding, divers, experiments, the, one, into, the, other, which, kind, of, invention, an, empiric, may, manage, again, by, the, knowledge, of, physical, causes, there, cannot, fail, to, follow, many, indications, and, designations, of, new, particulars, if, men, in, their, speculation, will, keep, one, eye, upon, use, and, practice, but, these, are, but, coastings, along, the, shore, _premendo, littus, iniquum_, for, it, seemeth, to, me, there, can, hardly, be, discovered, any, radical, or, fundamental, alterations, and, innovations, in, nature, either, by, the, fortune, and, essays, of, experiments, or, by, the, light, and, direction, of, physical, causes, if, therefore, we, have, reported, metaphysic, deficient, it, must, follow, that, we, do, the, like, of, natural, magic, which, hath, relation, thereunto, for, as, for, the, natural, magic, whereof, now, there, is, mention, in, books, containing, certain, credulous, and, superstitious, conceits, and, observations, of, sympathies, and, antipathies, and, hidden, proprieties, and, some, frivolous, experiments, strange, rather, by, disguisement, than, in, themselves, it, is, as, far, differing, in, truth, of, nature, from, such, a, knowledge, as, we, require, as, the, story, of, king, arthur, of, britain, or, hugh, of, bourdeaux, differs, from, cæsar’s, commentaries, in, truth, of, story, for, it, is, manifest, that, cæsar, did, greater, things, _de, vero_, than, those, imaginary, heroes, were, feigned, to, do, but, he, did, them, not, in, that, fabulous, manner, of, this, kind, of, learning, the, fable, of, ixion, was, a, figure, who, designed, to, enjoy, juno, the, goddess, of, power, and, instead, of, her, had, copulation, with, a, cloud, of, which, mixture, were, begotten, centaurs, and, chimeras, so, whosoever, shall, entertain, high, and, vaporous, imaginations, instead, of, a, laborious, and, sober, inquiry, of, truth, shall, beget, hopes, and, beliefs, of, strange, and, impossible, shapes, and, therefore, we, may, note, in, these, sciences, which, hold, so, much, of, imagination, and, belief, as, this, degenerate, natural, magic, alchemy, astrology, and, the, like, that, in, their, propositions, the, description, of, the, means, is, ever, more, monstrous, than, the, pretence, or, end, for, it, is, a, thing, more, probable, that, he, that, knoweth, well, the, natures, of, weight, of, colour, of, pliant, and, fragile, in, respect, of, the, hammer, of, volatile, and, fixed, in, respect, of, the, fire, and, the, rest, may, superinduce, upon, some, metal, the, nature, and, form, of, gold, by, such, mechanic, as, longeth, to, the, production, of, the, natures, afore, rehearsed, than, that, some, grains, of, the, medicine, projected, should, in, a, few, moments, of, time, turn, a, sea, of, quicksilver, or, other, material, into, gold, so, it, is, more, probable, that, he, that, knoweth, the, nature, of, arefaction, the, nature, of, assimilation, of, nourishment, to, the, thing, nourished, the, manner, of, increase, and, clearing, of, spirits, the, manner, of, the, depredations, which, spirits, make, upon, the, humours, and, solid, parts, shall, by, ambages, of, diets, bathings, anointings, medicines, motions, and, the, like, prolong, life, or, restore, some, degree, of, youth, or, vivacity, than, that, it, can, be, done, with, the, use, of, a, few, drops, or, scruples, of, a, liquor, or, receipt, to, conclude, therefore, the, true, natural, magic, which, is, that, great, liberty, and, latitude, of, operation, which, dependeth, upon, the, knowledge, of, forms, may, report, deficient, as, the, relative, thereof, is, to, which, part, if, we, be, serious, and, incline, not, to, vanities, and, plausible, discourse, besides, the, deriving, and, deducing, the, operations, themselves, from, metaphysic, there, are, pertinent, two, points, of, much, purpose, the, one, by, way, of, preparation, the, other, by, way, of, caution, the, first, is, that, there, be, made, a, calendar, resembling, an, inventory, of, the, estate, of, man, containing, all, the, inventions, (being, the, works, or, fruits, of, nature, or, art), which, are, now, extant, and, whereof, man, is, already, possessed, out, of, which, doth, naturally, result, a, note, what, things, are, yet, held, impossible, or, not, invented, which, calendar, will, be, the, more, artificial, and, serviceable, if, to, every, reputed, impossibility, you, add, what, thing, is, extant, which, cometh, the, nearest, in, degree, to, that, impossibility, to, the, end, that, by, these, optatives, and, potentials, man’s, inquiry, may, be, the, more, awake, in, deducing, direction, of, works, from, the, speculation, of, causes, and, secondly, that, these, experiments, be, not, only, esteemed, which, have, an, immediate, and, present, use, but, those, principally, which, are, of, most, universal, consequence, for, invention, of, other, experiments, and, those, which, give, most, light, to, the, invention, of, causes, for, the, invention, of, the, mariner’s, needle, which, giveth, the, direction, is, of, no, less, benefit, for, navigation, than, the, invention, of, the, sails, which, give, the, motion, (4), thus, have, passed, through, natural, philosophy, and, the, deficiences, thereof, wherein, if, have, differed, from, the, ancient, and, received, doctrines, and, thereby, shall, move, contradiction, for, my, part, as, affect, not, to, dissent, so, purpose, not, to, contend, if, it, be, truth, “non, canimus, surdis, respondent, omnia, sylvæ, ”, the, voice, of, nature, will, consent, whether, the, voice, of, man, do, or, no, and, as, alexander, borgia, was, wont, to, say, of, the, expedition, of, the, french, for, naples, that, they, came, with, chalk, in, their, hands, to, mark, up, their, lodgings, and, not, with, weapons, to, fight, so, like, better, that, entry, of, truth, which, cometh, peaceably, with, chalk, to, mark, up, those, minds, which, are, capable, to, lodge, and, harbour, it, than, that, which, cometh, with, pugnacity, and, contention, (5), but, there, remaineth, a, division, of, natural, philosophy, according, to, the, report, of, the, inquiry, and, nothing, concerning, the, matter, or, subject, and, that, is, positive, and, considerative, when, the, inquiry, reporteth, either, an, assertion, or, a, doubt, these, doubts, or, _non, liquets_, are, of, two, sorts, particular, and, total, for, the, first, we, see, a, good, example, thereof, in, aristotle’s, problems, which, deserved, to, have, had, a, better, continuance, but, so, nevertheless, as, there, is, one, point, whereof, warning, is, to, be, given, and, taken, the, registering, of, doubts, hath, two, excellent, uses, the, one, that, it, saveth, philosophy, from, errors, and, falsehoods, when, that, which, is, not, fully, appearing, is, not, collected, into, assertion, whereby, error, might, draw, error, but, reserved, in, doubt, the, other, that, the, entry, of, doubts, are, as, so, many, suckers, or, sponges, to, draw, use, of, knowledge, insomuch, as, that, which, if, doubts, had, not, preceded, a, man, should, never, have, advised, but, passed, it, over, without, note, by, the, suggestion, and, solicitation, of, doubts, is, made, to, be, attended, and, applied, but, both, these, commodities, do, scarcely, countervail, and, inconvenience, which, will, intrude, itself, if, it, be, not, debarred, which, is, that, when, a, doubt, is, once, received, men, labour, rather, how, to, keep, it, a, doubt, still, than, how, to, solve, it, and, accordingly, bend, their, wits, of, this, we, see, the, familiar, example, in, lawyers, and, scholars, both, which, if, they, have, once, admitted, a, doubt, it, goeth, ever, after, authorised, for, a, doubt, but, that, use, of, wit, and, knowledge, is, to, be, allowed, which, laboureth, to, make, doubtful, things, certain, and, not, those, which, labour, to, make, certain, things, doubtful, therefore, these, calendars, of, doubts, commend, as, excellent, things, so, that, there, he, this, caution, used, that, when, they, be, thoroughly, sifted, and, brought, to, resolution, they, be, from, thenceforth, omitted, discarded, and, not, continued, to, cherish, and, encourage, men, in, doubting, to, which, calendar, of, doubts, or, problems, advise, be, annexed, another, calendar, as, much, or, more, material, which, is, a, calendar, of, popular, errors, mean, chiefly, in, natural, history, such, as, pass, in, speech, and, conceit, and, are, nevertheless, apparently, detected, and, convicted, of, untruth, that, man’s, knowledge, be, not, weakened, nor, embased, by, such, dross, and, vanity, as, for, the, doubts, or, _non, liquets_, general, or, in, total, understand, those, differences, of, opinions, touching, the, principles, of, nature, and, the, fundamental, points, of, the, same, which, have, caused, the, diversity, of, sects, schools, and, philosophies, as, that, of, empedocles, pythagoras, democritus, parmenides, and, the, rest, for, although, aristotle, as, though, he, had, been, of, the, race, of, the, ottomans, thought, he, could, not, reign, except, the, first, thing, he, did, he, killed, all, his, brethren, yet, to, those, that, seek, truth, and, not, magistrality, it, cannot, but, seem, a, matter, of, great, profit, to, see, before, them, the, several, opinions, touching, the, foundations, of, nature, not, for, any, exact, truth, that, can, be, expected, in, those, theories, for, as, the, same, phenomena, in, astronomy, are, satisfied, by, this, received, astronomy, of, the, diurnal, motion, and, the, proper, motions, of, the, planets, with, their, eccentrics, and, epicycles, and, likewise, by, the, theory, of, copernicus, who, supposed, the, earth, to, move, and, the, calculations, are, indifferently, agreeable, to, both, so, the, ordinary, face, and, view, of, experience, is, many, times, satisfied, by, several, theories, and, philosophies, whereas, to, find, the, real, truth, requireth, another, manner, of, severity, and, attention, for, as, aristotle, saith, that, children, at, the, first, will, call, every, woman, mother, but, afterward, they, come, to, distinguish, according, to, truth, so, experience, if, it, be, in, childhood, will, call, every, philosophy, mother, but, when, it, cometh, to, ripeness, it, will, discern, the, true, mother, so, as, in, the, meantime, it, is, good, to, see, the, several, glosses, and, opinions, upon, nature, whereof, it, may, be, everyone, in, some, one, point, hath, seen, clearer, than, his, fellows, therefore, wish, some, collection, to, be, made, painfully, and, understandingly, _de, antiquis, philosophiis_, out, of, all, the, possible, light, which, remaineth, to, us, of, them, which, kind, of, work, find, deficient, but, here, must, give, warning, that, it, be, done, distinctly, and, severedly, the, philosophies, of, everyone, throughout, by, themselves, and, not, by, titles, packed, and, faggoted, up, together, as, hath, been, done, by, plutarch, for, it, is, the, harmony, of, a, philosophy, in, itself, which, giveth, it, light, and, credence, whereas, if, it, be, singled, and, broken, it, will, seem, more, foreign, and, dissonant, for, as, when, read, in, tacitus, the, actions, of, nero, or, claudius, with, circumstances, of, times, inducements, and, occasions, find, them, not, so, strange, but, when, read, them, in, suetonius, tranquillus, gathered, into, titles, and, bundles, and, not, in, order, of, time, they, seem, more, monstrous, and, incredible, so, is, it, of, any, philosophy, reported, entire, and, dismembered, by, articles, neither, do, exclude, opinions, of, latter, times, to, be, likewise, represented, in, this, calendar, of, sects, of, philosophy, as, that, of, theophrastus, paracelsus, eloquently, reduced, into, an, harmony, by, the, pen, of, severinus, the, dane, and, that, of, tilesius, and, his, scholar, donius, being, as, a, pastoral, philosophy, full, of, sense, but, of, no, great, depth, and, that, of, fracastorius, who, though, he, pretended, not, to, make, any, new, philosophy, yet, did, use, the, absoluteness, of, his, own, sense, upon, the, old, and, that, of, gilbertus, our, countryman, who, revived, with, some, alterations, and, demonstrations, the, opinions, of, xenophanes, and, any, other, worthy, to, be, admitted, (6), thus, have, we, now, dealt, with, two, of, the, three, beams, of, man’s, knowledge, that, is, _radius, directus_, which, is, referred, to, nature, _radius, refractus_, which, is, referred, to, god, and, cannot, report, truly, because, of, the, inequality, of, the, medium, there, resteth, _radius, reflexus_, whereby, man, beholdeth, and, contemplateth, himself, (1), we, come, therefore, now, to, that, knowledge, whereunto, the, ancient, oracle, directeth, us, which, is, the, knowledge, of, ourselves, which, deserveth, the, more, accurate, handling, by, how, much, it, toucheth, us, more, nearly, this, knowledge, as, it, is, the, end, and, term, of, natural, philosophy, in, the, intention, of, man, so, notwithstanding, it, is, but, a, portion, of, natural, philosophy, in, the, continent, of, nature, and, generally, let, this, be, a, rule, that, all, partitions, of, knowledges, be, accepted, rather, for, lines, and, veins, than, for, sections, and, separations, and, that, the, continuance, and, entireness, of, knowledge, be, preserved, for, the, contrary, hereof, hath, made, particular, sciences, to, become, barren, shallow, and, erroneous, while, they, have, not, been, nourished, and, maintained, from, the, common, fountain, so, we, see, cicero, the, orator, complained, of, socrates, and, his, school, that, he, was, the, first, that, separated, philosophy, and, rhetoric, whereupon, rhetoric, became, an, empty, and, verbal, art, so, we, may, see, that, the, opinion, of, copernicus, touching, the, rotation, of, the, earth, which, astronomy, itself, cannot, correct, because, it, is, not, repugnant, to, any, of, the, _phenomena_, yet, natural, philosophy, may, correct, so, we, see, also, that, the, science, of, medicine, if, it, be, destituted, and, forsaken, by, natural, philosophy, it, is, not, much, better, than, an, empirical, practice, with, this, reservation, therefore, we, proceed, to, human, philosophy, or, humanity, which, hath, two, parts, the, one, considereth, man, segregate, or, distributively, the, other, congregate, or, in, society, so, as, human, philosophy, is, either, simple, and, particular, or, conjugate, and, civil, humanity, particular, consisteth, of, the, same, parts, whereof, man, consisteth, that, is, of, knowledges, which, respect, the, body, and, of, knowledges, that, respect, the, mind, but, before, we, distribute, so, far, it, is, good, to, constitute, for, do, take, the, consideration, in, general, and, at, large, of, human, nature, to, be, fit, to, be, emancipate, and, made, a, knowledge, by, itself, not, so, much, in, regard, of, those, delightful, and, elegant, discourses, which, have, been, made, of, the, dignity, of, man, of, his, miseries, of, his, state, and, life, and, the, like, adjuncts, of, his, common, and, undivided, nature, but, chiefly, in, regard, of, the, knowledge, concerning, the, sympathies, and, concordances, between, the, mind, and, body, which, being, mixed, cannot, be, properly, assigned, to, the, sciences, of, either, (2), this, knowledge, hath, two, branches, for, as, all, leagues, and, amities, consist, of, mutual, intelligence, and, mutual, offices, so, this, league, of, mind, and, body, hath, these, two, parts, how, the, one, discloseth, the, other, and, how, the, one, worketh, upon, the, other, discovery, and, impression, the, former, of, these, hath, begotten, two, arts, both, of, prediction, or, prenotion, whereof, the, one, is, honoured, with, the, inquiry, of, aristotle, and, the, other, of, hippocrates, and, although, they, have, of, later, time, been, used, to, be, coupled, with, superstitions, and, fantastical, arts, yet, being, purged, and, restored, to, their, true, state, they, have, both, of, them, a, solid, ground, in, nature, and, a, profitable, use, in, life, the, first, is, physiognomy, which, discovereth, the, disposition, of, the, mind, by, the, lineaments, of, the, body, the, second, is, the, exposition, of, natural, dreams, which, discovereth, the, state, of, the, body, by, the, imaginations, of, the, mind, in, the, former, of, these, note, a, deficience, for, aristotle, hath, very, ingeniously, and, diligently, handled, the, factures, of, the, body, but, not, the, gestures, of, the, body, which, are, no, less, comprehensible, by, art, and, of, greater, use, and, advantage, for, the, lineaments, of, the, body, do, disclose, the, disposition, and, inclination, of, the, mind, in, general, but, the, motions, of, the, countenance, and, parts, do, not, only, so, but, do, further, disclose, the, present, humour, and, state, of, the, mind, and, will, for, as, your, majesty, saith, most, aptly, and, elegantly, “as, the, tongue, speaketh, to, the, ear, so, the, gesture, speaketh, to, the, eye, ”, and, therefore, a, number, of, subtle, persons, whose, eyes, do, dwell, upon, the, faces, and, fashions, of, men, do, well, know, the, advantage, of, this, observation, as, being, most, part, of, their, ability, neither, can, it, be, denied, but, that, it, is, a, great, discovery, of, dissimulations, and, a, great, direction, in, business, (3), the, latter, branch, touching, impression, hath, not, been, collected, into, art, but, hath, been, handled, dispersedly, and, it, hath, the, same, relation, or, _antistrophe_, that, the, former, hath, for, the, consideration, is, double—either, how, and, how, far, the, humours, and, affects, of, the, body, do, alter, or, work, upon, the, mind, or, again, how, and, how, far, the, passions, or, apprehensions, of, the, mind, do, alter, or, work, upon, the, body, the, former, of, these, hath, been, inquired, and, considered, as, a, part, and, appendix, of, medicine, but, much, more, as, a, part, of, religion, or, superstition, for, the, physician, prescribeth, cures, of, the, mind, in, frenzies, and, melancholy, passions, and, pretendeth, also, to, exhibit, medicines, to, exhilarate, the, mind, to, control, the, courage, to, clarify, the, wits, to, corroborate, the, memory, and, the, like, but, the, scruples, and, superstitions, of, diet, and, other, regiment, of, the, body, in, the, sect, of, the, pythagoreans, in, the, heresy, of, the, manichees, and, in, the, law, of, mahomet, do, exceed, so, likewise, the, ordinances, in, the, ceremonial, law, interdicting, the, eating, of, the, blood, and, the, fat, distinguishing, between, beasts, clean, and, unclean, for, meat, are, many, and, strict, nay, the, faith, itself, being, clear, and, serene, from, all, clouds, of, ceremony, yet, retaineth, the, use, of, fastlings, abstinences, and, other, macerations, and, humiliations, of, the, body, as, things, real, and, not, figurative, the, root, and, life, of, all, which, prescripts, is, (besides, the, ceremony), the, consideration, of, that, dependency, which, the, affections, of, the, mind, are, submitted, unto, upon, the, state, and, disposition, of, the, body, and, if, any, man, of, weak, judgment, do, conceive, that, this, suffering, of, the, mind, from, the, body, doth, either, question, the, immortality, or, derogate, from, the, sovereignty, of, the, soul, he, may, be, taught, in, easy, instances, that, the, infant, in, the, mother’s, womb, is, compatible, with, the, mother, and, yet, separable, and, the, most, absolute, monarch, is, sometimes, led, by, his, servants, and, yet, without, subjection, as, for, the, reciprocal, knowledge, which, is, the, operation, of, the, conceits, and, passions, of, the, mind, upon, the, body, we, see, all, wise, physicians, in, the, prescriptions, of, their, regiments, to, their, patients, do, ever, consider, _accidentia, animi_, as, of, great, force, to, further, or, hinder, remedies, or, recoveries, and, more, specially, it, is, an, inquiry, of, great, depth, and, worth, concerning, imagination, how, and, how, far, it, altereth, the, body, proper, of, the, imaginant, for, although, it, hath, a, manifest, power, to, hurt, it, followeth, not, it, hath, the, same, degree, of, power, to, help, no, more, than, a, man, can, conclude, that, because, there, be, pestilent, airs, able, suddenly, to, kill, a, man, in, health, therefore, there, should, be, sovereign, airs, able, suddenly, to, cure, a, man, in, sickness, but, the, inquisition, of, this, part, is, of, great, use, though, it, needeth, as, socrates, said, “a, delian, diver, ”, being, difficult, and, profound, but, unto, all, this, knowledge, _de, communi, vinculo_, of, the, concordances, between, the, mind, and, the, body, that, part, of, inquiry, is, most, necessary, which, considereth, of, the, seats, and, domiciles, which, the, several, faculties, of, the, mind, do, take, and, occupate, in, the, organs, of, the, body, which, knowledge, hath, been, attempted, and, is, controverted, and, deserveth, to, be, much, better, inquired, for, the, opinion, of, plato, who, placed, the, understanding, in, the, brain, animosity, (which, he, did, unfitly, call, anger, having, a, greater, mixture, with, pride), in, the, heart, and, concupiscence, or, sensuality, in, the, liver, deserveth, not, to, be, despised, but, much, less, to, be, allowed, so, then, we, have, constituted, (as, in, our, own, wish, and, advice), the, inquiry, touching, human, nature, entire, as, a, just, portion, of, knowledge, to, be, handled, apart, (1), the, knowledge, that, concerneth, man’s, body, is, divided, as, the, good, of, man’s, body, is, divided, unto, which, it, referreth, the, good, of, man’s, body, is, of, four, kinds—health, beauty, strength, and, pleasure, so, the, knowledges, are, medicine, or, art, of, cure, art, of, decoration, which, is, called, cosmetic, art, of, activity, which, is, called, athletic, and, art, voluptuary, which, tacitus, truly, calleth, _eruditus, luxus_, this, subject, of, man’s, body, is, of, all, other, things, in, nature, most, susceptible, of, remedy, but, then, that, remedy, is, most, susceptible, of, error, for, the, same, subtlety, of, the, subject, doth, cause, large, possibility, and, easy, failing, and, therefore, the, inquiry, ought, to, be, the, more, exact, (2), to, speak, therefore, of, medicine, and, to, resume, that, we, have, said, ascending, a, little, higher, the, ancient, opinion, that, man, was, _microcosmus_—an, abstract, or, model, of, the, world—hath, been, fantastically, strained, by, paracelsus, and, the, alchemists, as, if, there, were, to, be, found, in, man’s, body, certain, correspondences, and, parallels, which, should, have, respect, to, all, varieties, of, things, as, stars, planets, minerals, which, are, extant, in, the, great, world, but, thus, much, is, evidently, true, that, of, all, substances, which, nature, hath, produced, man’s, body, is, the, most, extremely, compounded, for, we, see, herbs, and, plants, are, nourished, by, earth, and, water, beasts, for, the, most, part, by, herbs, and, fruits, man, by, the, flesh, of, beasts, birds, fishes, herbs, grains, fruits, water, and, the, manifold, alterations, dressings, and, preparations, of, these, several, bodies, before, they, come, to, be, his, food, and, aliment, add, hereunto, that, beasts, have, a, more, simple, order, of, life, and, less, change, of, affections, to, work, upon, their, bodies, whereas, man, in, his, mansion, sleep, exercise, passions, hath, infinite, variations, and, it, cannot, be, denied, but, that, the, body, of, man, of, all, other, things, is, of, the, most, compounded, mass, the, soul, on, the, other, side, is, the, simplest, of, substances, as, is, well, expressed, “purumque, reliquit, æthereum, sensum, atque, auraï, simplicis, ignem, ”, so, that, it, is, no, marvel, though, the, soul, so, placed, enjoy, no, rest, if, that, principle, be, true, that, _motus, rerum, est, rapidus, extra, locum_, _placidus, in, loco_, but, to, the, purpose, this, variable, composition, of, man’s, body, hath, made, it, as, an, instrument, easy, to, distemper, and, therefore, the, poets, did, well, to, conjoin, music, and, medicine, in, apollo, because, the, office, of, medicine, is, but, to, tune, this, curious, harp, of, man’s, body, and, to, reduce, it, to, harmony, so, then, the, subject, being, so, variable, hath, made, the, art, by, consequent, more, conjectural, and, the, art, being, conjectural, hath, made, so, much, the, more, place, to, be, left, for, imposture, for, almost, all, other, arts, and, sciences, are, judged, by, acts, or, masterpieces, as, may, term, them, and, not, by, the, successes, and, events, the, lawyer, is, judged, by, the, virtue, of, his, pleading, and, not, by, the, issue, of, the, cause, this, master, in, this, ship, is, judged, by, the, directing, his, course, aright, and, not, by, the, fortune, of, the, voyage, but, the, physician, and, perhaps, this, politique, hath, no, particular, acts, demonstrative, of, his, ability, but, is, judged, most, by, the, event, which, is, ever, but, as, it, is, taken, for, who, can, tell, if, a, patient, die, or, recover, or, if, a, state, be, preserved, or, ruined, whether, it, be, art, or, accident, and, therefore, many, times, the, impostor, is, prized, and, the, man, of, virtue, taxed, nay, we, see, [the], weakness, and, credulity, of, men, is, such, as, they, will, often, refer, a, mountebank, or, witch, before, a, learned, physician, and, therefore, the, poets, were, clear-sighted, in, discerning, this, extreme, folly, when, they, made, æsculapius, and, circe, brother, and, sister, both, children, of, the, sun, as, in, the, verses—, “ipse, repertorem, medicinæ, talis, et, artis, fulmine, phœbigenam, stygias, detrusit, ad, undas, ”, and, again—, “dives, inaccessos, ubi, solis, filia, lucos, ”, &c, for, in, all, times, in, the, opinion, of, the, multitude, witches, and, old, women, and, impostors, have, had, a, competition, with, physicians, and, what, followeth, even, this, that, physicians, say, to, themselves, as, solomon, expresseth, it, upon, a, higher, occasion, “if, it, befall, to, me, as, befalleth, to, the, fools, why, should, labour, to, be, more, wise, ”, and, therefore, cannot, much, blame, physicians, that, they, use, commonly, to, intend, some, other, art, or, practice, which, they, fancy, more, than, their, profession, for, you, shall, have, of, them, antiquaries, poets, humanists, statesmen, merchants, divines, and, in, every, of, these, better, seen, than, in, their, profession, and, no, doubt, upon, this, ground, that, they, find, that, mediocrity, and, excellency, in, their, art, maketh, no, difference, in, profit, or, reputation, towards, their, fortune, for, the, weakness, of, patients, and, sweetness, of, life, and, nature, of, hope, maketh, men, depend, upon, physicians, with, all, their, defects, but, nevertheless, these, things, which, we, have, spoken, of, are, courses, begotten, between, a, little, occasion, and, a, great, deal, of, sloth, and, default, for, if, we, will, excite, and, awake, our, observation, we, shall, see, in, familiar, instances, what, a, predominant, faculty, the, subtlety, of, spirit, hath, over, the, variety, of, matter, or, form, nothing, more, variable, than, faces, and, countenances, yet, men, can, bear, in, memory, the, infinite, distinctions, of, them, nay, a, painter, with, a, few, shells, of, colours, and, the, benefit, of, his, eye, and, habit, of, his, imagination, can, imitate, them, all, that, ever, have, been, are, or, may, be, if, they, were, brought, before, him, nothing, more, variable, than, voices, yet, men, can, likewise, discern, them, personally, nay, you, shall, have, a, _buffon_, or, _pantomimus_, will, express, as, many, as, he, pleaseth, nothing, more, variable, than, the, differing, sounds, of, words, yet, men, have, found, the, way, to, reduce, them, to, a, few, simple, letters, so, that, it, is, not, the, insufficiency, or, incapacity, of, man’s, mind, but, it, is, the, remote, standing, or, placing, thereof, that, breedeth, these, mazes, and, incomprehensions, for, as, the, sense, afar, off, is, full, of, mistaking, but, is, exact, at, hand, so, is, it, of, the, understanding, the, remedy, whereof, is, not, to, quicken, or, strengthen, the, organ, but, to, go, nearer, to, the, object, and, therefore, there, is, no, doubt, but, if, the, physicians, will, learn, and, use, the, true, approaches, and, avenues, of, nature, they, may, assume, as, much, as, the, poet, saith, “et, quoniam, variant, morbi, variabimus, artes, mille, mali, species, mille, salutis, erunt, ”, which, that, they, should, do, the, nobleness, of, their, art, doth, deserve, well, shadowed, by, the, poets, in, that, they, made, æsculapius, to, be, the, son, of, [the], sun, the, one, being, the, fountain, of, life, the, other, as, the, second-stream, but, infinitely, more, honoured, by, the, example, of, our, saviour, who, made, the, body, of, man, the, object, of, his, miracles, as, the, soul, was, the, object, of, his, doctrine, for, we, read, not, that, ever, he, vouchsafed, to, do, any, miracle, about, honour, or, money, (except, that, one, for, giving, tribute, to, cæsar), but, only, about, the, preserving, sustaining, and, healing, the, body, of, man, (3), medicine, is, a, science, which, hath, been, (as, we, have, said), more, professed, than, laboured, and, yet, more, laboured, than, advanced, the, labour, having, been, in, my, judgment, rather, in, circle, than, in, progression, for, find, much, iteration, but, small, addition, it, considereth, causes, of, diseases, with, the, occasions, or, impulsions, the, diseases, themselves, with, the, accidents, and, the, cures, with, the, preservations, the, deficiences, which, think, good, to, note, being, a, few, of, many, and, those, such, as, are, of, a, more, open, and, manifest, nature, will, enumerate, and, not, place, (4), the, first, is, the, discontinuance, of, the, ancient, and, serious, diligence, of, hippocrates, which, used, to, set, down, a, narrative, of, the, special, cases, of, his, patients, and, how, they, proceeded, and, how, they, were, judged, by, recovery, or, death, therefore, having, an, example, proper, in, the, father, of, the, art, shall, not, need, to, allege, an, example, foreign, of, the, wisdom, of, the, lawyers, who, are, careful, to, report, new, cases, and, decisions, for, the, direction, of, future, judgments, this, continuance, of, medicinal, history, find, deficient, which, understand, neither, to, be, so, infinite, as, to, extend, to, every, common, case, nor, so, reserved, as, to, admit, none, but, wonders, for, many, things, are, new, in, this, manner, which, are, not, new, in, the, kind, and, if, men, will, intend, to, observe, they, shall, find, much, worthy, to, observe, (5), in, the, inquiry, which, is, made, by, anatomy, find, much, deficience, for, they, inquire, of, the, parts, and, their, substances, figures, and, collocations, but, they, inquire, not, of, the, diversities, of, the, parts, the, secrecies, of, the, passages, and, the, seats, or, nestling, of, the, humours, nor, much, of, the, footsteps, and, impressions, of, diseases, the, reason, of, which, omission, suppose, to, be, because, the, first, inquiry, may, be, satisfied, in, the, view, of, one, or, a, few, anatomies, but, the, latter, being, comparative, and, casual, must, arise, from, the, view, of, many, and, as, to, the, diversity, of, parts, there, is, no, doubt, but, the, facture, or, framing, of, the, inward, parts, is, as, full, of, difference, as, the, outward, and, in, that, is, the, cause, continent, of, many, diseases, which, not, being, observed, they, quarrel, many, times, with, the, humours, which, are, not, in, fault, the, fault, being, in, the, very, frame, and, mechanic, of, the, part, which, cannot, be, removed, by, medicine, alterative, but, must, be, accommodated, and, palliated, by, diets, and, medicines, familiar, and, for, the, passages, and, pores, it, is, true, which, was, anciently, noted, that, the, more, subtle, of, them, appear, not, in, anatomies, because, they, are, shut, and, latent, in, dead, bodies, though, they, be, open, and, manifest, in, life, which, being, supposed, though, the, inhumanity, of, _anatomia, vivorum_, was, by, celsus, justly, reproved, yet, in, regard, of, the, great, use, of, this, observation, the, inquiry, needed, not, by, him, so, slightly, to, have, been, relinquished, altogether, or, referred, to, the, casual, practices, of, surgery, but, might, have, been, well, diverted, upon, the, dissection, of, beasts, alive, which, notwithstanding, the, dissimilitude, of, their, parts, may, sufficiently, satisfy, this, inquiry, and, for, the, humours, they, are, commonly, passed, over, in, anatomies, as, purgaments, whereas, it, is, most, necessary, to, observe, what, cavities, nests, and, receptacles, the, humours, do, find, in, the, parts, with, the, differing, kind, of, the, humour, so, lodged, and, received, and, as, for, the, footsteps, of, diseases, and, their, devastations, of, the, inward, parts, impostumations, exulcerations, discontinuations, putrefactions, consumptions, contractions, extensions, convulsions, dislocations, obstructions, repletions, together, with, all, preternatural, substances, as, stones, carnosities, excrescences, worms, and, the, like, they, ought, to, have, been, exactly, observed, by, multitude, of, anatomies, and, the, contribution, of, men’s, several, experiences, and, carefully, set, down, both, historically, according, to, the, appearances, and, artificially, with, a, reference, to, the, diseases, and, symptoms, which, resulted, from, them, in, case, where, the, anatomy, is, of, a, defunct, patient, whereas, now, upon, opening, of, bodies, they, are, passed, over, slightly, and, in, silence, (6), in, the, inquiry, of, diseases, they, do, abandon, the, cures, of, many, some, as, in, their, nature, incurable, and, others, as, past, the, period, of, cure, so, that, sylla, and, the, triumvirs, never, proscribed, so, many, men, to, die, as, they, do, by, their, ignorant, edicts, whereof, numbers, do, escape, with, less, difficulty, than, they, did, in, the, roman, prescriptions, therefore, will, not, doubt, to, note, as, a, deficience, that, they, inquire, not, the, perfect, cures, of, many, diseases, or, extremities, of, diseases, but, pronouncing, them, incurable, do, enact, a, law, of, neglect, and, exempt, ignorance, from, discredit, (7), nay, further, esteem, it, the, office, of, a, physician, not, only, to, restore, health, but, to, mitigate, pain, and, dolors, and, not, only, when, such, mitigation, may, conduce, to, recovery, but, when, it, may, serve, to, make, a, fair, and, easy, passage, for, it, is, no, small, felicity, which, augustus, cæsar, was, wont, to, wish, to, himself, that, same, _euthanasia_, and, which, was, specially, noted, in, the, death, of, antoninus, pius, whose, death, was, after, the, fashion, and, semblance, of, a, kindly, and, pleasant, sheep, so, it, is, written, of, epicurus, that, after, his, disease, was, judged, desperate, he, drowned, his, stomach, and, senses, with, a, large, draught, and, ingurgitation, of, wine, whereupon, the, epigram, was, made, _hinc, stygias, ebrius, hausit, aquas_, he, was, not, sober, enough, to, taste, any, bitterness, of, the, stygian, water, but, the, physicians, contrariwise, do, make, a, kind, of, scruple, and, religion, to, stay, with, the, patient, after, the, disease, is, deplored, whereas, in, my, judgment, they, ought, both, to, inquire, the, skill, and, to, give, the, attendances, for, the, facilitating, and, assuaging, of, the, pains, and, agonies, of, death, (5), in, the, consideration, of, the, cures, of, diseases, find, a, deficience, in, the, receipts, of, propriety, respecting, the, particular, cures, of, diseases, for, the, physicians, have, frustrated, the, fruit, of, tradition, and, experience, by, their, magistralities, in, adding, and, taking, out, and, changing, _quid, pro, qua_, in, their, receipts, at, their, pleasures, commanding, so, over, the, medicine, as, the, medicine, cannot, command, over, the, disease, for, except, it, be, treacle, and, _mithridatum_, and, of, late, _diascordium_, and, a, few, more, they, tie, themselves, to, no, receipts, severely, and, religiously, for, as, to, the, confections, of, sale, which, are, in, the, shops, they, are, for, readiness, and, not, for, propriety, for, they, are, upon, general, intentions, of, purging, opening, comforting, altering, and, not, much, appropriate, to, particular, diseases, and, this, is, the, cause, why, empirics, and, old, women, are, more, happy, many, times, in, their, cures, than, learned, physicians, because, they, are, more, religious, in, holding, their, medicines, therefore, here, is, the, deficience, which, find, that, physicians, have, not, partly, out, of, their, own, practice, partly, out, of, the, constant, probations, reported, in, books, and, partly, out, of, the, traditions, of, empirics, set, down, and, delivered, over, certain, experimental, medicines, for, the, cure, of, particular, diseases, besides, their, own, conjectural, and, magistral, descriptions, for, as, they, were, the, men, of, the, best, composition, in, the, state, of, rome, which, either, being, consuls, inclined, to, the, people, or, being, tribunes, inclined, to, the, senate, so, in, the, matter, we, now, handle, they, be, the, best, physicians, which, being, learned, incline, to, the, traditions, of, experience, or, being, empirics, incline, to, the, methods, of, learning, (9), in, preparation, of, medicines, do, find, strange, specially, considering, how, mineral, medicines, have, been, extolled, and, that, they, are, safer, for, the, outward, than, inward, parts, that, no, man, hath, sought, to, make, an, imitation, by, art, of, natural, baths, and, medicinable, fountains, which, nevertheless, are, confessed, to, receive, their, virtues, from, minerals, and, not, so, only, but, discerned, and, distinguished, from, what, particular, mineral, they, receive, tincture, as, sulphur, vitriol, steel, or, the, like, which, nature, if, it, may, be, reduced, to, compositions, of, art, both, the, variety, of, them, will, be, increased, and, the, temper, of, them, will, be, more, commanded, (10), but, lest, grow, to, be, more, particular, than, is, agreeable, either, to, my, intention, or, to, proportion, will, conclude, this, part, with, the, note, of, one, deficience, more, which, seemeth, to, me, of, greatest, consequence, which, is, that, the, prescripts, in, use, are, too, compendious, to, attain, their, end, for, to, my, understanding, it, is, a, vain, and, flattering, opinion, to, think, any, medicine, can, be, so, sovereign, or, so, happy, as, that, the, receipt, or, miss, of, it, can, work, any, great, effect, upon, the, body, of, man, it, were, a, strange, speech, which, spoken, or, spoken, oft, should, reclaim, a, man, from, a, vice, to, which, he, were, by, nature, subject, it, is, order, pursuit, sequence, and, interchange, of, application, which, is, mighty, in, nature, which, although, it, require, more, exact, knowledge, in, prescribing, and, more, precise, obedience, in, observing, yet, is, recompensed, with, the, magnitude, of, effects, and, although, a, man, would, think, by, the, daily, visitations, of, the, physicians, that, there, were, a, pursuance, in, the, cure, yet, let, a, man, look, into, their, prescripts, and, ministrations, and, he, shall, find, them, but, inconstancies, and, every, day’s, devices, without, any, settled, providence, or, project, not, that, every, scrupulous, or, superstitious, prescript, is, effectual, no, more, than, every, straight, way, is, the, way, to, heaven, but, the, truth, of, the, direction, must, precede, severity, of, observance, (11), for, cosmetic, it, hath, parts, civil, and, parts, effeminate, for, cleanness, of, body, was, ever, esteemed, to, proceed, from, a, due, reverence, to, god, to, society, and, to, ourselves, as, for, artificial, decoration, it, is, well, worthy, of, the, deficiences, which, it, hath, being, neither, fine, enough, to, deceive, nor, handsome, to, use, nor, wholesome, to, please, (12), for, athletic, take, the, subject, of, it, largely, that, is, to, say, for, any, point, of, ability, whereunto, the, body, of, man, may, be, brought, whether, it, be, of, activity, or, of, patience, whereof, activity, hath, two, parts, strength, and, swiftness, and, patience, likewise, hath, two, parts, hardness, against, wants, and, extremities, and, endurance, of, pain, or, torment, whereof, we, see, the, practices, in, tumblers, in, savages, and, in, those, that, suffer, punishment, nay, if, there, be, any, other, faculty, which, falls, not, within, any, of, the, former, divisions, as, in, those, that, dive, that, obtain, a, strange, power, of, containing, respiration, and, the, like, refer, it, to, this, part, of, these, things, the, practices, are, known, but, the, philosophy, that, concerneth, them, is, not, much, inquired, the, rather, think, because, they, are, supposed, to, be, obtained, either, by, an, aptness, of, nature, which, cannot, be, taught, or, only, by, continual, custom, which, is, soon, prescribed, which, though, it, be, not, true, yet, forbear, to, note, any, deficiences, for, the, olympian, games, are, down, long, since, and, the, mediocrity, of, these, things, is, for, use, as, for, the, excellency, of, them, it, serveth, for, the, most, part, but, for, mercenary, ostentation, (13), for, arts, of, pleasure, sensual, the, chief, deficience, in, them, is, of, laws, to, repress, them, for, as, it, hath, been, well, observed, that, the, arts, which, flourish, in, times, while, virtue, is, in, growth, are, military, and, while, virtue, is, in, state, are, liberal, and, while, virtue, is, in, declination, are, voluptuary, so, doubt, that, this, age, of, the, world, is, somewhat, upon, the, descent, of, the, wheel, with, arts, voluptuary, couple, practices, joculary, for, the, deceiving, of, the, senses, is, one, of, the, pleasures, of, the, senses, as, for, games, of, recreation, hold, them, to, belong, to, civil, life, and, education, and, thus, much, of, that, particular, human, philosophy, which, concerns, the, body, which, is, but, the, tabernacle, of, the, mind, (1), for, human, knowledge, which, concerns, the, mind, it, hath, two, parts, the, one, that, inquireth, of, the, substance, or, nature, of, the, soul, or, mind, the, other, that, inquireth, of, the, faculties, or, functions, thereof, unto, the, first, of, these, the, considerations, of, the, original, of, the, soul, whether, it, be, native, or, adventive, and, how, far, it, is, exempted, from, laws, of, matter, and, of, the, immortality, thereof, and, many, other, points, do, appertain, which, have, been, not, more, laboriously, inquired, than, variously, reported, so, as, the, travail, therein, taken, seemeth, to, have, been, rather, in, a, maze, than, in, a, way, but, although, am, of, opinion, that, this, knowledge, may, be, more, really, and, soundly, inquired, even, in, nature, than, it, hath, been, yet, hold, that, in, the, end, it, must, be, hounded, by, religion, or, else, it, will, be, subject, to, deceit, and, delusion, for, as, the, substance, of, the, soul, in, the, creation, was, not, extracted, out, of, the, mass, of, heaven, and, earth, by, the, benediction, of, a, _producat_, but, was, immediately, inspired, from, god, so, it, is, not, possible, that, it, should, be, (otherwise, than, by, accident), subject, to, the, laws, of, heaven, and, earth, which, are, the, subject, of, philosophy, and, therefore, the, true, knowledge, of, the, nature, and, state, of, the, soul, must, come, by, the, same, inspiration, that, gave, the, substance, unto, this, part, of, knowledge, touching, the, soul, there, be, two, appendices, which, as, they, have, been, handled, have, rather, vapoured, forth, fables, than, kindled, truth, divination, and, fascination, (2), divination, hath, been, anciently, and, fitly, divided, into, artificial, and, natural, whereof, artificial, is, when, the, mind, maketh, a, prediction, by, argument, concluding, upon, signs, and, tokens, natural, is, when, the, mind, hath, a, presention, by, an, internal, power, without, the, inducement, of, a, sign, artificial, is, of, two, sorts, either, when, the, argument, is, coupled, with, a, derivation, of, causes, which, is, rational, or, when, it, is, only, grounded, upon, a, coincidence, of, the, effect, which, is, experimental, whereof, the, latter, for, the, most, part, is, superstitious, such, as, were, the, heathen, observations, upon, the, inspection, of, sacrifices, the, flights, of, birds, the, swarming, of, bees, and, such, as, was, the, chaldean, astrology, and, the, like, for, artificial, divination, the, several, kinds, thereof, are, distributed, amongst, particular, knowledges, the, astronomer, hath, his, predictions, as, of, conjunctions, aspects, eclipses, and, the, like, the, physician, hath, his, predictions, of, death, of, recovery, of, the, accidents, and, issues, of, diseases, the, politique, hath, his, predictions, urbem, venalem_, _et, cito, perituram_, _si, emptorem, invenerit_, which, stayed, not, long, to, be, performed, in, sylla, first, and, after, in, cæsar, so, as, these, predictions, are, now, impertinent, and, to, be, referred, over, but, the, divination, which, springeth, from, the, internal, nature, of, the, soul, is, that, which, we, now, speak, of, which, hath, been, made, to, be, of, two, sorts, primitive, and, by, influxion, primitive, is, grounded, upon, the, supposition, that, the, mind, when, it, is, withdrawn, and, collected, into, itself, and, not, diffused, into, the, organs, of, the, body, hath, some, extent, and, latitude, of, prenotion, which, therefore, appeareth, most, in, sleep, in, ecstasies, and, near, death, and, more, rarely, in, waking, apprehensions, and, is, induced, and, furthered, by, those, abstinences, and, observances, which, make, the, mind, most, to, consist, in, itself, by, influxion, is, grounded, upon, the, conceit, that, the, mind, as, a, mirror, or, glass, should, take, illumination, from, the, foreknowledge, of, god, and, spirits, unto, which, the, same, regiment, doth, likewise, conduce, for, the, retiring, of, the, mind, within, itself, is, the, state, which, is, most, susceptible, of, divine, influxions, save, that, it, is, accompanied, in, this, case, with, a, fervency, and, elevation, (which, the, ancients, noted, by, fury), and, not, with, a, repose, and, quiet, as, it, is, in, the, other, (3), fascination, is, the, power, and, act, of, imagination, intensive, upon, other, bodies, than, the, body, of, the, imaginant, for, of, that, we, spake, in, the, proper, place, wherein, the, school, of, paracelsus, and, the, disciples, of, pretended, natural, magic, have, been, so, intemperate, as, they, have, exalted, the, power, of, the, imagination, to, be, much, one, with, the, power, of, miracle-working, faith, others, that, draw, nearer, to, probability, calling, to, their, view, the, secret, passages, of, things, and, specially, of, the, contagion, that, passeth, from, body, to, body, do, conceive, it, should, likewise, be, agreeable, to, nature, that, there, should, be, some, transmissions, and, operations, from, spirit, to, spirit, without, the, mediation, of, the, senses, whence, the, conceits, have, grown, (now, almost, made, civil), of, the, mastering, spirit, and, the, force, of, confidence, and, the, like, incident, unto, this, is, the, inquiry, how, to, raise, and, fortify, the, imagination, for, if, the, imagination, fortified, have, power, then, it, is, material, to, know, how, to, fortify, and, exalt, it, and, herein, comes, in, crookedly, and, dangerously, a, palliation, of, a, great, part, of, ceremonial, magic, for, it, may, be, pretended, that, ceremonies, characters, and, charms, do, work, not, by, any, tacit, or, sacramental, contract, with, evil, spirits, but, serve, only, to, strengthen, the, imagination, of, him, that, useth, it, as, images, are, said, by, the, roman, church, to, fix, the, cogitations, and, raise, the, devotions, of, them, that, pray, before, them, but, for, mine, own, judgment, if, it, be, admitted, that, imagination, hath, power, and, that, ceremonies, fortify, imagination, and, that, they, be, used, sincerely, and, intentionally, for, that, purpose, yet, should, hold, them, unlawful, as, opposing, to, that, first, edict, which, god, gave, unto, man, _in, sudore, vultus, comedes, panem, tuum_, for, they, propound, those, noble, effects, which, god, hath, set, forth, unto, man, to, be, bought, at, the, price, of, labour, to, be, attained, by, a, few, easy, and, slothful, observances, deficiences, in, these, knowledges, will, report, none, other, than, the, general, deficience, that, it, is, not, known, how, much, of, them, is, verity, and, how, much, vanity, (1), the, knowledge, which, respecteth, the, faculties, of, the, mind, of, man, is, of, two, kinds—the, one, respecting, his, understanding, and, reason, and, the, other, his, will, appetite, and, affection, whereof, the, former, produceth, position, or, decree, the, latter, action, or, execution, it, is, true, that, the, imagination, is, an, agent, or, _nuncius_, in, both, provinces, both, the, judicial, and, the, ministerial, for, sense, sendeth, over, to, imagination, before, reason, have, judged, and, reason, sendeth, over, to, imagination, before, the, decree, can, be, acted, for, imagination, ever, precedeth, voluntary, motion, saving, that, this, janus, of, imagination, hath, differing, faces, for, the, face, towards, reason, hath, the, print, of, truth, but, the, face, towards, action, hath, the, print, of, good, which, nevertheless, are, faces, “quales, decet, esse, sororum, ”, neither, is, the, imagination, simply, and, only, a, messenger, but, is, invested, with, or, at, least, wise, usurpeth, no, small, authority, in, itself, besides, the, duty, of, the, message, for, it, was, well, said, by, aristotle, “that, the, mind, hath, over, the, body, that, commandment, which, the, lord, hath, over, a, bondman, but, that, reason, hath, over, the, imagination, that, commandment, which, a, magistrate, hath, over, a, free, citizen, ”, who, may, come, also, to, rule, in, his, turn, for, we, see, that, in, matters, of, faith, and, religion, we, raise, our, imagination, above, our, reason, which, is, the, cause, why, religion, sought, ever, access, to, the, mind, by, similitudes, types, parables, visions, dreams, and, again, in, all, persuasions, that, are, wrought, by, eloquence, and, other, impressions, of, like, nature, which, do, paint, and, disguise, the, true, appearance, of, things, the, chief, recommendation, unto, reason, is, from, the, imagination, nevertheless, because, find, not, any, science, that, doth, properly, or, fitly, pertain, to, the, imagination, see, no, cause, to, alter, the, former, division, for, as, for, poesy, it, is, rather, a, pleasure, or, play, of, imagination, than, a, work, or, duty, thereof, and, if, it, be, a, work, we, speak, not, now, of, such, parts, of, learning, as, the, imagination, produceth, but, of, such, sciences, as, handle, and, consider, of, the, imagination, no, more, than, we, shall, speak, now, of, such, knowledges, as, reason, produceth, (for, that, extendeth, to, all, philosophy), but, of, such, knowledges, as, do, handle, and, inquire, of, the, faculty, of, reason, so, as, poesy, had, his, true, place, as, for, the, power, of, the, imagination, in, nature, and, the, manner, of, fortifying, the, same, we, have, mentioned, it, in, the, doctrine, _de, anima_, whereunto, most, fitly, it, belongeth, and, lastly, for, imaginative, or, insinuative, reason, which, is, the, subject, of, rhetoric, we, think, it, best, to, refer, it, to, the, arts, of, reason, so, therefore, we, content, ourselves, with, the, former, division, that, human, philosophy, which, respecteth, the, faculties, of, the, mind, of, man, hath, two, parts, rational, and, moral, (2), the, part, of, human, philosophy, which, is, rational, is, of, all, knowledges, to, the, most, wits, the, least, delightful, and, seemeth, but, a, net, of, subtlety, and, spinosity, for, as, it, was, truly, said, that, knowledge, is, _pabulum, animi_, so, in, the, nature, of, men’s, appetite, to, this, food, most, men, are, of, the, taste, and, stomach, of, the, israelites, in, the, desert, that, would, fain, have, returned, _ad, ollas, carnium_, and, were, weary, of, manna, which, though, it, were, celestial, yet, seemed, less, nutritive, and, comfortable, so, generally, men, taste, well, knowledges, that, are, drenched, in, flesh, and, blood, civil, history, morality, policy, about, the, which, men’s, affections, praises, fortunes, do, turn, and, are, conversant, but, this, same, _lumen, siccum_, doth, parch, and, offend, most, men’s, watery, and, soft, natures, but, to, speak, truly, of, things, as, they, are, in, worth, rational, knowledges, are, the, keys, of, all, other, arts, for, as, aristotle, saith, aptly, and, elegantly, “that, the, hand, is, the, instrument, of, instruments, and, the, mind, is, the, form, of, forms, ”, so, these, be, truly, said, to, be, the, art, of, arts, neither, do, they, only, direct, but, likewise, confirm, and, strengthen, even, as, the, habit, of, shooting, doth, not, only, enable, to, shoot, a, nearer, shoot, but, also, to, draw, a, stronger, bow, (3), the, arts, intellectual, are, four, in, number, divided, according, to, the, ends, whereunto, they, are, referred—for, man’s, labour, is, to, invent, that, which, is, sought, or, propounded, or, to, judge, that, which, is, invented, or, to, retain, that, which, is, judged, or, to, deliver, over, that, which, is, retained, so, as, the, arts, must, be, four—art, of, inquiry, or, invention, art, of, examination, or, judgment, art, of, custody, or, memory, and, art, of, elocution, or, tradition, (1), invention, is, of, two, kinds, much, differing—the, one, of, arts, and, sciences, and, the, other, of, speech, and, arguments, the, former, of, these, do, report, deficient, which, seemeth, to, me, to, be, such, a, deficience, as, if, in, the, making, of, an, inventory, touching, the, state, of, a, defunct, it, should, be, set, down, that, there, is, no, ready, money, for, as, money, will, fetch, all, other, commodities, so, this, knowledge, is, that, which, should, purchase, all, the, rest, and, like, as, the, west, indies, had, never, been, discovered, if, the, use, of, the, mariner’s, needle, had, not, been, first, discovered, though, the, one, be, vast, regions, and, the, other, a, small, motion, so, it, cannot, be, found, strange, if, sciences, be, no, further, discovered, if, the, art, itself, of, invention, and, discovery, hath, been, passed, over, (2), that, this, part, of, knowledge, is, wanting, to, my, judgment, standeth, plainly, confessed, for, first, logic, doth, not, pretend, to, invent, sciences, or, the, axioms, of, sciences, but, passeth, it, over, with, a, _cuique, in, sua, arte, credendum_, and, celsus, acknowledgeth, it, gravely, speaking, of, the, empirical, and, dogmatical, sects, of, physicians, “that, medicines, and, cures, were, first, found, out, and, then, after, the, reasons, and, causes, were, discoursed, and, not, the, causes, first, found, out, and, by, light, from, them, the, medicines, and, cures, discovered, ”, and, plato, in, his, “theætetus”, noteth, well, “that, particulars, are, infinite, and, the, higher, generalities, give, no, sufficient, direction, and, that, the, pith, of, all, sciences, which, maketh, the, artsman, differ, from, the, inexpert, is, in, the, middle, propositions, which, in, every, particular, knowledge, are, taken, from, tradition, and, experience, ”, and, therefore, we, see, that, they, which, discourse, of, the, inventions, and, originals, of, things, refer, them, rather, to, chance, than, to, art, and, rather, to, beasts, birds, fishes, serpents, than, to, men, “dictamnum, genetrix, cretæa, carpit, ab, ida, puberibus, caulem, foliis, et, flore, camantem, purpureo, non, illa, feris, incognita, capris, gramina, cum, tergo, volucres, hæsere, sagittæ, ”, so, that, it, was, no, marvel, (the, manner, of, antiquity, being, to, consecrate, inventors), that, the, egyptians, had, so, few, human, idols, in, their, temples, but, almost, all, brute, “omnigenumque, deum, monstra, et, latrator, anubis, contra, neptunum, et, venerem, contraque, minervam, &c, ”, and, if, you, like, better, the, tradition, of, the, grecians, and, ascribe, the, first, inventions, to, men, yet, you, will, rather, believe, that, prometheus, first, stroke, the, flints, and, marvelled, at, the, spark, than, that, when, he, first, stroke, the, flints, he, expected, the, spark, and, therefore, we, see, the, west, indian, prometheus, had, no, intelligence, with, the, european, because, of, the, rareness, with, them, of, flint, that, gave, the, first, occasion, so, as, it, should, seem, that, hitherto, men, are, rather, beholden, to, a, wild, goat, for, surgery, or, to, a, nightingale, for, music, or, to, the, ibis, for, some, part, of, physic, or, to, the, pot-lid, that, flew, open, for, artillery, or, generally, to, chance, or, anything, else, than, to, logic, for, the, invention, of, arts, and, sciences, neither, is, the, form, of, invention, which, virgil, describeth, much, other, “ut, varias, usus, meditande, extunderet, artes, paulatim, ”, for, if, you, observe, the, words, well, it, is, no, other, method, than, that, which, brute, beasts, are, capable, of, and, do, put, in, ure, which, is, a, perpetual, intending, or, practising, some, one, thing, urged, and, imposed, by, an, absolute, necessity, of, conservation, of, being, for, so, cicero, saith, very, truly, _usus, uni, rei, deditus, et, naturam, et, artem, sæpe, vincit_, and, therefore, if, it, be, said, of, men, “labor, omnia, vincit, improbus, et, duris, urgens, in, rebus, egestas, ”, it, is, likewise, said, of, beasts, _quis, psittaco, docuit, suum, χαιρε_, who, taught, the, raven, in, a, drought, to, throw, pebbles, into, a, hollow, tree, where, she, spied, water, that, the, water, might, rise, so, as, she, might, come, to, it, who, taught, the, bee, to, sail, through, such, a, vast, sea, or, air, and, to, find, the, way, from, a, field, in, a, flower, a, great, way, off, to, her, hive, who, taught, the, ant, to, bite, every, grain, of, corn, that, she, burieth, in, her, hill, lest, it, should, take, root, and, grow, add, then, the, word, _extundere_, which, importeth, the, extreme, difficulty, and, the, word, _paulatim_, which, importeth, the, extreme, slowness, and, we, are, where, we, were, even, amongst, the, egyptians’, gods, there, being, little, left, to, the, faculty, of, reason, and, nothing, to, the, duty, or, art, for, matter, of, invention, (3), secondly, the, induction, which, the, logicians, speak, of, and, which, seemeth, familiar, with, plato, whereby, the, principles, of, sciences, may, be, pretended, to, be, invented, and, so, the, middle, propositions, by, derivation, from, the, principles, their, form, of, induction, say, is, utterly, vicious, and, incompetent, wherein, their, error, is, the, fouler, because, it, is, the, duty, of, art, to, perfect, and, exalt, nature, but, they, contrariwise, have, wronged, abused, and, traduced, nature, for, he, that, shall, attentively, observe, how, the, mind, doth, gather, this, excellent, dew, of, knowledge, like, unto, that, which, the, poet, speaketh, of, _aërei, mellis, cælestia, dona_, distilling, and, contriving, it, out, of, particulars, natural, and, artificial, as, the, flowers, of, the, field, and, garden, shall, find, that, the, mind, of, herself, by, nature, doth, manage, and, act, an, induction, much, better, than, they, describe, it, for, to, conclude, upon, an, enumeration, of, particulars, without, instance, contradictory, is, no, conclusion, but, a, conjecture, for, who, can, assure, (in, many, subjects), upon, those, particulars, which, appear, of, a, side, that, there, are, not, other, on, the, contrary, side, which, appear, not, as, if, samuel, should, have, rested, upon, those, sons, of, jesse, which, were, brought, before, him, and, failed, of, david, which, was, in, the, field, and, this, form, (to, say, truth), is, so, gross, as, it, had, not, been, possible, for, wits, so, subtle, as, have, managed, these, things, to, have, offered, it, to, the, world, but, that, they, hasted, to, their, theories, and, dogmaticals, and, were, imperious, and, scornful, toward, particulars, which, their, manner, was, to, use, but, as, _lictores_, and, _viatores_, for, sergeants, and, whifflers, _ad, summovendam, turbam_, to, make, way, and, make, room, for, their, opinions, rather, than, in, their, true, use, and, service, certainly, it, is, a, thing, may, touch, a, man, with, a, religious, wonder, to, see, how, the, footsteps, of, seducement, are, the, very, same, in, divine, and, human, truth, for, as, in, divine, truth, man, cannot, endure, to, become, as, a, child, so, in, human, they, reputed, the, attending, the, inductions, (whereof, we, speak), as, if, it, were, a, second, infancy, or, childhood, (4), thirdly, allow, some, principles, or, axioms, were, rightly, induced, yet, nevertheless, certain, it, is, that, middle, propositions, cannot, be, deduced, from, them, in, subject, of, nature, by, syllogism—that, is, by, touch, and, reduction, of, them, to, principles, in, a, middle, term, it, is, true, that, in, sciences, popular, as, moralities, laws, and, the, like, yea, and, divinity, (because, it, pleaseth, god, to, apply, himself, to, the, capacity, of, the, simplest), that, form, may, have, use, and, in, natural, philosophy, likewise, by, way, of, argument, or, satisfactory, reason, _quæ, assensum, parit, operis, effæta, est_, but, the, subtlety, of, nature, and, operations, will, not, be, enchained, in, those, bonds, for, arguments, consist, of, propositions, and, propositions, of, words, and, words, are, but, the, current, tokens, or, marks, of, popular, notions, of, things, which, notions, if, they, be, grossly, and, variably, collected, out, of, particulars, it, is, not, the, laborious, examination, either, of, consequences, of, arguments, or, of, the, truth, of, propositions, that, can, ever, correct, that, error, being, (as, the, physicians, speak), in, the, first, digestion, and, therefore, it, was, not, without, cause, that, so, many, excellent, philosophers, became, sceptics, and, academics, and, denied, any, certainty, of, knowledge, or, comprehension, and, held, opinion, that, the, knowledge, of, man, extended, only, to, appearances, and, probabilities, it, is, true, that, in, socrates, it, was, supposed, to, be, but, a, form, of, irony, _scientiam, dissimulando, simulavit_, for, he, used, to, disable, his, knowledge, to, the, end, to, enhance, his, knowledge, like, the, humour, of, tiberius, in, his, beginnings, that, would, reign, but, would, not, acknowledge, so, much, and, in, the, later, academy, which, cicero, embraced, this, opinion, also, of, _acatalepsia_, doubt), was, not, held, sincerely, for, that, all, those, which, excelled, in, copy, of, speech, seem, to, have, chosen, that, sect, as, that, which, was, fittest, to, give, glory, to, their, eloquence, and, variable, discourses, being, rather, like, progresses, of, pleasure, than, journeys, to, an, end, but, assuredly, many, scattered, in, both, academies, did, hold, it, in, subtlety, and, integrity, but, here, was, their, chief, error, they, charged, the, deceit, upon, the, senses, which, in, my, judgment, (notwithstanding, all, their, cavillations), are, very, sufficient, to, certify, and, report, truth, though, not, always, immediately, yet, by, comparison, by, help, of, instrument, and, by, producing, and, urging, such, things, as, are, too, subtle, for, the, sense, to, some, effect, comprehensible, by, the, sense, and, other, like, assistance, but, they, ought, to, have, charged, the, deceit, upon, the, weakness, of, the, intellectual, powers, and, upon, the, manner, of, collecting, and, concluding, upon, the, reports, of, the, senses, this, speak, not, to, disable, the, mind, of, man, but, to, stir, it, up, to, seek, help, for, no, man, be, he, never, so, cunning, or, practised, can, make, a, straight, line, or, perfect, circle, by, steadiness, of, hand, which, may, be, easily, done, by, help, of, a, ruler, or, compass, (5), this, part, of, invention, concerning, the, invention, of, sciences, purpose, (if, god, give, me, leave), hereafter, to, propound, having, digested, it, into, two, parts, whereof, the, one, term, _experientia, literata_, and, the, other, _interpretatio, naturæ_, the, former, being, but, a, degree, and, rudiment, of, the, latter, but, will, not, dwell, too, long, nor, speak, too, great, upon, a, promise, (6), the, invention, of, speech, or, argument, is, not, properly, an, invention, for, to, invent, is, to, discover, that, we, know, not, and, not, to, recover, or, resummon, that, which, we, already, know, and, the, use, of, this, invention, is, no, other, but, out, of, the, knowledge, whereof, our, mind, is, already, possessed, to, draw, forth, or, call, before, us, that, which, may, be, pertinent, to, the, purpose, which, we, take, into, our, consideration, so, as, to, speak, truly, it, is, no, invention, but, a, remembrance, or, suggestion, with, an, application, which, is, the, cause, why, the, schools, do, place, it, after, judgment, as, subsequent, and, not, precedent, nevertheless, because, we, do, account, it, a, chase, as, well, of, deer, in, an, enclosed, park, as, in, a, forest, at, large, and, that, it, hath, already, obtained, the, name, let, it, be, called, invention, so, as, it, be, perceived, and, discerned, that, the, scope, and, end, of, this, invention, is, readiness, and, present, use, of, our, knowledge, and, not, addition, or, amplification, thereof, (7), to, procure, this, ready, use, of, knowledge, there, are, two, courses, preparation, and, suggestion, the, former, of, these, seemeth, scarcely, a, part, of, knowledge, consisting, rather, of, diligence, than, of, any, artificial, erudition, and, herein, aristotle, wittily, but, hurtfully, doth, deride, the, sophists, near, his, time, saying, “they, did, as, if, one, that, professed, the, art, of, shoemaking, should, not, teach, how, to, make, up, a, shoe, but, only, exhibit, in, a, readiness, a, number, of, shoes, of, all, fashions, and, sizes, ”, but, yet, a, man, might, reply, that, if, a, shoemaker, should, have, no, shoes, in, his, shop, but, only, work, as, he, is, bespoken, he, should, be, weakly, customed, but, our, saviour, speaking, of, divine, knowledge, saith, “that, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, like, a, good, householder, that, bringeth, forth, both, new, and, old, store, ”, and, we, see, the, ancient, writers, of, rhetoric, do, give, it, in, precept, that, pleaders, should, have, the, places, whereof, they, have, most, continual, use, ready, handled, in, all, the, variety, that, may, be, as, that, to, speak, for, the, literal, interpretation, of, the, law, against, equity, and, contrary, and, to, speak, for, presumptions, and, inferences, against, testimony, and, contrary, and, cicero, himself, being, broken, unto, it, by, great, experience, delivereth, it, plainly, that, whatsoever, a, man, shall, have, occasion, to, speak, of, (if, he, will, take, the, pains), he, may, have, it, in, effect, premeditate, and, handled, _in, thesi_, so, that, when, he, cometh, to, a, particular, he, shall, have, nothing, to, do, but, to, put, to, names, and, times, and, places, and, such, other, circumstances, of, individuals, we, see, likewise, the, exact, diligence, of, demosthenes, who, in, regard, of, the, great, force, that, the, entrance, and, access, into, causes, hath, to, make, a, good, impression, had, ready, framed, a, number, of, prefaces, for, orations, and, speeches, all, which, authorities, and, precedents, may, overweigh, aristotle’s, opinion, that, would, have, us, change, a, rich, wardrobe, for, a, pair, of, shears, (8), but, the, nature, of, the, collection, of, this, provision, or, preparatory, store, though, it, be, common, both, to, logic, and, rhetoric, yet, having, made, an, entry, of, it, here, where, it, came, first, to, be, spoken, of, think, fit, to, refer, over, the, further, handling, of, it, to, rhetoric, (9), the, other, part, of, invention, which, term, suggestion, doth, assign, and, direct, us, to, certain, marks, or, places, which, may, excite, our, mind, to, return, and, produce, such, knowledge, as, it, hath, formerly, collected, to, the, end, we, may, make, use, thereof, neither, is, this, use, (truly, taken), only, to, furnish, argument, to, dispute, probably, with, others, but, likewise, to, minister, unto, our, judgment, to, conclude, aright, within, ourselves, neither, may, these, places, serve, only, to, apprompt, our, invention, but, also, to, direct, our, inquiry, for, a, faculty, of, wise, interrogating, is, half, a, knowledge, for, as, plato, saith, “whosoever, seeketh, knoweth, that, which, he, seeketh, for, in, a, general, notion, else, how, shall, he, know, it, when, he, hath, found, it, ”, and, therefore, the, larger, your, anticipation, is, the, more, direct, and, compendious, is, your, search, but, the, same, places, which, will, help, us, what, to, produce, of, that, which, we, know, already, will, also, help, us, if, a, man, of, experience, were, before, us, what, questions, to, ask, or, if, we, have, books, and, authors, to, instruct, us, what, points, to, search, and, revolve, so, as, cannot, report, that, this, part, of, invention, which, is, that, which, the, schools, call, topics, is, deficient, (10), nevertheless, topics, are, of, two, sorts, general, and, special, the, general, we, have, spoken, to, but, the, particular, hath, been, touched, by, some, but, rejected, generally, as, inartificial, and, variable, but, leaving, the, humour, which, hath, reigned, too, much, in, the, schools, (which, is, to, be, vainly, subtle, in, a, few, things, which, are, within, their, command, and, to, reject, the, rest), do, receive, particular, topics, that, is, places, or, directions, of, invention, and, inquiry, in, every, particular, knowledge, as, things, of, great, use, being, mixtures, of, logic, with, the, matter, of, sciences, for, in, these, it, holdeth, _ars, inveniendi, adolescit, cum, inventis_, for, as, in, going, of, a, way, we, do, not, only, gain, that, part, of, the, way, which, is, passed, but, we, gain, the, better, sight, of, that, part, of, the, way, which, remaineth, so, every, degree, of, proceeding, in, a, science, giveth, a, light, to, that, which, followeth, which, light, if, we, strengthen, by, drawing, it, forth, into, questions, or, places, of, inquiry, we, do, greatly, advance, our, pursuit, (1), now, we, pass, unto, the, arts, of, judgment, which, handle, the, natures, of, proofs, and, demonstrations, which, as, to, induction, hath, a, coincidence, with, invention, for, all, inductions, whether, in, good, or, vicious, form, the, same, action, of, the, mind, which, inventeth, judgeth—all, one, as, in, the, sense, but, otherwise, it, is, in, proof, by, syllogism, for, the, proof, being, not, immediate, but, by, mean, the, invention, of, the, mean, is, one, thing, and, the, judgment, of, the, consequence, is, another, the, one, exciting, only, the, other, examining, therefore, for, the, real, and, exact, form, of, judgment, we, refer, ourselves, to, that, which, we, have, spoken, of, interpretation, of, nature, (2), for, the, other, judgment, by, syllogism, as, it, is, a, thing, most, agreeable, to, the, mind, of, man, so, it, hath, been, vehemently, end, excellently, laboured, for, the, nature, of, man, doth, extremely, covet, to, have, somewhat, in, his, understanding, fixed, and, unmovable, and, as, a, rest, and, support, of, the, mind, and, therefore, as, aristotle, endeavoureth, to, prove, that, in, all, motion, there, is, some, point, quiescent, and, as, he, elegantly, expoundeth, the, ancient, fable, of, atlas, (that, stood, fixed, and, bare, up, the, heaven, from, falling), to, be, meant, of, the, poles, or, axle-tree, of, heaven, whereupon, the, conversion, is, accomplished, so, assuredly, men, have, a, desire, to, have, an, atlas, or, axle-tree, within, to, keep, them, from, fluctuation, which, is, like, to, a, perpetual, peril, of, falling, therefore, men, did, hasten, to, set, down, some, principles, about, which, the, variety, of, their, disputatious, might, turn, (3), so, then, this, art, of, judgment, is, but, the, reduction, of, propositions, to, principles, in, a, middle, term, the, principles, to, be, agreed, by, all, and, exempted, from, argument, the, middle, term, to, be, elected, at, the, liberty, of, every, man’s, invention, the, reduction, to, be, of, two, kinds, direct, and, inverted, the, one, when, the, proposition, is, reduced, to, the, principle, which, they, term, a, probation, ostensive, the, other, when, the, contradictory, of, the, proposition, is, reduced, to, the, contradictory, of, the, principle, which, is, that, which, they, call, _per, incommodum_, or, pressing, an, absurdity, the, number, of, middle, terms, to, be, as, the, proposition, standeth, degrees, more, or, less, removed, from, the, principle, (4), but, this, art, hath, two, several, methods, of, doctrine, the, one, by, way, of, direction, the, other, by, way, of, caution, the, former, frameth, and, setteth, down, a, true, form, of, consequence, by, the, variations, and, deflections, from, which, errors, and, inconsequences, may, be, exactly, judged, toward, the, composition, and, structure, of, which, form, it, is, incident, to, handle, the, parts, thereof, which, are, propositions, and, the, parts, of, propositions, which, are, simple, words, and, this, is, that, part, of, logic, which, is, comprehended, in, the, analytics, (5), the, second, method, of, doctrine, was, introduced, for, expedite, use, and, assurance, sake, discovering, the, more, subtle, forms, of, sophisms, and, illaqueations, with, their, redargutions, which, is, that, which, is, termed, _elenches_, for, although, in, the, more, gross, sorts, of, fallacies, it, happeneth, (as, seneca, maketh, the, comparison, well), as, in, juggling, feats, which, though, we, know, not, how, they, are, done, yet, we, know, well, it, is, not, as, it, seemeth, to, be, yet, the, more, subtle, sort, of, them, doth, not, only, put, a, man, besides, his, answer, but, doth, many, times, abuse, his, judgment, (6), this, part, concerning, _elenches_, is, excellently, handled, by, aristotle, in, precept, but, more, excellently, by, plato, in, example, not, only, in, the, persons, of, the, sophists, but, even, in, socrates, himself, who, professing, to, affirm, nothing, but, to, infirm, that, which, was, affirmed, by, another, hath, exactly, expressed, all, the, forms, of, objection, fallace, and, redargution, and, although, we, have, said, that, the, use, of, this, doctrine, is, for, redargution, yet, it, is, manifest, the, degenerate, and, corrupt, use, is, for, caption, and, contradiction, which, passeth, for, a, great, faculty, and, no, doubt, is, of, very, great, advantage, though, the, difference, be, good, which, was, made, between, orators, and, sophisters, that, the, one, is, as, the, greyhound, which, hath, his, advantage, in, the, race, and, the, other, as, the, hare, which, hath, her, advantage, in, the, turn, so, as, it, is, the, advantage, of, the, weaker, creature, (7), but, yet, further, this, doctrine, of, elenches, hath, a, more, ample, latitude, and, extent, than, is, perceived, namely, unto, divers, parts, of, knowledge, whereof, some, are, laboured, and, other, omitted, for, first, conceive, (though, it, may, seem, at, first, somewhat, strange), that, that, part, which, is, variably, referred, sometimes, to, logic, sometimes, to, metaphysic, touching, the, common, adjuncts, of, essences, is, but, an, _elenche_, for, the, great, sophism, of, all, sophisms, being, equivocation, or, ambiguity, of, words, and, phrase, specially, of, such, words, as, are, most, general, and, intervene, in, every, inquiry, it, seemeth, to, me, that, the, true, and, fruitful, use, (leaving, vain, subtleties, and, speculations), of, the, inquiry, of, majority, minority, priority, posteriority, identity, diversity, possibility, act, totality, parts, existence, privation, and, the, like, are, but, wise, cautions, against, ambiguities, of, speech, so, again, the, distribution, of, things, into, certain, tribes, which, we, call, categories, or, predicaments, are, but, cautions, against, the, confusion, of, definitions, and, divisions, (8), secondly, there, is, a, seducement, that, worketh, by, the, strength, of, the, impression, and, not, by, the, subtlety, of, the, illaqueation—not, so, much, perplexing, the, reason, as, overruling, it, by, power, of, the, imagination, but, this, part, think, more, proper, to, handle, when, shall, speak, of, rhetoric, (9), but, lastly, there, is, yet, a, much, more, important, and, profound, kind, of, fallacies, in, the, mind, of, man, which, find, not, observed, or, inquired, at, all, and, think, good, to, place, here, as, that, which, of, all, others, appertaineth, most, to, rectify, judgment, the, force, whereof, is, such, as, it, doth, not, dazzle, or, snare, the, understanding, in, some, particulars, but, doth, more, generally, and, inwardly, infect, and, corrupt, the, state, thereof, for, the, mind, of, man, is, far, from, the, nature, of, a, clear, and, equal, glass, wherein, the, beams, of, things, should, reflect, according, to, their, true, incidence, nay, it, is, rather, like, an, enchanted, glass, full, of, superstition, and, imposture, if, it, be, not, delivered, and, reduced, for, this, purpose, let, us, consider, the, false, appearances, that, are, imposed, upon, us, by, the, general, nature, of, the, mind, beholding, them, in, an, example, or, two, as, first, in, that, instance, which, is, the, root, of, all, superstition, namely, that, to, the, nature, of, the, mind, of, all, men, it, is, consonant, for, the, affirmative, or, active, to, affect, more, than, the, negative, or, privative, so, that, a, few, times, hitting, or, presence, countervails, ofttimes, failing, or, absence, as, was, well, answered, by, diagoras, to, him, that, showed, him, in, neptune’s, temple, the, great, number, of, pictures, of, such, as, had, escaped, shipwreck, and, had, paid, their, vows, to, neptune, saying, “advise, now, you, that, think, it, folly, to, invocate, neptune, in, tempest, ”, “yea, but, ”, saith, diagoras, “where, are, they, painted, that, are, drowned, ”, let, us, behold, it, in, another, instance, namely, that, the, spirit, of, man, being, of, an, equal, and, uniform, substance, doth, usually, suppose, and, feign, in, nature, a, greater, equality, and, uniformity, than, is, in, truth, hence, it, cometh, that, the, mathematicians, cannot, satisfy, themselves, except, they, reduce, the, motions, of, the, celestial, bodies, to, perfect, circles, rejecting, spiral, lines, and, labouring, to, be, discharged, of, eccentrics, hence, it, cometh, that, whereas, there, are, many, things, in, nature, as, it, were, _monodica_, _sui, juris_, yet, the, cogitations, of, man, do, feign, unto, them, relatives, parallels, and, conjugates, whereas, no, such, thing, is, as, they, have, feigned, an, element, of, fire, to, keep, square, with, earth, water, and, air, and, the, like, nay, it, is, not, credible, till, it, be, opened, what, a, number, of, fictions, and, fantasies, the, similitude, of, human, actions, and, arts, together, with, the, making, of, man, _communis, mensura_, have, brought, into, natural, philosophy, not, much, better, than, the, heresy, of, the, anthropomorphites, bred, in, the, cells, of, gross, and, solitary, monks, and, the, opinion, of, epicurus, answerable, to, the, same, in, heathenism, who, supposed, the, gods, to, be, of, human, shape, and, therefore, velleius, the, epicurean, needed, not, to, have, asked, why, god, should, have, adorned, the, heavens, with, stars, as, if, he, had, been, an, _ædilis_, one, that, should, have, set, forth, some, magnificent, shows, or, plays, for, if, that, great, work-master, had, been, of, a, human, disposition, he, would, have, cast, the, stars, into, some, pleasant, and, beautiful, works, and, orders, like, the, frets, in, the, roofs, of, houses, whereas, one, can, scarce, find, a, posture, in, square, or, triangle, or, straight, line, amongst, such, an, infinite, number, so, differing, a, harmony, there, is, between, the, spirit, of, man, and, the, spirit, of, nature, (10), let, us, consider, again, the, false, appearances, imposed, upon, us, by, every, man’s, own, individual, nature, and, custom, in, that, feigned, supposition, that, plato, maketh, of, the, cave, for, certainly, if, a, child, were, continued, in, a, grot, or, cave, under, the, earth, until, maturity, of, age, and, came, suddenly, abroad, he, would, have, strange, and, absurd, imaginations, so, in, like, manner, although, our, persons, live, in, the, view, of, heaven, yet, our, spirits, are, included, in, the, caves, of, our, own, complexions, and, customs, which, minister, unto, us, infinite, errors, and, vain, opinions, if, they, be, not, recalled, to, examination, but, hereof, we, have, given, many, examples, in, one, of, the, errors, or, peccant, humours, which, we, ran, briefly, over, in, our, first, book, (11), and, lastly, let, us, consider, the, false, appearances, that, are, imposed, upon, us, by, words, which, are, framed, and, applied, according, to, the, conceit, and, capacities, of, the, vulgar, sort, and, although, we, think, we, govern, our, words, and, prescribe, it, well, _loquendum, ut, vulgus, sentiendum, ut, sapientes_, yet, certain, it, is, that, words, as, a, tartar’s, bow, do, shoot, back, upon, the, understanding, of, the, wisest, and, mightily, entangle, and, pervert, the, judgment, so, as, it, is, almost, necessary, in, all, controversies, and, disputations, to, imitate, the, wisdom, of, the, mathematicians, in, setting, down, in, the, very, beginning, the, definitions, of, our, words, and, terms, that, others, may, know, how, we, accept, and, understand, them, and, whether, they, concur, with, us, or, no, for, it, cometh, to, pass, for, want, of, this, that, we, are, sure, to, end, there, where, we, ought, to, have, begun, which, is, in, questions, and, differences, about, words, to, conclude, therefore, it, must, be, confessed, that, it, is, not, possible, to, divorce, ourselves, from, these, fallacies, and, false, appearances, because, they, are, inseparable, from, our, nature, and, condition, of, life, so, yet, nevertheless, the, caution, of, them, (for, all, elenches, as, was, said, are, but, cautions), doth, extremely, import, the, true, conduct, of, human, judgment, the, particular, elenches, or, cautions, against, these, three, false, appearances, find, altogether, deficient, (12), there, remaineth, one, part, of, judgment, of, great, excellency, which, to, mine, understanding, is, so, slightly, touched, as, may, report, that, also, deficient, which, is, the, application, of, the, differing, kinds, of, proofs, to, the, differing, kinds, of, subjects, for, there, being, but, four, kinds, of, demonstrations, that, is, by, the, immediate, consent, of, the, mind, or, sense, by, induction, by, syllogism, and, by, congruity, which, is, that, which, aristotle, calleth, demonstration, in, orb, or, circle, and, not, _a, notioribus_, every, of, these, hath, certain, subjects, in, the, matter, of, sciences, in, which, respectively, they, have, chiefest, use, and, certain, others, from, which, respectively, they, ought, to, be, excluded, and, the, rigour, and, curiosity, in, requiring, the, more, severe, proofs, in, some, things, and, chiefly, the, facility, in, contenting, ourselves, with, the, more, remiss, proofs, in, others, hath, been, amongst, the, greatest, causes, of, detriment, and, hindrance, to, knowledge, the, distributions, and, assignations, of, demonstrations, according, to, the, analogy, of, sciences, note, as, deficient, (1), the, custody, or, retaining, of, knowledge, is, either, in, writing, or, memory, whereof, writing, hath, two, parts, the, nature, of, the, character, and, the, order, of, the, entry, for, the, art, of, characters, or, other, visible, notes, of, words, or, things, it, hath, nearest, conjugation, with, grammar, and, therefore, refer, it, to, the, due, place, for, the, disposition, and, collocation, of, that, knowledge, which, we, preserve, in, writing, it, consisteth, in, a, good, digest, of, common-places, wherein, am, not, ignorant, of, the, prejudice, imputed, to, the, use, of, common-place, books, as, causing, a, retardation, of, reading, and, some, sloth, or, relaxation, of, memory, but, because, it, is, but, a, counterfeit, thing, in, knowledges, to, be, forward, and, pregnant, except, a, man, be, deep, and, full, hold, the, entry, of, common-places, to, be, a, matter, of, great, use, and, essence, in, studying, as, that, which, assureth, copy, of, invention, and, contracteth, judgment, to, a, strength, but, this, is, true, that, of, the, methods, of, common-places, that, have, seen, there, is, none, of, any, sufficient, worth, all, of, them, carrying, merely, the, face, of, a, school, and, not, of, a, world, and, referring, to, vulgar, matters, and, pedantical, divisions, without, all, life, or, respect, to, action, (2), for, the, other, principal, part, of, the, custody, of, knowledge, which, is, memory, find, that, faculty, in, my, judgment, weakly, inquired, of, an, art, there, is, extant, of, it, but, it, seemeth, to, me, that, there, are, better, precepts, than, that, art, and, better, practices, of, that, art, than, those, received, it, is, certain, the, art, (as, it, is), may, be, raised, to, points, of, ostentation, prodigious, but, in, use, (as, is, now, managed), it, is, barren, not, burdensome, nor, dangerous, to, natural, memory, as, is, imagined, but, barren, that, is, not, dexterous, to, be, applied, to, the, serious, use, of, business, and, occasions, and, therefore, make, no, more, estimation, of, repeating, a, great, number, of, names, or, words, upon, once, hearing, or, the, pouring, forth, of, a, number, of, verses, or, rhymes, _extempore_, or, the, making, of, a, satirical, simile, of, everything, or, the, turning, of, everything, to, a, jest, or, the, falsifying, or, contradicting, of, everything, by, cavil, or, the, like, (whereof, in, the, faculties, of, the, mind, there, is, great, copy, and, such, as, by, device, and, practice, may, be, exalted, to, an, extreme, degree, of, wonder), than, do, of, the, tricks, of, tumblers, funambuloes, baladines, the, one, being, the, same, in, the, mind, that, the, other, is, in, the, body, matters, of, strangeness, without, worthiness, (3), this, art, of, memory, is, but, built, upon, two, intentions, the, one, prenotion, the, other, emblem, prenotion, dischargeth, the, indefinite, seeking, of, that, we, would, remember, and, directeth, us, to, seek, in, a, narrow, compass, that, is, somewhat, that, hath, congruity, with, our, place, of, memory, emblem, reduceth, conceits, intellectual, to, images, sensible, which, strike, the, memory, more, out, of, which, axioms, may, be, drawn, much, better, practice, than, that, in, use, and, besides, which, axioms, there, are, divers, more, touching, help, of, memory, not, inferior, to, them, but, did, in, the, beginning, distinguish, not, to, report, those, things, deficient, which, are, but, only, ill, managed, (1), there, remaineth, the, fourth, kind, of, rational, knowledge, which, is, transitive, concerning, the, expressing, or, transferring, our, knowledge, to, others, which, will, term, by, the, general, name, of, tradition, or, delivery, tradition, hath, three, parts, the, first, concerning, the, organ, of, tradition, the, second, concerning, the, method, of, tradition, and, the, third, concerning, the, illustration, of, tradition, (2), for, the, organ, of, tradition, it, is, either, speech, or, writing, for, aristotle, saith, well, “words, are, the, images, of, cogitations, and, letters, are, the, images, of, words, ”, but, yet, it, is, not, of, necessity, that, cogitations, be, expressed, by, the, medium, of, words, for, whatsoever, is, capable, of, sufficient, differences, and, those, perceptible, by, the, sense, is, in, nature, competent, to, express, cogitations, and, therefore, we, see, in, the, commerce, of, barbarous, people, that, understand, not, one, another’s, language, and, in, the, practice, of, divers, that, are, dumb, and, deaf, that, men’s, minds, are, expressed, in, gestures, though, not, exactly, yet, to, serve, the, turn, and, we, understand, further, that, it, is, the, use, of, china, and, the, kingdoms, of, the, high, levant, to, write, in, characters, real, which, express, neither, letters, nor, words, in, gross, but, things, or, notions, insomuch, as, countries, and, provinces, which, understand, not, one, another’s, language, can, nevertheless, read, one, another’s, writings, because, the, characters, are, accepted, more, generally, than, the, languages, do, extend, and, therefore, they, have, a, vast, multitude, of, characters, as, many, suppose, as, radical, words, (3), these, notes, of, cogitations, are, of, two, sorts, the, one, when, the, note, hath, some, similitude, or, congruity, with, the, notion, the, other, _ad, placitum_, having, force, only, by, contract, or, acceptation, of, the, former, sort, are, hieroglyphics, and, gestures, for, as, to, hieroglyphics, (things, of, ancient, use, and, embraced, chiefly, by, the, egyptians, one, of, the, most, ancient, nations), they, are, but, as, continued, impresses, and, emblems, and, as, for, gestures, they, are, as, transitory, hieroglyphics, and, are, to, hieroglyphics, as, words, spoken, are, to, words, written, in, that, they, abide, not, but, they, have, evermore, as, well, as, the, other, an, affinity, with, the, things, signified, as, periander, being, consulted, with, how, to, preserve, a, tyranny, newly, usurped, bid, the, messenger, attend, and, report, what, he, saw, him, do, and, went, into, his, garden, and, topped, all, the, highest, flowers, signifying, that, it, consisted, in, the, cutting, off, and, keeping, low, of, the, nobility, and, grandees, _ad, placitum_, are, the, characters, real, before, mentioned, and, words, although, some, have, been, willing, by, curious, inquiry, or, rather, by, apt, feigning, to, have, derived, imposition, of, names, from, reason, and, intendment, a, speculation, elegant, and, by, reason, it, searcheth, into, antiquity, reverent, but, sparingly, mixed, with, truth, and, of, small, fruit, this, portion, of, knowledge, touching, the, notes, of, things, and, cogitations, in, general, find, not, inquired, but, deficient, and, although, it, may, seem, of, no, great, use, considering, that, words, and, writings, by, letters, do, far, excel, all, the, other, ways, yet, because, this, part, concerneth, as, it, were, the, mint, of, knowledge, (for, words, are, the, tokens, current, and, accepted, for, conceits, as, moneys, are, for, values, and, that, it, is, fit, men, be, not, ignorant, that, moneys, may, be, of, another, kind, than, gold, and, silver), thought, good, to, propound, it, to, better, inquiry, (4), concerning, speech, and, words, the, consideration, of, them, hath, produced, the, science, of, grammar, for, man, still, striveth, to, reintegrate, himself, in, those, benedictions, from, which, by, his, fault, he, hath, been, deprived, and, as, he, hath, striven, against, the, first, general, curse, by, the, invention, of, all, other, arts, so, hath, he, sought, to, come, forth, of, the, second, general, curse, (which, was, the, confusion, of, tongues), by, the, art, of, grammar, whereof, the, use, in, a, mother, tongue, is, small, in, a, foreign, tongue, more, but, most, in, such, foreign, tongues, as, have, ceased, to, be, vulgar, tongues, and, are, turned, only, to, learned, tongues, the, duty, of, it, is, of, two, natures, the, one, popular, which, is, for, the, speedy, and, perfect, attaining, languages, as, well, for, intercourse, of, speech, as, for, understanding, of, authors, the, other, philosophical, examining, the, power, and, nature, of, words, as, they, are, the, footsteps, and, prints, of, reason, which, kind, of, analogy, between, words, and, reason, is, handled, _sparsim_, brokenly, though, not, entirely, and, therefore, cannot, report, it, deficient, though, think, it, very, worthy, to, be, reduced, into, a, science, by, itself, (5), unto, grammar, also, belongeth, as, an, appendix, the, consideration, of, the, accidents, of, words, which, are, measure, sound, and, elevation, or, accent, and, the, sweetness, and, harshness, of, them, whence, hath, issued, some, curious, observations, in, rhetoric, but, chiefly, poesy, as, we, consider, it, in, respect, of, the, verse, and, not, of, the, argument, wherein, though, men, in, learned, tongues, do, tie, themselves, to, the, ancient, measures, yet, in, modern, languages, it, seemeth, to, me, as, free, to, make, new, measures, of, verses, as, of, dances, for, a, dance, is, a, measured, pace, as, a, verse, is, a, measured, speech, in, these, things, this, sense, is, better, judge, than, the, art, “cœnæ, fercula, nostræ, mallem, convivis, quam, placuisse, cocis, ”, and, of, the, servile, expressing, antiquity, in, an, unlike, and, an, unfit, subject, it, is, well, said, “_quod, tempore, antiquum, videtur_, _id, incongruitate, est, maxime, novum_, ”, (6), for, ciphers, they, are, commonly, in, letters, or, alphabets, but, may, be, in, words, the, kinds, of, ciphers, (besides, the, simple, ciphers, with, changes, and, intermixtures, of, nulls, and, non-significants), are, many, according, to, the, nature, or, rule, of, the, infolding, wheel-ciphers, key-ciphers, doubles, &c, but, the, virtues, of, them, whereby, they, are, to, be, preferred, are, three, that, they, be, not, laborious, to, write, and, read, that, they, be, impossible, to, decipher, and, in, some, cases, that, they, be, without, suspicion, the, highest, degree, whereof, is, to, write, _omnia, per, omnia_, which, is, undoubtedly, possible, with, a, proportion, quintuple, at, most, of, the, writing, infolding, to, the, writing, infolded, and, no, other, restraint, whatsoever, this, art, of, ciphering, hath, for, relative, an, art, of, deciphering, by, supposition, unprofitable, but, as, things, are, of, great, use, for, suppose, that, ciphers, were, well, managed, there, be, multitudes, of, them, which, exclude, the, decipherer, but, in, regard, of, the, rawness, and, unskilfulness, of, the, hands, through, which, they, pass, the, greatest, matters, are, many, times, carried, in, the, weakest, ciphers, (7), in, the, enumeration, of, these, private, and, retired, arts, it, may, be, thought, seek, to, make, a, great, muster-roll, of, sciences, naming, them, for, show, and, ostentation, and, to, little, other, purpose, but, let, those, which, are, skilful, in, them, judge, whether, bring, them, in, only, for, appearance, or, whether, in, that, which, speak, of, them, (though, in, few, words), there, be, not, some, seed, of, proficience, and, this, must, be, remembered, that, as, there, be, many, of, great, account, in, their, countries, and, provinces, which, when, they, come, up, to, the, seat, of, the, estate, are, but, of, mean, rank, and, scarcely, regarded, so, these, arts, being, here, placed, with, the, principal, and, supreme, sciences, seem, petty, things, yet, to, such, as, have, chosen, them, to, spend, their, labours, and, studies, in, them, they, seem, great, matters, (1), for, the, method, of, tradition, see, it, hath, moved, a, controversy, in, our, time, but, as, in, civil, business, if, there, be, a, meeting, and, men, fall, at, words, there, is, commonly, an, end, of, the, matter, for, that, time, and, no, proceeding, at, all, so, in, learning, where, there, is, much, controversy, there, is, many, times, little, inquiry, for, this, part, of, knowledge, of, method, seemeth, to, me, so, weakly, inquired, as, shall, report, it, deficient, (2), method, hath, been, placed, and, that, not, amiss, in, logic, as, a, part, of, judgment, for, as, the, doctrine, of, syllogisms, comprehendeth, the, rules, of, judgment, upon, that, which, is, invented, so, the, doctrine, of, method, containeth, the, rules, of, judgment, upon, that, which, is, to, be, delivered, for, judgment, precedeth, delivery, as, it, followeth, invention, neither, is, the, method, or, the, nature, of, the, tradition, material, only, to, the, use, of, knowledge, but, likewise, to, the, progression, of, knowledge, for, since, the, labour, and, life, of, one, man, cannot, attain, to, perfection, of, knowledge, the, wisdom, of, the, tradition, is, that, which, inspireth, the, felicity, of, continuance, and, proceeding, and, therefore, the, most, real, diversity, of, method, is, of, method, referred, to, use, and, method, referred, to, progression, whereof, the, one, may, be, termed, magistral, and, the, other, of, probation, (3), the, latter, whereof, seemeth, to, be, _via, deserta, et, interclusa_, for, as, knowledges, are, now, delivered, there, is, a, kind, of, contract, of, error, between, the, deliverer, and, the, receiver, for, he, that, delivereth, knowledge, desireth, to, deliver, it, in, such, form, as, may, be, best, believed, and, not, as, may, be, best, examined, and, he, that, receiveth, knowledge, desireth, rather, present, satisfaction, than, expectant, inquiry, and, so, rather, not, to, doubt, than, not, to, err, glory, making, the, author, not, to, lay, open, his, weakness, and, sloth, making, the, disciple, not, to, know, his, strength, (4), but, knowledge, that, is, delivered, as, a, thread, to, be, spun, on, ought, to, be, delivered, and, intimated, if, it, were, possible, in, the, same, method, wherein, it, was, invented, and, so, is, it, possible, of, knowledge, induced, but, in, this, same, anticipated, and, prevented, knowledge, no, man, knoweth, how, he, came, to, the, knowledge, which, he, hath, obtained, but, yet, nevertheless, _secundum, majus, et, minus_, a, man, may, revisit, and, descend, unto, the, foundations, of, his, knowledge, and, consent, and, so, transplant, it, into, another, as, it, grew, in, his, own, mind, for, it, is, in, knowledges, as, it, is, in, plants, if, you, mean, to, use, the, plant, it, is, no, matter, for, the, roots—but, if, you, mean, to, remove, it, to, grow, then, it, is, more, assured, to, rest, upon, roots, than, slips, so, the, delivery, of, knowledges, (as, it, is, now, used), is, as, of, fair, bodies, of, trees, without, the, roots, good, for, the, carpenter, but, not, for, the, planter, but, if, you, will, have, sciences, grow, it, is, less, matter, for, the, shaft, or, body, of, the, tree, so, you, look, well, to, the, taking, up, of, the, roots, of, which, kind, of, delivery, the, method, of, the, mathematics, in, that, subject, hath, some, shadow, but, generally, see, it, neither, put, in, use, nor, put, in, inquisition, and, therefore, note, it, for, deficient, (5), another, diversity, of, method, there, is, which, hath, some, affinity, with, the, former, used, in, some, cases, by, the, discretion, of, the, ancients, but, disgraced, since, by, the, impostures, of, many, vain, persons, who, have, made, it, as, a, false, light, for, their, counterfeit, merchandises, and, that, is, enigmatical, and, disclosed, the, pretence, whereof, is, to, remove, the, vulgar, capacities, from, being, admitted, to, the, secrets, of, knowledges, and, to, reserve, them, to, selected, auditors, or, wits, of, such, sharpness, as, can, pierce, the, veil, (6), another, diversity, of, method, whereof, the, consequence, is, great, is, the, delivery, of, knowledge, in, aphorisms, or, in, methods, wherein, we, may, observe, that, it, hath, been, too, much, taken, into, custom, out, of, a, few, axioms, or, observations, upon, any, subject, to, make, a, solemn, and, formal, art, filling, it, with, some, discourses, and, illustrating, it, with, examples, and, digesting, it, into, a, sensible, method, but, the, writing, in, aphorisms, hath, many, excellent, virtues, whereto, the, writing, in, method, doth, not, approach, (7), for, first, it, trieth, the, writer, whether, he, be, superficial, or, solid, for, aphorisms, except, they, should, be, ridiculous, cannot, be, made, but, of, the, pith, and, heart, of, sciences, for, discourse, of, illustration, is, cut, off, recitals, of, examples, are, cut, off, discourse, of, connection, and, order, is, cut, off, descriptions, of, practice, are, cut, off, so, there, remaineth, nothing, to, fill, the, aphorisms, but, some, good, quantity, of, observation, and, therefore, no, man, can, suffice, nor, in, reason, will, attempt, to, write, aphorisms, but, he, that, is, sound, and, grounded, but, in, methods, “tantum, series, juncturaque, pollet, tantum, de, medio, sumptis, accedit, honoris, ”, as, a, man, shall, make, a, great, show, of, an, art, which, if, it, were, disjointed, would, come, to, little, secondly, methods, are, more, fit, to, win, consent, or, belief, but, less, fit, to, point, to, action, for, they, carry, a, kind, of, demonstration, in, orb, or, circle, one, part, illuminating, another, and, therefore, satisfy, but, particulars, being, dispersed, do, best, agree, with, dispersed, directions, and, lastly, aphorisms, representing, a, knowledge, broken, do, invite, men, to, inquire, further, whereas, methods, carrying, the, show, of, a, total, do, secure, men, as, if, they, were, at, furthest, (8), another, diversity, of, method, which, is, likewise, of, great, weight, is, the, handling, of, knowledge, by, assertions, and, their, proofs, or, by, questions, and, their, determinations, the, latter, kind, whereof, if, it, be, immoderately, followed, is, as, prejudicial, to, the, proceeding, of, learning, as, it, is, to, the, proceeding, of, an, army, to, go, about, to, besiege, every, little, fort, or, hold, for, if, the, field, be, kept, and, the, sum, of, the, enterprise, pursued, those, smaller, things, will, come, in, of, themselves, indeed, a, man, would, not, leave, some, important, piece, enemy, at, his, back, in, like, manner, the, use, of, confutation, in, the, delivery, of, sciences, ought, to, be, very, sparing, and, to, serve, to, remove, strong, preoccupations, and, prejudgments, and, not, to, minister, and, excite, disputatious, and, doubts, (9), another, diversity, of, method, is, according, to, the, subject, or, matter, which, is, handled, for, there, is, a, great, difference, in, delivery, of, the, mathematics, which, are, the, most, abstracted, of, knowledges, and, policy, which, is, the, most, immersed, and, howsoever, contention, hath, been, moved, touching, a, uniformity, of, method, in, multiformity, of, matter, yet, we, see, how, that, opinion, besides, the, weakness, of, it, hath, been, of, ill, desert, towards, learning, as, that, which, taketh, the, way, to, reduce, learning, to, certain, empty, and, barren, generalities, being, but, the, very, husks, and, shells, of, sciences, all, the, kernel, being, forced, out, and, expulsed, with, the, torture, and, press, of, the, method, and, therefore, as, did, allow, well, of, particular, topics, for, invention, so, do, allow, likewise, of, particular, methods, of, tradition, (10), another, diversity, of, judgment, in, the, delivery, and, teaching, of, knowledge, is, according, unto, the, light, and, presuppositions, of, that, which, is, delivered, for, that, knowledge, which, is, new, and, foreign, from, opinions, received, is, to, be, delivered, in, another, form, than, that, that, is, agreeable, and, familiar, and, therefore, aristotle, when, he, thinks, to, tax, democritus, doth, in, truth, commend, him, where, he, saith, “if, we, shall, indeed, dispute, and, not, follow, after, similitudes, ”, &c, for, those, whose, conceits, are, seated, in, popular, opinions, need, only, but, to, prove, or, dispute, but, those, whose, conceits, are, beyond, popular, opinions, have, a, double, labour, the, one, to, make, themselves, conceived, and, the, other, to, prove, and, demonstrate, so, that, it, is, of, necessity, with, them, to, have, recourse, to, similitudes, and, translations, to, express, themselves, and, therefore, in, the, infancy, of, learning, and, in, rude, times, when, those, conceits, which, are, now, trivial, were, then, new, the, world, was, full, of, parables, and, similitudes, for, else, would, men, either, have, passed, over, without, mark, or, else, rejected, for, paradoxes, that, which, was, offered, before, they, had, understood, or, judged, so, in, divine, learning, we, see, how, frequent, parables, and, tropes, are, for, it, is, a, rule, that, whatsoever, science, is, not, consonant, to, presuppositions, must, pray, in, aid, of, similitudes, (11), there, be, also, other, diversities, of, methods, vulgar, and, received, as, that, of, resolution, or, analysis, of, constitution, or, systasis, of, concealment, or, cryptic, &c, which, do, allow, well, of, though, have, stood, upon, those, which, are, least, handled, and, observed, all, which, have, remembered, to, this, purpose, because, would, erect, and, constitute, one, general, inquiry, (which, seems, to, me, deficient), touching, the, wisdom, of, tradition, (12), but, unto, this, part, of, knowledge, concerning, method, doth, further, belong, not, only, the, architecture, of, the, whole, frame, of, a, work, but, also, the, several, beams, and, columns, thereof, not, as, to, their, stuff, but, as, to, their, quantity, and, figure, and, therefore, method, considereth, not, only, the, disposition, of, the, argument, or, subject, but, likewise, the, propositions, not, as, to, their, truth, or, matter, but, as, to, their, limitation, and, manner, for, herein, ramus, merited, better, a, great, deal, in, reviving, the, good, rules, of, propositions—καθολον, πρωτον, κυτα, παντος, &c, —than, he, did, in, introducing, the, canker, of, epitomes, and, yet, (as, it, is, the, condition, of, human, things, that, according, to, the, ancient, fables, “the, most, precious, things, have, the, most, pernicious, keepers”), it, was, so, that, the, attempt, of, the, one, made, him, fall, upon, the, other, for, he, had, need, be, well, conducted, that, should, design, to, make, axioms, convertible, if, he, make, them, not, withal, circular, and, non-promovent, or, incurring, into, themselves, but, yet, the, intention, was, excellent, (13), the, other, considerations, of, method, concerning, propositions, are, chiefly, touching, the, utmost, propositions, which, limit, the, dimensions, of, sciences, for, every, knowledge, may, be, fitly, said, besides, the, profundity, (which, is, the, truth, and, substance, of, it, that, makes, it, solid), to, have, a, longitude, and, a, latitude, accounting, the, latitude, towards, other, sciences, and, the, longitude, towards, action, that, is, from, the, greatest, generality, to, the, most, particular, precept, the, one, giveth, rule, how, far, one, knowledge, ought, to, intermeddle, within, the, province, of, another, which, is, the, rule, they, call, καθαυτο, the, other, giveth, rule, unto, what, degree, of, particularity, a, knowledge, should, descend, which, latter, find, passed, over, in, silence, being, in, my, judgment, the, more, material, for, certainty, there, must, be, somewhat, left, to, practice, but, how, much, is, worthy, the, inquiry, we, see, remote, and, superficial, generalities, do, but, offer, knowledge, to, scorn, of, practical, men, and, are, no, more, aiding, to, practice, than, an, ortelius’, universal, map, is, to, direct, the, way, between, london, and, york, the, better, sort, of, rules, have, been, not, unfitly, compared, to, glasses, of, steel, unpolished, where, you, may, see, the, images, of, things, but, first, they, must, be, filed, so, the, rules, will, help, if, they, be, laboured, and, polished, by, practice, but, how, crystalline, they, may, be, made, at, the, first, and, how, far, forth, they, may, be, polished, aforehand, is, the, question, the, inquiry, whereof, seemeth, to, me, deficient, (14), there, hath, been, also, laboured, and, put, in, practice, a, method, which, is, not, a, lawful, method, but, a, method, of, imposture, which, is, to, deliver, knowledges, in, such, manner, as, men, may, speedily, come, to, make, a, show, of, learning, who, have, it, not, such, was, the, travail, of, raymundus, lullius, in, making, that, art, which, bears, his, name, not, unlike, to, some, books, of, typocosmy, which, have, been, made, since, being, nothing, but, a, mass, of, words, of, all, arts, to, give, men, countenance, that, those, which, use, the, terms, might, be, thought, to, understand, the, art, which, collections, are, much, like, a, fripper’s, or, broker’s, shop, that, hath, ends, of, everything, but, nothing, of, worth, (1), now, we, descend, to, that, part, which, concerneth, the, illustration, of, tradition, comprehended, in, that, science, which, we, call, rhetoric, or, art, of, eloquence, a, science, excellent, and, excellently, well, laboured, for, although, in, true, value, it, is, inferior, to, wisdom, (as, it, is, said, by, god, to, moses, when, he, disabled, himself, for, want, of, this, faculty, “aaron, shall, be, thy, speaker, and, thou, shalt, be, to, him, as, god”), yet, with, people, it, is, the, more, mighty, for, so, solomon, saith, _sapiens, corde, appellabitur, prudens_, _sed, dulcis, eloquio, majora, reperiet_, signifying, that, profoundness, of, wisdom, will, help, a, man, to, a, name, or, admiration, but, that, it, is, eloquence, that, prevaileth, in, an, active, life, and, as, to, the, labouring, of, it, the, emulation, of, aristotle, with, the, rhetoricians, of, his, time, and, the, experience, of, cicero, hath, made, them, in, their, works, of, rhetoric, exceed, themselves, again, the, excellency, of, examples, of, eloquence, in, the, orations, of, demosthenes, and, cicero, added, to, the, perfection, of, the, precepts, of, eloquence, hath, doubled, the, progression, in, this, art, and, therefore, the, deficiences, which, shall, note, will, rather, be, in, some, collections, which, may, as, handmaids, attend, the, art, than, in, the, rules, or, use, of, the, art, itself, (2), notwithstanding, to, stir, the, earth, a, little, about, the, roots, of, this, science, as, we, have, done, of, the, rest, the, duty, and, office, of, rhetoric, is, to, apply, reason, to, imagination, for, the, better, moving, of, the, will, for, we, see, reason, is, disturbed, in, the, administration, thereof, by, three, means—by, illaqueation, or, sophism, which, pertains, to, logic, by, imagination, or, impression, which, pertains, to, rhetoric, and, by, passion, or, affection, which, pertains, to, morality, and, as, in, negotiation, with, others, men, are, wrought, by, cunning, by, importunity, and, by, vehemency, so, in, this, negotiation, within, ourselves, men, are, undermined, by, inconsequences, solicited, and, importuned, by, impressions, or, observations, and, transported, by, passions, neither, is, the, nature, of, man, so, unfortunately, built, as, that, those, powers, and, arts, should, have, force, to, disturb, reason, and, not, to, establish, and, advance, it, for, the, end, of, logic, is, to, teach, a, form, of, argument, to, secure, reason, and, not, to, entrap, it, the, end, of, morality, is, to, procure, the, affections, to, obey, reason, and, not, to, invade, it, the, end, of, rhetoric, is, to, fill, the, imagination, to, second, reason, and, not, to, oppress, it, for, these, abuses, of, arts, come, in, but, _ex, oblique_, for, caution, (3), and, therefore, it, was, great, injustice, in, plato, though, springing, out, of, a, just, hatred, to, the, rhetoricians, of, his, time, to, esteem, of, rhetoric, but, as, a, voluptuary, art, resembling, it, to, cookery, that, did, mar, wholesome, meats, and, help, unwholesome, by, variety, of, sauces, to, the, pleasure, of, the, taste, for, we, see, that, speech, is, much, more, conversant, in, adorning, that, which, is, good, than, in, colouring, that, which, is, evil, for, there, is, no, man, but, speaketh, more, honestly, than, he, can, do, or, think, and, it, was, excellently, noted, by, thucydides, in, cleon, that, because, he, used, to, hold, on, the, bad, side, in, causes, of, estate, therefore, he, was, ever, inveighing, against, eloquence, and, good, speech, knowing, that, no, man, can, speak, fair, of, courses, sordid, and, base, and, therefore, as, plato, said, elegantly, “that, virtue, if, she, could, be, seen, would, move, great, love, and, affection, ”, so, seeing, that, she, cannot, be, showed, to, the, sense, by, corporal, shape, the, next, degree, is, to, show, her, to, the, imagination, in, lively, representation, for, to, show, her, to, reason, only, in, subtlety, of, argument, was, a, thing, ever, derided, in, chrysippus, and, many, of, the, stoics, who, thought, to, thrust, virtue, upon, men, by, sharp, disputations, and, conclusions, which, have, no, sympathy, with, the, will, of, man, (4), again, if, the, affections, in, themselves, were, pliant, and, obedient, to, reason, it, were, true, there, should, be, no, great, use, of, persuasions, and, insinuations, to, the, will, more, than, of, naked, proposition, and, proofs, but, in, regard, of, the, continual, mutinies, and, seditious, of, the, affections—, “video, meliora, proboque, deteriora, sequor, ”, reason, would, become, captive, and, servile, if, eloquence, of, persuasions, did, not, practise, and, win, the, imagination, from, the, affections’, part, and, contract, a, confederacy, between, the, reason, and, imagination, against, the, affections, for, the, affections, themselves, carry, ever, an, appetite, to, good, as, reason, doth, the, difference, is, that, the, affection, beholdeth, merely, the, present, reason, beholdeth, the, future, and, sum, of, time, and, therefore, the, present, filling, the, imagination, more, reason, is, commonly, vanquished, but, after, that, force, of, eloquence, and, persuasion, hath, made, things, future, and, remote, appear, as, present, then, upon, the, revolt, of, the, imagination, reason, prevaileth, (5), we, conclude, therefore, that, rhetoric, can, be, no, more, charged, with, the, colouring, of, the, worst, part, than, logic, with, sophistry, or, morality, with, vice, for, we, know, the, doctrines, of, contraries, are, the, same, though, the, use, be, opposite, it, appeareth, also, that, logic, differeth, from, rhetoric, not, only, as, the, fist, from, the, palm—the, one, close, the, other, at, large—but, much, more, in, this, that, logic, handleth, reason, exact, and, in, truth, and, rhetoric, handleth, it, as, it, is, planted, in, popular, opinions, and, manners, and, therefore, aristotle, doth, wisely, place, rhetoric, as, between, logic, on, the, one, side, and, moral, or, civil, knowledge, on, the, other, as, participating, of, both, for, the, proofs, and, demonstrations, of, logic, are, toward, all, men, indifferent, and, the, same, but, the, proofs, and, persuasions, of, rhetoric, ought, to, differ, according, to, the, auditors, “orpheus, in, sylvis, inter, delphinas, arion, ”, which, application, in, perfection, of, idea, ought, to, extend, so, far, that, if, a, man, should, speak, of, the, same, thing, to, several, persons, he, should, speak, to, them, all, respectively, and, several, ways, though, this, politic, part, of, eloquence, in, private, speech, it, is, easy, for, the, greatest, orators, to, want, whilst, by, the, observing, their, well-graced, forms, of, speech, they, leese, the, volubility, of, application, and, therefore, it, shall, not, be, amiss, to, recommend, this, to, better, inquiry, not, being, curious, whether, we, place, it, here, or, in, that, part, which, concerneth, policy, (6), now, therefore, will, descend, to, the, deficiences, which, as, said, are, but, attendances, and, first, do, not, find, the, wisdom, and, diligence, of, aristotle, well, pursued, who, began, to, make, a, collection, of, the, popular, signs, and, colours, of, good, and, evil, both, simple, and, comparative, which, are, as, the, sophisms, of, rhetoric, (as, touched, before), for, example—, “sophisma, quod, laudatur, bonum, quod, vituperatur, malum, redargutio, laudat, venales, qui, vult, extrudere, merces, ”, _malum, est_, _malum, est_, (_inquit, emptor_), _sed, cum, recesserit_, _tum, gloriabitur_, the, defects, in, the, labour, of, aristotle, are, three—one, that, there, be, but, a, few, of, many, another, that, there, elenches, are, not, annexed, and, the, third, that, he, conceived, but, a, part, of, the, use, of, them, for, their, use, is, not, only, in, probation, but, much, more, in, impression, for, many, forms, are, equal, in, signification, which, are, differing, in, impression, as, the, difference, is, great, in, the, piercing, of, that, which, is, sharp, and, that, which, is, flat, though, the, strength, of, the, percussion, be, the, same, for, there, is, no, man, but, will, be, a, little, more, raised, by, hearing, it, said, “your, enemies, will, be, glad, of, this”—, “hoc, ithacus, velit, et, magno, mercentur, atridæ, ”, than, by, hearing, it, said, only, “this, is, evil, for, you, ”, (7), secondly, do, resume, also, that, which, mentioned, before, touching, provision, or, preparatory, store, for, the, furniture, of, speech, and, readiness, of, invention, which, appeareth, to, be, of, two, sorts, the, one, in, resemblance, to, a, shop, of, pieces, unmade, up, the, other, to, a, shop, of, things, ready, made, up, both, to, be, applied, to, that, which, is, frequent, and, most, in, request, the, former, of, these, will, call, _antitheta_, and, the, latter, _formulæ_, (8), _antitheta_, are, theses, argued, _pro, et, contra_, wherein, men, may, be, more, large, and, laborious, but, (in, such, as, are, able, to, do, it), to, avoid, prolixity, of, entry, wish, the, seeds, of, the, several, arguments, to, be, cast, up, into, some, brief, and, acute, sentences, not, to, be, cited, but, to, be, as, skeins, or, bottoms, of, thread, to, be, unwinded, at, large, when, they, come, to, be, used, supplying, authorities, and, examples, by, reference, “_pro, verbis, legis_, non, est, interpretatio, sed, divinatio, quæ, recedit, a, litera, cum, receditur, a, litera, judex, transit, in, legislatorem, _pro, sententia, legis_, ex, omnibus, verbis, est, eliciendus, sensus, qui, interpretatur, singula, ”, (9), _formulæ_, are, but, decent, and, apt, passages, or, conveyances, of, speech, which, may, serve, indifferently, for, differing, subjects, as, of, preface, conclusion, digression, transition, excusation, &c, for, as, in, buildings, there, is, great, pleasure, and, use, in, the, well, casting, of, the, staircases, entries, doors, windows, and, the, like, so, in, speech, the, conveyances, and, passages, are, of, special, ornament, and, effect, conclusion, in, a, deliberative_, so, may, we, redeem, the, faults, passed, and, prevent, the, inconveniences, future, ”, (1), there, remain, two, appendices, touching, the, tradition, of, knowledge, the, one, critical, the, other, pedantical, for, all, knowledge, is, either, delivered, by, teachers, or, attained, by, men’s, proper, endeavours, and, therefore, as, the, principal, part, of, tradition, of, knowledge, concerneth, chiefly, writing, of, books, so, the, relative, part, thereof, concerneth, reading, of, books, whereunto, appertain, incidently, these, considerations, the, first, is, concerning, the, true, correction, and, edition, of, authors, wherein, nevertheless, rash, diligence, hath, done, great, prejudice, for, these, critics, have, often, presumed, that, that, which, they, understand, not, is, false, set, down, as, the, priest, that, where, he, found, it, written, of, st, paul, _demissus, est, per, sportam_, mended, his, book, and, made, it, _demissus, est, per, portam_, because, _sporta_, was, a, hard, word, and, out, of, his, reading, and, surely, their, errors, though, they, be, not, so, palpable, and, ridiculous, yet, are, of, the, same, kind, and, therefore, as, it, hath, been, wisely, noted, the, most, corrected, copies, are, commonly, the, least, correct, the, second, is, concerning, the, exposition, and, explication, of, authors, which, resteth, in, annotations, and, commentaries, wherein, it, is, over, usual, to, blanch, the, obscure, places, and, discourse, upon, the, plain, the, third, is, concerning, the, times, which, in, many, cases, give, great, light, to, true, interpretations, the, fourth, is, concerning, some, brief, censure, and, judgment, of, the, authors, that, men, thereby, may, make, some, election, unto, themselves, what, books, to, read, and, the, fifth, is, concerning, the, syntax, and, disposition, of, studies, that, men, may, know, in, what, order, or, pursuit, to, read, (2), for, pedantical, knowledge, it, containeth, that, difference, of, tradition, which, is, proper, for, youth, whereunto, appertain, divers, considerations, of, great, fruit, as, first, the, timing, and, seasoning, of, knowledges, as, with, what, to, initiate, them, and, from, what, for, a, time, to, refrain, them, secondly, the, consideration, where, to, begin, with, the, easiest, and, so, proceed, to, the, more, difficult, and, in, what, courses, to, press, the, more, difficult, and, then, to, turn, them, to, the, more, easy, for, it, is, one, method, to, practise, swimming, with, bladders, and, another, to, practise, dancing, with, heavy, shoes, third, is, the, application, of, learning, according, unto, the, propriety, of, the, wits, for, there, is, no, defect, in, the, faculties, intellectual, but, seemeth, to, have, a, proper, cure, contained, in, some, studies, as, for, example, if, a, child, be, bird-witted, that, is, hath, not, the, faculty, of, attention, the, mathematics, giveth, a, remedy, thereunto, for, in, them, if, the, wit, be, caught, away, but, a, moment, one, is, new, to, begin, and, as, sciences, have, a, propriety, towards, faculties, for, cure, and, help, so, faculties, or, powers, have, a, sympathy, towards, sciences, for, excellency, or, speedy, profiting, and, therefore, it, is, an, inquiry, of, great, wisdom, what, kinds, of, wits, and, natures, are, most, apt, and, proper, for, what, sciences, fourthly, the, ordering, of, exercises, is, matter, of, great, consequence, to, hurt, or, help, for, as, is, well, observed, by, cicero, men, in, exercising, their, faculties, if, they, be, not, well, advised, do, exercise, their, faults, and, get, ill, habits, as, well, as, good, so, as, there, is, a, great, judgment, to, be, had, in, the, continuance, and, intermission, of, exercises, it, were, too, long, to, particularise, a, number, of, other, considerations, of, this, nature, things, but, of, mean, appearance, but, of, singular, efficacy, for, as, the, wronging, or, cherishing, of, seeds, or, young, plants, is, that, that, is, most, important, to, their, thriving, and, as, it, was, noted, that, the, first, six, kings, being, in, truth, as, tutors, of, the, state, of, rome, in, the, infancy, thereof, was, the, principal, cause, of, the, immense, greatness, of, that, state, which, followed, so, the, culture, and, manurance, of, minds, in, youth, hath, such, a, forcible, (though, unseen), operation, as, hardly, any, length, of, time, or, contention, of, labour, can, countervail, it, afterwards, and, it, is, not, amiss, to, observe, also, how, small, and, mean, faculties, gotten, by, education, yet, when, they, fall, into, great, men, or, great, matters, do, work, great, and, important, effects, whereof, we, see, a, notable, example, in, tacitus, of, two, stage, players, percennius, and, vibulenus, who, by, their, faculty, of, playing, put, the, pannonian, armies, into, an, extreme, tumult, and, combustion, for, there, arising, a, mutiny, amongst, them, upon, the, death, of, augustus, cæsar, blæsus, the, lieutenant, had, committed, some, of, the, mutineers, which, were, suddenly, rescued, whereupon, vibulenus, got, to, be, heard, speak, which, he, did, in, this, manner, —“these, poor, innocent, wretches, appointed, to, cruel, death, you, have, restored, to, behold, the, light, but, who, shall, restore, my, brother, to, me, or, life, unto, my, brother, that, was, sent, hither, in, message, from, the, legions, of, germany, to, treat, of, the, common, cause, and, he, hath, murdered, him, this, last, night, by, some, of, his, fencers, and, ruffians, that, he, hath, about, him, for, his, executioners, upon, soldiers, answer, blæsus, what, is, done, with, his, body, the, mortalest, enemies, do, not, deny, burial, when, have, performed, my, last, duties, to, the, corpse, with, kisses, with, tears, command, me, to, be, slain, besides, him, so, that, these, my, fellows, for, our, good, meaning, and, our, true, hearts, to, the, legions, may, have, leave, to, bury, us, ”, with, which, speech, he, put, the, army, into, an, infinite, fury, and, uproar, whereas, truth, was, he, had, no, brother, neither, was, there, any, such, matter, but, he, played, it, merely, as, if, he, had, been, upon, the, stage, (3), but, to, return, we, are, now, come, to, a, period, of, rational, knowledges, wherein, if, have, made, the, divisions, other, than, those, that, are, received, yet, would, not, be, thought, to, disallow, all, those, divisions, which, do, not, use, for, there, is, a, double, necessity, imposed, upon, me, of, altering, the, divisions, the, one, because, it, differeth, in, end, and, purpose, to, sort, together, those, things, which, are, next, in, nature, and, those, things, which, are, next, in, use, for, if, a, secretary, of, estate, should, sort, his, papers, it, is, like, in, his, study, or, general, cabinet, he, would, sort, together, things, of, a, nature, as, treaties, instructions, &c, but, in, his, boxes, or, particular, cabinet, he, would, sort, together, those, that, he, were, like, to, use, together, though, of, several, natures, so, in, this, general, cabinet, of, knowledge, it, was, necessary, for, me, to, follow, the, divisions, of, the, nature, of, things, whereas, if, myself, had, been, to, handle, any, particular, knowledge, would, have, respected, the, divisions, fittest, for, use, the, other, because, the, bringing, in, of, the, deficiences, did, by, consequence, alter, the, partitions, of, the, rest, for, let, the, knowledge, extant, (for, demonstration, sake), be, fifteen, let, the, knowledge, with, the, deficiences, be, twenty, the, parts, of, fifteen, are, not, the, parts, of, twenty, for, the, parts, of, fifteen, are, three, and, five, the, parts, of, twenty, are, two, four, five, and, ten, so, as, these, things, are, without, contradiction, and, could, not, otherwise, be, (1), we, proceed, now, to, that, knowledge, which, considereth, of, the, appetite, and, will, of, man, whereof, solomon, saith, _ante, omnia_, _fili_, _custodi, cor, tuum_, _nam, inde, procedunt, actiones, vitæ_, in, the, handling, of, this, science, those, which, have, written, seem, to, me, to, have, done, as, if, a, man, that, professed, to, teach, to, write, did, only, exhibit, fair, copies, of, alphabets, and, letters, joined, without, giving, any, precepts, or, directions, for, the, carriage, of, the, hand, and, framing, of, the, letters, so, have, they, made, good, and, fair, exemplars, and, copies, carrying, the, draughts, and, portraitures, of, good, virtue, duty, felicity, propounding, them, well, described, as, the, true, objects, and, scopes, of, man’s, will, and, desires, but, how, to, attain, these, excellent, marks, and, how, to, frame, and, subdue, the, will, of, man, to, become, true, and, conformable, to, these, pursuits, they, pass, it, over, altogether, or, slightly, and, unprofitably, for, it, is, not, the, disputing, that, moral, virtues, are, in, the, mind, of, man, by, habit, and, not, by, nature, or, the, distinguishing, that, generous, spirits, are, won, by, doctrines, and, persuasions, and, the, vulgar, sort, by, reward, and, punishment, and, the, like, scattered, glances, and, touches, that, can, excuse, the, absence, of, this, part, (2), the, reason, of, this, omission, suppose, to, be, that, hidden, rock, whereupon, both, this, and, many, other, barks, of, knowledge, have, been, cast, away, which, is, that, men, have, despised, to, be, conversant, in, ordinary, and, common, matters, the, judicious, direction, whereof, nevertheless, is, the, wisest, doctrine, (for, life, consisteth, not, in, novelties, nor, subtleties), but, contrariwise, they, have, compounded, sciences, chiefly, of, a, certain, resplendent, or, lustrous, mass, of, matter, chosen, to, give, glory, either, to, the, subtlety, of, disputatious, or, to, the, eloquence, of, discourses, but, seneca, giveth, an, excellent, check, to, eloquence, _nocet, illis, eloquentia_, _quibus, non, rerum, cupiditatem, facit_, _sed, sui_, doctrine, should, be, such, as, should, make, men, in, love, with, the, lesson, and, not, with, the, teacher, being, directed, to, the, auditor’s, benefit, and, not, to, the, author’s, commendation, and, therefore, those, are, of, the, right, kind, which, may, be, concluded, as, demosthenes, concludes, his, counsel, _quæ, si, feceritis_, _non, oratorem, dumtaxat, in, præsentia, laudabitis_, _sed, vosmetipsos, etiam, non, ita, multo, post, statu, rerum, vestraram, meliore_, (3), neither, needed, men, of, so, excellent, parts, to, have, despaired, of, a, fortune, which, the, poet, virgil, promised, himself, and, indeed, obtained, who, got, as, much, glory, of, eloquence, wit, and, learning, in, the, expressing, of, the, observations, of, husbandry, as, of, the, heroical, acts, of, æneas, “nec, sum, animi, dubius, verbis, ea, vincere, magnum, quam, sit, et, angustis, his, addere, rebus, honorem, ”, and, surely, if, the, purpose, be, in, good, earnest, not, to, write, at, leisure, that, which, men, may, read, at, leisure, but, really, to, instruct, and, suborn, action, and, active, life, these, georgics, of, the, mind, concerning, the, husbandry, and, tillage, thereof, are, no, less, worthy, than, the, heroical, descriptions, of, virtue, duty, and, felicity, wherefore, the, main, and, primitive, division, of, moral, knowledge, seemeth, to, be, into, the, exemplar, or, platform, of, good, and, the, regiment, or, culture, of, the, mind, the, one, describing, the, nature, of, good, the, other, prescribing, rules, how, to, subdue, apply, and, accommodate, the, will, of, man, thereunto, (4), the, doctrine, touching, the, platform, or, nature, of, good, considereth, it, either, simple, or, compared, either, the, kinds, of, good, or, the, degrees, of, good, in, the, latter, whereof, those, infinite, disputatious, which, were, touching, the, supreme, degree, thereof, which, they, term, felicity, beatitude, or, the, highest, good, the, doctrines, concerning, which, were, as, the, heathen, divinity, are, by, the, christian, faith, discharged, and, as, aristotle, saith, “that, young, men, may, be, happy, but, not, otherwise, but, by, hope, ”, so, we, must, all, acknowledge, our, minority, and, embrace, the, felicity, which, is, by, hope, of, the, future, world, (5), freed, therefore, and, delivered, from, this, doctrine, of, the, philosopher’s, heaven, whereby, they, feigned, a, higher, elevation, of, man’s, nature, than, was, (for, we, see, in, what, height, of, style, seneca, writeth, _vere, magnum_, _habere, fragilitatem, hominis_, _securitatem, dei_), we, may, with, more, sobriety, and, truth, receive, the, rest, of, their, inquiries, and, labours, wherein, for, the, nature, of, good, positive, or, simple, they, have, set, it, down, excellently, in, describing, the, forms, of, virtue, and, duty, with, their, situations, and, postures, in, distributing, them, into, their, kinds, parts, provinces, actions, and, administrations, and, the, like, nay, further, they, have, commended, them, to, man’s, nature, and, spirit, with, great, quickness, of, argument, and, beauty, of, persuasions, yea, and, fortified, and, entrenched, them, (as, much, as, discourse, can, do), against, corrupt, and, popular, opinions, again, for, the, degrees, and, comparative, nature, of, good, they, have, also, excellently, handled, it, in, their, triplicity, of, good, in, the, comparisons, between, a, contemplative, and, an, active, life, in, the, distinction, between, virtue, with, reluctation, and, virtue, secured, in, their, encounters, between, honesty, and, profit, in, their, balancing, of, virtue, with, virtue, and, the, like, so, as, this, part, deserveth, to, be, reported, for, excellently, laboured, (6), notwithstanding, if, before, they, had, come, to, the, popular, and, received, notions, of, virtue, and, vice, pleasure, and, pain, and, the, rest, they, had, stayed, a, little, longer, upon, the, inquiry, concerning, the, roots, of, good, and, evil, and, the, strings, of, those, roots, they, had, given, in, my, opinion, a, great, light, to, that, which, followed, and, specially, if, they, had, consulted, with, nature, they, had, made, their, doctrines, less, prolix, and, more, profound, which, being, by, them, in, part, omitted, and, in, part, handled, with, much, confusion, we, will, endeavour, to, resume, and, open, in, a, more, clear, manner, (7), there, is, formed, in, everything, a, double, nature, of, good—the, one, as, everything, is, a, total, or, substantive, in, itself, the, other, as, it, is, a, part, or, member, of, a, greater, body, whereof, the, latter, is, in, degree, the, greater, and, the, worthier, because, it, tendeth, to, the, conservation, of, a, more, general, form, therefore, we, see, the, iron, in, particular, sympathy, moveth, to, the, loadstone, but, yet, if, it, exceed, a, certain, quantity, it, forsaketh, the, affection, to, the, loadstone, and, like, a, good, patriot, moveth, to, the, earth, which, is, the, region, and, country, of, massy, bodies, so, may, we, go, forward, and, see, that, water, and, massy, bodies, move, to, the, centre, of, the, earth, but, rather, than, to, suffer, a, divulsion, in, the, continuance, of, nature, they, will, move, upwards, from, the, centre, of, the, earth, forsaking, their, duty, to, the, earth, in, regard, of, their, duty, to, the, world, this, double, nature, of, good, and, the, comparative, thereof, is, much, more, engraven, upon, man, if, he, degenerate, not, unto, whom, the, conservation, of, duty, to, the, public, ought, to, be, much, more, precious, than, the, conservation, of, life, and, being, according, to, that, memorable, speech, of, pompeius, magnus, when, being, in, commission, of, purveyance, for, a, famine, at, rome, and, being, dissuaded, with, great, vehemency, and, instance, by, his, friends, about, him, that, he, should, not, hazard, himself, to, sea, in, an, extremity, of, weather, he, said, only, to, them, _necesse, est, ut, eam_, _non, ut, vivam_, but, it, may, be, truly, affirmed, that, there, was, never, any, philosophy, religion, or, other, discipline, which, did, so, plainly, and, highly, exalt, the, good, which, is, communicative, and, depress, the, good, which, is, private, and, particular, as, the, holy, faith, well, declaring, that, it, was, the, same, god, that, gave, the, christian, law, to, men, who, gave, those, laws, of, nature, to, inanimate, creatures, that, we, spake, of, before, for, we, read, that, the, elected, saints, of, god, have, wished, themselves, anathematised, and, razed, out, of, the, book, of, life, in, an, ecstasy, of, charity, and, infinite, feeling, of, communion, (8), this, being, set, down, and, strongly, planted, doth, judge, and, determine, most, of, the, controversies, wherein, moral, philosophy, is, conversant, for, first, it, decideth, the, question, touching, the, preferment, of, the, contemplative, or, active, life, and, decideth, it, against, aristotle, for, all, the, reasons, which, he, bringeth, for, the, contemplative, are, private, and, respecting, the, pleasure, and, dignity, of, a, man’s, self, (in, which, respects, no, question, the, contemplative, life, hath, the, pre-eminence), not, much, unlike, to, that, comparison, which, pythagoras, made, for, the, gracing, and, magnifying, of, philosophy, and, contemplation, who, being, asked, what, he, was, answered, “that, if, hiero, were, ever, at, the, olympian, games, he, knew, the, manner, that, some, came, to, try, their, fortune, for, the, prizes, and, some, came, as, merchants, to, utter, their, commodities, and, some, came, to, make, good, cheer, and, meet, their, friends, and, some, came, to, look, on, and, that, he, was, one, of, them, that, came, to, look, on, ”, but, men, must, know, that, in, this, theatre, of, man’s, life, it, is, reserved, only, for, god, and, angels, to, be, lookers, on, neither, could, the, like, question, ever, have, been, received, in, the, church, notwithstanding, their, _pretiosa, in, oculis, domini, mors, sanctorum, ejus_, by, which, place, they, would, exalt, their, civil, death, and, regular, professions, but, upon, this, defence, that, the, monastical, life, is, not, simple, contemplative, but, performeth, the, duty, either, of, incessant, prayers, and, supplications, which, hath, been, truly, esteemed, as, an, office, in, the, church, or, else, of, writing, or, taking, instructions, for, writing, concerning, the, law, of, god, as, moses, did, when, he, abode, so, long, in, the, mount, and, so, we, see, enoch, the, seventh, from, adam, who, was, the, first, contemplative, and, walked, with, god, yet, did, also, endow, the, church, with, prophecy, which, saint, jude, citeth, but, for, contemplation, which, should, be, finished, in, itself, without, casting, beams, upon, society, assuredly, divinity, knoweth, it, not, (9), it, decideth, also, the, controversies, between, zeno, and, socrates, and, their, schools, and, successions, on, the, one, side, who, placed, felicity, in, virtue, simply, or, attended, the, actions, and, exercises, whereof, do, chiefly, embrace, and, concern, society, and, on, the, other, side, the, cyrenaics, and, epicureans, who, placed, it, in, pleasure, and, made, virtue, (as, it, is, used, in, some, comedies, of, errors, wherein, the, mistress, and, the, maid, change, habits), to, be, but, as, a, servant, without, which, pleasure, cannot, be, served, and, attended, and, the, reformed, school, of, the, epicureans, which, placed, it, in, serenity, of, mind, and, freedom, from, perturbation, as, if, they, would, have, deposed, jupiter, again, and, restored, saturn, and, the, first, age, when, there, was, no, summer, nor, winter, spring, nor, autumn, but, all, after, one, air, and, season, and, herillus, which, placed, felicity, in, extinguishment, of, the, disputes, of, the, mind, making, no, fixed, nature, of, good, and, evil, esteeming, things, according, to, the, clearness, of, the, desires, or, the, reluctation, which, opinion, was, revived, in, the, heresy, of, the, anabaptists, measuring, things, according, to, the, motions, of, the, spirit, and, the, constancy, or, wavering, of, belief, all, which, are, manifest, to, tend, to, private, repose, and, contentment, and, not, to, point, of, society, (10), it, censureth, also, the, philosophy, of, epictetus, which, presupposeth, that, felicity, must, be, placed, in, those, things, which, are, in, our, power, lest, we, be, liable, to, fortune, and, disturbance, as, if, it, were, not, a, thing, much, more, happy, to, fail, in, good, and, virtuous, ends, for, the, public, than, to, obtain, all, that, we, can, wish, to, ourselves, in, our, proper, fortune, as, consalvo, said, to, his, soldiers, showing, them, naples, and, protesting, he, had, rather, die, one, foot, forwards, than, to, have, his, life, secured, for, long, by, one, foot, of, retreat, whereunto, the, wisdom, of, that, heavenly, leader, hath, signed, who, hath, affirmed, that, “a, good, conscience, is, a, continual, feast, ”, showing, plainly, that, the, conscience, of, good, intentions, howsoever, succeeding, is, a, more, continual, joy, to, nature, than, all, the, provision, which, can, be, made, for, security, and, repose, (11), it, censureth, likewise, that, abuse, of, philosophy, which, grew, general, about, the, time, of, epictetus, in, converting, it, into, an, occupation, or, profession, as, if, the, purpose, had, been, not, to, resist, and, extinguish, perturbations, but, to, fly, and, avoid, the, causes, of, them, and, to, shape, a, particular, kind, and, course, of, life, to, that, end, introducing, such, a, health, of, mind, as, was, that, health, of, body, of, which, aristotle, speaketh, of, herodicus, who, did, nothing, all, his, life, long, but, intend, his, health, whereas, if, men, refer, themselves, to, duties, of, society, as, that, health, of, body, is, best, which, is, ablest, to, endure, all, alterations, and, extremities, so, likewise, that, health, of, mind, is, most, proper, which, can, go, through, the, greatest, temptations, and, perturbations, so, as, diogenes’, opinion, is, to, be, accepted, who, commended, not, them, which, abstained, but, them, which, sustained, and, could, refrain, their, mind, _in, præcipitio_, and, could, give, unto, the, mind, (as, is, used, in, horsemanship), the, shortest, stop, or, turn, (12), lastly, it, censureth, the, tenderness, and, want, of, application, in, some, of, the, most, ancient, and, reverend, philosophers, and, philosophical, men, that, did, retire, too, easily, from, civil, business, for, avoiding, of, indignities, and, perturbations, whereas, the, resolution, of, men, truly, moral, ought, to, be, such, as, the, same, consalvo, said, the, honour, of, a, soldier, should, be, _e, telâ, crassiore_, and, not, so, fine, as, that, everything, should, catch, in, it, and, endanger, it, (1), to, resume, private, or, particular, good, it, falleth, into, the, division, of, good, active, and, passive, for, this, difference, of, good, (not, unlike, to, that, which, amongst, the, romans, was, expressed, in, the, familiar, or, household, terms, of, _promus_, and, _condus_), is, formed, also, in, all, things, and, is, best, disclosed, in, the, two, several, appetites, in, creatures, the, one, to, preserve, or, continue, themselves, and, the, other, to, dilate, or, multiply, themselves, whereof, the, latter, seemeth, to, be, the, worthier, for, in, nature, the, heavens, which, are, the, more, worthy, are, the, agent, and, the, earth, which, is, the, less, worthy, is, the, patient, in, the, pleasures, of, living, creatures, that, of, generation, is, greater, than, that, of, food, in, divine, doctrine, _beatius, est, dare, quam, accipere_, and, in, life, there, is, no, man’s, spirit, so, soft, but, esteemeth, the, effecting, of, somewhat, that, he, hath, fixed, in, his, desire, more, than, sensuality, which, priority, of, the, active, good, is, much, upheld, by, the, consideration, of, our, estate, to, be, mortal, and, exposed, to, fortune, for, if, we, might, have, a, perpetuity, and, certainty, in, our, pleasures, the, state, of, them, would, advance, their, price, but, when, we, see, it, is, but, _magni, æstimamus, mori, tardius_, and, _ne, glorieris, de, crastino_, _nescis, partum, diei_, it, maketh, us, to, desire, to, have, somewhat, secured, and, exempted, from, time, which, are, only, our, deeds, and, works, as, it, is, said, _opera, eorum, sequuntur, eos_, the, pre-eminence, likewise, of, this, active, good, is, upheld, by, the, affection, which, is, natural, in, man, towards, variety, and, proceeding, which, in, the, pleasures, of, the, sense, which, is, the, principal, part, of, passive, good, can, have, no, great, latitude, _cogita, quamdiu, eadem, feceris_, _cibus_, _somnus_, _ludus, per, hunc, circulum, curritur_, _mori, velle, non, tantum, fortis_, _aut, miser_, _aut, prudens_, _sed, etiam, fastidiosus, potest_, but, in, enterprises, pursuits, and, purposes, of, life, there, is, much, variety, whereof, men, are, sensible, with, pleasure, in, their, inceptions, progressions, recoils, reintegrations, approaches, and, attainings, to, their, ends, so, as, it, was, well, said, _vita, sine, proposito, languida, et, vaga, est_, neither, hath, this, active, good, an, identity, with, the, good, of, society, though, in, some, cases, it, hath, an, incidence, into, it, for, although, it, do, many, times, bring, forth, acts, of, beneficence, yet, it, is, with, a, respect, private, to, a, man’s, own, power, glory, amplification, continuance, as, appeareth, plainly, when, it, findeth, a, contrary, subject, for, that, gigantine, state, of, mind, which, possesseth, the, troublers, of, the, world, such, as, was, lucius, sylla, and, infinite, other, in, smaller, model, who, would, have, all, men, happy, or, unhappy, as, they, were, their, friends, or, enemies, and, would, give, form, to, the, world, according, to, their, own, humours, (which, is, the, true, theomachy), pretendeth, and, aspireth, to, active, good, though, it, recedeth, furthest, from, good, of, society, which, we, have, determined, to, be, the, greater, (2), to, resume, passive, good, it, receiveth, a, subdivision, of, conservative, and, effective, for, let, us, take, a, brief, review, of, that, which, we, have, said, we, have, spoken, first, of, the, good, of, society, the, intention, whereof, embraceth, the, form, of, human, nature, whereof, we, are, members, and, portions, and, not, our, own, proper, and, individual, form, we, have, spoken, of, active, good, and, supposed, it, as, a, part, of, private, and, particular, good, and, rightly, for, there, is, impressed, upon, all, things, a, triple, desire, or, appetite, proceeding, from, love, to, themselves, one, of, preserving, and, continuing, their, form, another, of, advancing, and, perfecting, their, form, and, a, third, of, multiplying, and, extending, their, form, upon, other, things, whereof, the, multiplying, or, signature, of, it, upon, other, things, is, that, which, we, handled, by, the, name, of, active, good, so, as, there, remaineth, the, conserving, of, it, and, perfecting, or, raising, of, it, which, latter, is, the, highest, degree, of, passive, good, for, to, preserve, in, state, is, the, less, to, preserve, with, advancement, is, the, greater, so, in, man, “igneus, est, ollis, vigor, et, cælestis, origo, ”, his, approach, or, assumption, to, divine, or, angelical, nature, is, the, perfection, of, his, form, the, error, or, false, imitation, of, which, good, is, that, which, is, the, tempest, of, human, life, while, man, upon, the, instinct, of, an, advancement, formal, and, essential, is, carried, to, seek, an, advancement, local, for, as, those, which, are, sick, and, find, no, remedy, do, tumble, up, and, down, and, change, place, as, if, by, a, remove, local, they, could, obtain, a, remove, internal, so, is, it, with, men, in, ambition, when, failing, of, the, mean, to, exalt, their, nature, they, are, in, a, perpetual, estuation, to, exalt, their, place, so, then, passive, good, is, as, was, said, either, conservative, or, perfective, (3), to, resume, the, good, of, conservation, or, comfort, which, consisteth, in, the, fruition, of, that, which, is, agreeable, to, our, natures, it, seemeth, to, be, most, pure, and, natural, of, pleasures, but, yet, the, softest, and, lowest, and, this, also, receiveth, a, difference, which, hath, neither, been, well, judged, of, nor, well, inquired, for, the, good, of, fruition, or, contentment, is, placed, either, in, the, sincereness, of, the, fruition, or, in, the, quickness, and, vigour, of, it, the, one, superinduced, by, equality, the, other, by, vicissitude, the, one, having, less, mixture, of, evil, the, other, more, impression, of, good, whether, of, these, is, the, greater, good, is, a, question, controverted, but, whether, man’s, nature, may, not, be, capable, of, both, is, a, question, not, inquired, (4), the, former, question, being, debated, between, socrates, and, a, sophist, socrates, placing, felicity, in, an, equal, and, constant, peace, of, mind, and, the, sophist, in, much, desiring, and, much, enjoying, they, fell, from, argument, to, ill, words, the, sophist, saying, that, socrates’, felicity, was, the, felicity, of, a, block, or, stone, and, socrates, saying, that, the, sophist’s, felicity, was, the, felicity, of, one, that, had, the, itch, who, did, nothing, but, itch, and, scratch, and, both, these, opinions, do, not, want, their, supports, for, the, opinion, of, socrates, is, much, upheld, by, the, general, consent, even, of, the, epicures, themselves, that, virtue, beareth, a, great, part, in, felicity, and, if, so, certain, it, is, that, virtue, hath, more, use, in, clearing, perturbations, then, in, compassing, desires, the, sophist’s, opinion, is, much, favoured, by, the, assertion, we, last, spake, of, that, good, of, advancement, is, greater, than, good, of, simple, preservation, because, every, obtaining, a, desire, hath, a, show, of, advancement, as, motion, though, in, a, circle, hath, a, show, of, progression, (5), but, the, second, question, decided, the, true, way, maketh, the, former, superfluous, for, can, it, be, doubted, but, that, there, are, some, who, take, more, pleasure, in, enjoying, pleasures, than, some, other, and, yet, nevertheless, are, less, troubled, with, the, loss, or, leaving, of, them, so, as, this, same, _non, uti, ut, non, appetas_, _non, appetere, ut, non, metuas_, _sunt, animi, pusilli, et, diffidentis_, and, it, seemeth, to, me, that, most, of, the, doctrines, of, the, philosophers, are, more, fearful, and, cautious, than, the, nature, of, things, requireth, so, have, they, increased, the, fear, of, death, in, offering, to, cure, it, for, when, they, would, have, a, man’s, whole, life, to, be, but, a, discipline, or, preparation, to, die, they, must, needs, make, men, think, that, it, is, a, terrible, enemy, against, whom, there, is, no, end, of, preparing, better, saith, the, poet, —, “qui, finem, vitæ, extremum, inter, munera, ponat, naturæ, ”, so, have, they, sought, to, make, men’s, minds, too, uniform, and, harmonical, by, not, breaking, them, sufficiently, to, contrary, motions, the, reasons, whereof, suppose, to, be, because, they, themselves, were, men, dedicated, to, a, private, free, and, unapplied, course, of, life, for, as, we, see, upon, the, lute, or, like, instrument, a, ground, though, it, be, sweet, and, have, show, of, many, changes, yet, breaketh, not, the, hand, to, such, strange, and, hard, stops, and, passages, as, a, set, song, or, voluntary, much, after, the, same, manner, was, the, diversity, between, a, philosophical, and, civil, life, and, therefore, men, are, to, imitate, the, wisdom, of, jewellers, who, if, there, be, a, grain, or, a, cloud, or, an, ice, which, may, be, ground, forth, without, taking, too, much, of, the, stone, they, help, it, but, if, it, should, lessen, and, abate, the, stone, too, much, they, will, not, meddle, with, it, so, ought, men, so, to, procure, serenity, as, they, destroy, not, magnanimity, (6), having, therefore, deduced, the, good, of, man, which, is, private, and, particular, as, far, as, seemeth, fit, we, will, now, return, to, that, good, of, man, which, respecteth, and, beholdeth, society, which, we, may, term, duty, because, the, term, of, duty, is, more, proper, to, a, mind, well, framed, and, disposed, towards, others, as, the, term, of, virtue, is, applied, to, a, mind, well, formed, and, composed, in, itself, though, neither, can, a, man, understand, virtue, without, some, relation, to, society, nor, duty, without, an, inward, disposition, this, part, may, seem, at, first, to, pertain, to, science, civil, and, politic, but, not, if, it, be, well, observed, for, it, concerneth, the, regiment, and, government, of, every, man, over, himself, and, not, over, others, and, as, in, architecture, the, direction, of, framing, the, posts, beams, and, other, parts, of, building, is, not, the, same, with, the, manner, of, joining, them, and, erecting, the, building, and, in, mechanicals, the, direction, how, to, frame, an, instrument, or, engine, is, not, the, same, with, the, manner, of, setting, it, on, work, and, employing, it, and, yet, nevertheless, in, expressing, of, the, one, you, incidently, express, the, aptness, towards, the, other, so, the, doctrine, of, conjugation, of, men, in, society, differeth, from, that, of, their, conformity, thereunto, (7), this, part, of, duty, is, subdivided, into, two, parts, the, common, duty, of, every, man, as, a, man, or, member, of, a, state, the, other, the, respective, or, special, duty, of, every, man, in, his, profession, vocation, and, place, the, first, of, these, is, extant, and, well, laboured, as, hath, been, said, the, second, likewise, may, report, rather, dispersed, than, deficient, which, manner, of, dispersed, writing, in, this, kind, of, argument, acknowledge, to, be, best, for, who, can, take, upon, him, to, write, of, the, proper, duty, virtue, challenge, and, right, of, every, several, vocation, profession, and, place, for, although, sometimes, a, looker, on, may, see, more, than, a, gamester, and, there, be, a, proverb, more, arrogant, than, sound, “that, the, vale, best, discovereth, the, hill, ”, yet, there, is, small, doubt, but, that, men, can, write, best, and, most, really, and, materially, in, their, own, professions, and, that, the, writing, of, speculative, men, of, active, matter, for, the, most, part, doth, seem, to, men, of, experience, as, phormio’s, argument, of, the, wars, seemed, to, hannibal, to, be, but, dreams, and, dotage, only, there, is, one, vice, which, accompanieth, them, that, write, in, their, own, professions, that, they, magnify, them, in, excess, but, generally, it, were, to, be, wished, (as, that, which, would, make, learning, indeed, solid, and, fruitful), that, active, men, would, or, could, become, writers, (8), in, which, kind, cannot, but, mention, _honoris, causa_, your, majesty’s, excellent, book, touching, the, duty, of, a, king, a, work, richly, compounded, of, divinity, morality, and, policy, with, great, aspersion, of, all, other, arts, and, being, in, some, opinion, one, of, the, most, sound, and, healthful, writings, that, have, read, not, distempered, in, the, heat, of, invention, nor, in, the, coldness, of, negligence, not, sick, of, dizziness, as, those, are, who, leese, themselves, in, their, order, nor, of, convulsions, as, those, which, cramp, in, matters, impertinent, not, savouring, of, perfumes, and, paintings, as, those, do, who, seek, to, please, the, reader, more, than, nature, beareth, and, chiefly, well, disposed, in, the, spirits, thereof, being, agreeable, to, truth, and, apt, for, action, and, far, removed, from, that, natural, infirmity, whereunto, noted, those, that, write, in, their, own, professions, to, be, subject—which, is, that, they, exalt, it, above, measure, for, your, majesty, hath, truly, described, not, a, king, of, assyria, or, persia, in, their, extern, glory, but, a, moses, or, a, david, pastors, of, their, people, neither, can, ever, leese, out, of, my, remembrance, what, heard, your, majesty, in, the, same, sacred, spirit, of, government, deliver, in, a, great, cause, of, judicature, which, was, “that, kings, ruled, by, their, laws, as, god, did, by, the, laws, of, nature, and, ought, as, rarely, to, put, in, use, their, supreme, prerogative, as, god, doth, his, power, of, working, miracles, ”, and, yet, notwithstanding, in, your, book, of, a, free, monarchy, you, do, well, give, men, to, understand, that, you, know, the, plenitude, of, the, power, and, right, of, a, king, as, well, as, the, circle, of, his, office, and, duty, thus, have, presumed, to, allege, this, excellent, writing, of, your, majesty, as, a, prime, or, eminent, example, of, tractates, concerning, special, and, respective, duties, wherein, should, have, said, as, much, if, it, had, been, written, a, thousand, years, since, neither, am, moved, with, certain, courtly, decencies, which, esteem, it, flattery, to, praise, in, presence, no, it, is, flattery, to, praise, in, absence—that, is, when, either, the, virtue, is, absent, or, the, occasion, is, absent, and, so, the, praise, is, not, natural, but, forced, either, in, truth, or, in, time, but, let, cicero, be, read, in, his, oration, _pro, marcello_, which, is, nothing, but, an, excellent, table, of, cæsar’s, virtue, and, made, to, his, face, besides, the, example, of, many, other, excellent, persons, wiser, a, great, deal, than, such, observers, and, we, will, never, doubt, upon, a, full, occasion, to, give, just, praises, to, present, or, absent, (9), but, to, return, there, belongeth, further, to, the, handling, of, this, part, touching, the, duties, of, professions, and, vocations, a, relative, or, opposite, touching, the, frauds, cautels, impostures, and, vices, of, every, profession, which, hath, been, likewise, handled, but, how, rather, in, a, satire, and, cynically, than, seriously, and, wisely, for, men, have, rather, sought, by, wit, to, deride, and, traduce, much, of, that, which, is, good, in, professions, than, with, judgment, to, discover, and, sever, that, which, is, corrupt, for, as, solomon, saith, he, that, cometh, to, seek, after, knowledge, with, a, mind, to, scorn, and, censure, shall, be, sure, to, find, matter, for, his, humour, but, no, matter, for, his, instruction, _quærenti, derisori, scientiam, ipsa, se, abscondit_, _sed, studioso, fit, obviam_, but, the, managing, of, this, argument, with, integrity, and, truth, which, note, as, deficient, seemeth, to, me, to, be, one, of, the, best, fortifications, for, honesty, and, virtue, that, can, be, planted, for, as, the, fable, goeth, of, the, basilisk—that, if, he, see, you, first, you, die, for, it, but, if, you, see, him, first, he, dieth—so, is, it, with, deceits, and, evil, arts, which, if, they, be, first, espied, they, leese, their, life, but, if, they, prevent, they, endanger, so, that, we, are, much, beholden, to, machiavel, and, others, that, write, what, men, do, and, not, what, they, ought, to, do, for, it, is, not, possible, to, join, serpentine, wisdom, with, the, columbine, innocency, except, men, know, exactly, all, the, conditions, of, the, serpent, his, baseness, and, going, upon, his, belly, his, volubility, and, lubricity, his, envy, and, sting, and, the, rest—that, is, all, forms, and, natures, of, evil, for, without, this, virtue, lieth, open, and, unfenced, nay, an, honest, man, can, do, no, good, upon, those, that, are, wicked, to, reclaim, them, without, the, help, of, the, knowledge, of, evil, for, men, of, corrupted, minds, presuppose, that, honesty, groweth, out, of, simplicity, of, manners, and, believing, of, preachers, schoolmasters, and, men’s, exterior, language, so, as, except, you, can, make, them, perceive, that, you, know, the, utmost, reaches, of, their, own, corrupt, opinions, they, despise, all, morality, _non, recipit, stultus, verba, prudentiæ_, _nisi, ea, dixeris, quæ_, _versantur, in, corde, ejus_, (10), unto, this, part, touching, respective, duty, doth, also, appertain, the, duties, between, husband, and, wife, parent, and, child, master, and, servant, so, likewise, the, laws, of, friendship, and, gratitude, the, civil, bond, of, companies, colleges, and, politic, bodies, of, neighbourhood, and, all, other, proportionate, duties, not, as, they, are, parts, of, government, and, society, but, as, to, the, framing, of, the, mind, of, particular, persons, (11), the, knowledge, concerning, good, respecting, society, doth, handle, it, also, not, simply, alone, but, comparatively, whereunto, belongeth, the, weighing, of, duties, between, person, and, person, case, and, case, particular, and, public, as, we, see, in, the, proceeding, of, lucius, brutus, against, his, own, sons, which, was, so, much, extolled, yet, what, was, said, “infelix, utcunque, ferent, ea, fata, minores, ”, so, the, case, was, doubtful, and, had, opinion, on, both, sides, again, we, see, when, brutus, and, cassius, invited, to, a, supper, certain, whose, opinions, they, meant, to, feel, whether, they, were, fit, to, be, made, their, associates, and, cast, forth, the, question, touching, the, killing, of, a, tyrant, being, a, usurper, they, were, divided, in, opinion, some, holding, that, servitude, was, the, extreme, of, evils, and, others, that, tyranny, was, better, than, a, civil, war, and, a, number, of, the, like, cases, there, are, of, comparative, duty, amongst, which, that, of, all, others, is, the, most, frequent, where, the, question, is, of, a, great, deal, of, good, to, ensue, of, a, small, injustice, which, jason, of, thessalia, determined, against, the, truth, _aliqua, sunt, injuste, facienda_, _ut, multa, juste, fieri, possint_, but, the, reply, is, good, _auctorem, præsentis, justitiæ, habes_, _sponsorem, futuræ, non, habes_, men, must, pursue, things, which, are, just, in, present, and, leave, the, future, to, the, divine, providence, so, then, we, pass, on, from, this, general, part, touching, the, exemplar, and, description, of, good, (1), now, therefore, that, we, have, spoken, of, this, fruit, of, life, it, remaineth, to, speak, of, the, husbandry, that, belongeth, thereunto, without, which, part, the, former, seemeth, to, be, no, better, than, a, fair, image, or, statue, which, is, beautiful, to, contemplate, but, is, without, life, and, motion, whereunto, aristotle, himself, subscribeth, in, these, words, _necesse, est, scilicet, de, virtute, dicere_, _et, quid, sit_, _et, ex, quibus, gignatur_, _inutile, enum, fere, fuerit, virtutem, quidem, nosse_, _acquirendæ, autem, ejus, modos, et, vias, ignorare_, _non, enum, de, virtute, tantum_, _qua, specie, sit_, _quærendum, est_, _sed, et, quomodo, sui, copiam, faciat_, _utrumque, enum, volumeus_, _et, rem, ipsam, nosse_, _et, ejus, compotes, fieri_, _hoc, autem, ex, voto, non, succedet_, _nisi, sciamus, et, ex, quibus, et, quomodo_, in, such, full, words, and, with, such, iteration, doth, he, inculcate, this, part, so, saith, cicero, in, great, commendation, of, cato, the, second, that, he, had, applied, himself, to, philosophy, _non, ita, disputandi, causa_, _sed, ita, vivendi_, and, although, the, neglect, of, our, times, wherein, few, men, do, hold, any, consultations, touching, the, reformation, of, their, life, (as, seneca, excellently, saith, _de, partibus, vitæ, quisque, deliberat_, _de, summa, nemo_), may, make, this, part, seem, superfluous, yet, must, conclude, with, that, aphorism, of, hippocrates, _qui, gravi, morbo, correpti, dolores, non, sentiunt_, _iis, mens, ægrotat_, they, need, medicine, not, only, to, assuage, the, disease, but, to, awake, the, sense, and, if, it, be, said, that, the, cure, of, men’s, minds, belongeth, to, sacred, divinity, it, is, most, true, but, yet, moral, philosophy, may, be, preferred, unto, her, as, a, wise, servant, and, humble, handmaid, for, as, the, psalm, saith, “that, the, eyes, of, the, handmaid, look, perpetually, towards, the, mistress, ”, and, yet, no, doubt, many, things, are, left, to, the, discretion, of, the, handmaid, to, discern, of, the, mistress’, will, so, ought, moral, philosophy, to, give, a, constant, attention, to, the, doctrines, of, divinity, and, yet, so, as, it, may, yield, of, herself, (within, due, limits), many, sound, and, profitable, directions, (2), this, part, therefore, because, of, the, excellency, thereof, cannot, but, find, exceeding, strange, that, it, is, not, reduced, to, written, inquiry, the, rather, because, it, consisteth, of, much, matter, wherein, both, speech, and, action, is, often, conversant, and, such, wherein, the, common, talk, of, men, (which, is, rare, but, yet, cometh, sometimes, to, pass), is, wiser, than, their, books, it, is, reasonable, therefore, that, we, propound, it, in, the, more, particularity, both, for, the, worthiness, and, because, we, may, acquit, ourselves, for, reporting, it, deficient, which, seemeth, almost, incredible, and, is, otherwise, conceived, and, presupposed, by, those, themselves, that, have, written, we, will, therefore, enumerate, some, heads, or, points, thereof, that, it, may, appear, the, better, what, it, is, and, whether, it, be, extant, (3), first, therefore, in, this, as, in, all, things, which, are, practical, we, ought, to, cast, up, our, account, what, is, in, our, power, and, what, not, for, the, one, may, be, dealt, with, by, way, of, alteration, but, the, other, by, way, of, application, only, the, husbandman, cannot, command, neither, the, nature, of, the, earth, nor, the, seasons, of, the, weather, no, more, can, the, physician, the, constitution, of, the, patient, nor, the, variety, of, accidents, so, in, the, culture, and, cure, of, the, mind, of, man, two, things, are, without, our, command, points, of, nature, and, points, of, fortune, for, to, the, basis, of, the, one, and, the, conditions, of, the, other, our, work, is, limited, and, tied, in, these, things, therefore, it, is, left, unto, us, to, proceed, by, application, —, “vincenda, est, omnis, fertuna, ferendo, ”, and, so, likewise, “vincenda, est, omnis, natura, ferendo, ”, but, when, that, we, speak, of, suffering, we, do, not, speak, of, a, dull, and, neglected, suffering, but, of, a, wise, and, industrious, suffering, which, draweth, and, contriveth, use, and, advantage, out, of, that, which, seemeth, adverse, and, contrary, which, is, that, properly, which, we, call, accommodating, or, applying, now, the, wisdom, of, application, resteth, principally, in, the, exact, and, distinct, knowledge, of, the, precedent, state, or, disposition, unto, which, we, do, apply, for, we, cannot, fit, a, garment, except, we, first, take, measure, of, the, body, (4), so, then, the, first, article, of, this, knowledge, is, to, set, down, sound, and, true, distributions, and, descriptions, of, the, several, characters, and, tempers, of, men’s, natures, and, dispositions, specially, having, regard, to, those, differences, which, are, most, radical, in, being, the, fountains, and, causes, of, the, rest, or, most, frequent, in, concurrence, or, commixture, wherein, it, is, not, the, handling, of, a, few, of, them, in, passage, the, better, to, describe, the, mediocrities, of, virtues, that, can, satisfy, this, intention, for, if, it, deserve, to, be, considered, that, there, are, minds, which, are, proportioned, to, great, matters, and, others, to, small, (which, aristotle, handleth, or, ought, to, have, bandied, by, the, name, of, magnanimity), doth, it, not, deserve, as, well, to, be, considered, that, there, are, minds, proportioned, to, intend, many, matters, and, others, to, few, so, that, some, can, divide, themselves, others, can, perchance, do, exactly, well, but, it, must, be, but, in, few, things, at, once, and, so, there, cometh, to, be, a, narrowness, of, mind, as, well, as, a, pusillanimity, and, again, that, some, minds, are, proportioned, to, that, which, may, be, dispatched, at, once, or, within, a, short, return, of, time, others, to, that, which, begins, afar, off, and, is, to, be, won, with, length, of, pursuit, —, “jam, tum, tenditqus, fovetque, ”, so, that, there, may, be, fitly, said, to, be, a, longanimity, which, is, commonly, also, ascribed, to, god, as, a, magnanimity, so, further, deserved, it, to, be, considered, by, aristotle, “that, there, is, a, disposition, in, conversation, (supposing, it, in, things, which, do, in, no, sort, touch, or, concern, a, man’s, self), to, soothe, and, please, and, a, disposition, contrary, to, contradict, and, cross, ”, and, deserveth, it, not, much, better, to, be, considered, “that, there, is, a, disposition, not, in, conversation, or, talk, but, in, matter, of, more, serious, nature, (and, supposing, it, still, in, things, merely, indifferent), to, take, pleasure, in, the, good, of, another, and, a, disposition, contrariwise, to, take, distaste, at, the, good, of, another, ”, which, is, that, properly, which, we, call, good, nature, or, ill, nature, benignity, or, malignity, and, therefore, cannot, sufficiently, marvel, that, this, part, of, knowledge, touching, the, several, characters, of, natures, and, dispositions, should, be, omitted, both, in, morality, and, policy, considering, it, is, of, so, great, ministry, and, suppeditation, to, them, both, man, shall, find, in, the, traditions, of, astrology, some, pretty, and, apt, divisions, of, men’s, natures, according, to, the, predominances, of, the, planets, lovers, of, quiet, lovers, of, action, lovers, of, victory, lovers, of, honour, lovers, of, pleasure, lovers, of, arts, lovers, of, change, and, so, forth, man, shall, find, in, the, wisest, sort, of, these, relations, which, the, italians, make, touching, conclaves, the, natures, of, the, several, cardinals, handsomely, and, lively, painted, forth, man, shall, meet, with, in, every, day’s, conference, the, denominations, of, sensitive, dry, formal, real, humorous, certain, _huomo, di, prima, impressione_, _huomo, di, ultima, impressione_, and, the, like, and, yet, nevertheless, this, kind, of, observations, wandereth, in, words, but, is, not, fixed, in, inquiry, for, the, distinctions, are, found, (many, of, them), but, we, conclude, no, precepts, upon, them, wherein, our, fault, is, the, greater, because, both, history, poesy, and, daily, experience, are, as, goodly, fields, where, these, observations, grow, whereof, we, make, a, few, posies, to, hold, in, our, hands, but, no, man, bringeth, them, to, the, confectionary, that, receipts, might, be, made, of, them, for, use, of, life, (5), of, much, like, kind, are, those, impressions, of, nature, which, are, imposed, upon, the, mind, by, the, sex, by, the, age, by, the, region, by, health, and, sickness, by, beauty, and, deformity, and, the, like, which, are, inherent, and, not, extern, and, again, those, which, are, caused, by, extern, fortune, as, sovereignty, nobility, obscure, birth, riches, want, magistracy, privateness, prosperity, adversity, constant, fortune, variable, fortune, rising, _per, saltum_, _per, gradus_, and, the, like, and, therefore, we, see, that, plautus, maketh, it, a, wonder, to, see, an, old, man, beneficent, _benignitas, hujis, ut, adolescentuli, est_, saint, paul, concludeth, that, severity, of, discipline, was, to, be, used, to, the, cretans, _increpa, eos, dure_, upon, the, disposition, of, their, country, _cretensus, semper, mendaces_, _malæ, bestiæ_, _ventres_, sallust, noteth, that, it, is, usual, with, kings, to, desire, contradictories, _sed, plerumque, regiæ, voluntates_, _ut, vehementes, sunt_, _sic, mobiles_, _sæpeque, ipsæ, sibi, advers_, tacitus, observeth, how, rarely, raising, of, the, fortune, mendeth, the, disposition, _solus, vespasianus, mutatus, in, melius_, pindarus, maketh, an, observation, that, great, and, sudden, fortune, for, the, most, part, defeateth, men, _qui, magnam, felicitatem, concoquere, non, possunt_, so, the, psalm, showeth, it, is, more, easy, to, keep, a, measure, in, the, enjoying, of, fortune, than, in, the, increase, of, fortune, _divitiæ, si, affluant_, _nolite, cor, apponere_, these, observations, and, the, like, deny, not, but, are, touched, a, little, by, aristotle, as, in, passage, in, his, rhetorics, and, are, handled, in, some, scattered, discourses, but, they, were, never, incorporate, into, moral, philosophy, to, which, they, do, essentially, appertain, as, the, knowledge, of, this, diversity, of, grounds, and, moulds, doth, to, agriculture, and, the, knowledge, of, the, diversity, of, complexions, and, constitutions, doth, to, the, physician, except, we, mean, to, follow, the, indiscretion, of, empirics, which, minister, the, same, medicines, to, all, patients, (6), another, article, of, this, knowledge, is, the, inquiry, touching, the, affections, for, as, in, medicining, of, the, body, it, is, in, order, first, to, know, the, divers, complexions, and, constitutions, secondly, the, diseases, and, lastly, the, cures, so, in, medicining, of, the, mind, after, knowledge, of, the, divers, characters, of, men’s, natures, it, followeth, in, order, to, know, the, diseases, and, infirmities, of, the, mind, which, are, no, other, than, the, perturbations, and, distempars, of, the, affections, for, as, the, ancient, politiques, in, popular, estates, were, wont, to, compare, the, people, to, the, sea, and, the, orators, to, the, winds, because, as, the, sea, would, of, itself, be, calm, and, quiet, if, the, winds, did, not, move, and, trouble, it, so, the, people, would, be, peaceable, and, tractable, if, the, seditious, orators, did, not, set, them, in, working, and, agitation, so, it, may, be, fitly, said, that, the, mind, in, the, nature, thereof, would, be, temperate, and, stayed, if, the, affections, as, winds, did, not, put, it, into, tumult, and, perturbation, and, here, again, find, strange, as, before, that, aristotle, should, have, written, divers, volumes, of, ethics, and, never, handled, the, affections, which, is, the, principal, subject, thereof, and, yet, in, his, rhetorics, where, they, are, considered, but, collaterally, and, in, a, second, degree, (as, they, may, be, moved, by, speech), he, findeth, place, for, them, and, handleth, them, well, for, the, quantity, but, where, their, true, place, is, he, pretermitteth, them, for, it, is, not, his, disputations, about, pleasure, and, pain, that, can, satisfy, this, inquiry, no, more, than, he, that, should, generally, handle, the, nature, of, light, can, be, said, to, handle, the, nature, of, colours, for, pleasure, and, pain, are, to, the, particular, affections, as, light, is, to, particular, colours, better, travails, suppose, had, the, stoics, taken, in, this, argument, as, far, as, can, gather, by, that, which, we, have, at, second, hand, but, yet, it, is, like, it, was, after, their, manner, rather, in, subtlety, of, definitions, (which, in, a, subject, of, this, nature, are, but, curiosities), than, in, active, and, ample, descriptions, and, observations, so, likewise, find, some, particular, writings, of, an, elegant, nature, touching, some, of, the, affections, as, of, anger, of, comfort, upon, adverse, accidents, of, tenderness, of, countenance, and, other, but, the, poets, and, writers, of, histories, are, the, best, doctors, of, this, knowledge, where, we, may, find, painted, forth, with, great, life, how, affections, are, kindled, and, incited, and, how, pacified, and, refrained, and, how, again, contained, from, act, and, further, degree, how, they, disclose, themselves, how, they, work, how, they, vary, how, they, gather, and, fortify, how, they, are, enwrapped, one, within, another, and, how, they, do, fight, and, encounter, one, with, another, and, other, the, like, particularities, amongst, the, which, this, last, is, of, special, use, in, moral, and, civil, matters, how, say, to, set, affection, against, affection, and, to, master, one, by, another, even, as, we, used, to, hunt, beast, with, beast, and, fly, bird, with, bird, which, otherwise, percase, we, could, not, so, easily, recover, upon, which, foundation, is, erected, that, excellent, use, of, _præmium_, and, _pæna_, whereby, civil, states, consist, employing, the, predominant, affections, of, fear, and, hope, for, the, suppressing, and, bridling, the, rest, for, as, in, the, government, of, states, it, is, sometimes, necessary, to, bridle, one, faction, with, another, so, it, is, in, the, government, within, (7), now, come, we, to, those, points, which, are, within, our, own, command, and, have, force, and, operation, upon, the, mind, to, affect, the, will, and, appetite, and, to, alter, manners, wherein, they, ought, to, have, handled, custom, exercise, habit, education, example, imitation, emulation, company, friends, praise, reproof, exhortation, fame, laws, books, studies, these, as, they, have, determinate, use, in, moralities, from, these, the, mind, suffereth, and, of, these, are, such, receipts, and, regiments, compounded, and, described, as, may, serve, to, recover, or, preserve, the, health, and, good, estate, of, the, mind, as, far, as, pertaineth, to, human, medicine, of, which, number, we, will, insist, upon, some, one, or, two, as, an, example, of, the, rest, because, it, were, too, long, to, prosecute, all, and, therefore, we, do, resume, custom, and, habit, to, speak, of, (8), the, opinion, of, aristotle, seemeth, to, me, a, negligent, opinion, that, of, those, things, which, consist, by, nature, nothing, can, be, changed, by, custom, using, for, example, that, if, a, stone, be, thrown, ten, thousand, times, up, it, will, not, learn, to, ascend, and, that, by, often, seeing, or, hearing, we, do, not, learn, to, see, or, hear, the, better, for, though, this, principle, be, true, in, things, wherein, nature, is, peremptory, (the, reason, whereof, we, cannot, now, stand, to, discuss), yet, it, is, otherwise, in, things, wherein, nature, admitteth, a, latitude, for, he, might, see, that, a, strait, glove, will, come, more, easily, on, with, use, and, that, a, wand, will, by, use, bend, otherwise, than, it, grew, and, that, by, use, of, the, voice, we, speak, louder, and, stronger, and, that, by, use, of, enduring, heat, or, cold, we, endure, it, the, better, and, the, like, which, latter, sort, have, a, nearer, resemblance, unto, that, subject, of, manners, he, handleth, than, those, instances, which, he, allegeth, but, allowing, his, conclusion, that, virtues, and, vices, consist, in, habit, he, ought, so, much, the, more, to, have, taught, the, manner, of, superinducing, that, habit, for, there, be, many, precepts, of, the, wise, ordering, the, exercises, of, the, mind, as, there, is, of, ordering, the, exercises, of, the, body, whereof, we, will, recite, a, few, (9), the, first, shall, be, that, we, beware, we, take, not, at, the, first, either, too, high, a, strain, or, too, weak, for, if, too, high, in, a, diffident, nature, you, discourage, in, a, confident, nature, you, breed, an, opinion, of, facility, and, so, a, sloth, and, in, all, natures, you, breed, a, further, expectation, than, can, hold, out, and, so, an, insatisfaction, in, the, end, if, too, weak, of, the, other, side, you, may, not, look, to, perform, and, overcome, any, great, task, (10), another, precept, is, to, practise, all, things, chiefly, at, two, several, times, the, one, when, the, mind, is, best, disposed, the, other, when, it, is, worst, disposed, that, by, the, one, you, may, gain, a, great, step, by, the, other, you, may, work, out, the, knots, and, stonds, of, the, mind, and, make, the, middle, times, the, more, easy, and, pleasant, (11), another, precept, is, that, which, aristotle, mentioneth, by, the, way, which, is, to, bear, ever, towards, the, contrary, extreme, of, that, whereunto, we, are, by, nature, inclined, like, unto, the, rowing, against, the, stream, or, making, a, wand, straight, by, bending, him, contrary, to, his, natural, crookedness, (12), another, precept, is, that, the, mind, is, brought, to, anything, better, and, with, more, sweetness, and, happiness, if, that, whereunto, you, pretend, be, not, first, in, the, intention, but, _tanquam, aliud, agendo_, because, of, the, natural, hatred, of, the, mind, against, necessity, and, constraint, many, other, axioms, there, are, touching, the, managing, of, exercise, and, custom, which, being, so, conducted, doth, prove, indeed, another, nature, but, being, governed, by, chance, doth, commonly, prove, but, an, ape, of, nature, and, bringeth, forth, that, which, is, lame, and, counterfeit, (13), so, if, we, should, handle, books, and, studies, and, what, influence, and, operation, they, have, upon, manners, are, there, not, divers, precepts, of, great, caution, and, direction, appertaining, thereunto, did, not, one, of, the, fathers, in, great, indignation, call, poesy, _vinum, dæmonum_, because, it, increaseth, temptations, perturbations, and, vain, opinions, is, not, the, opinion, of, aristotle, worthy, to, be, regarded, wherein, he, saith, “that, young, men, are, no, fit, auditors, of, moral, philosophy, because, they, are, not, settled, from, the, boiling, heat, of, their, affections, nor, attempered, with, time, and, experience”, and, doth, it, not, hereof, come, that, those, excellent, books, and, discourses, of, the, ancient, writers, (whereby, they, have, persuaded, unto, virtue, most, effectually, by, representing, her, in, state, and, majesty, and, popular, opinions, against, virtue, in, their, parasites’, coats, fit, to, be, scorned, and, derided), are, of, so, little, effect, towards, honesty, of, life, because, they, are, not, read, and, revolved, by, men, in, their, mature, and, settled, years, but, confined, almost, to, boys, and, beginners, but, is, it, not, true, also, that, much, less, young, men, are, fit, auditors, of, matters, of, policy, till, they, have, been, thoroughly, seasoned, in, religion, and, morality, lest, their, judgments, be, corrupted, and, made, apt, to, think, that, there, are, no, true, differences, of, things, but, according, to, utility, and, fortune, as, the, verse, describes, it, _prosperum, et, felix, scelus, virtus, vocatur_, and, again, _ille, crucem, pretium, sceleris, tulit_, _hic, diadema_, which, the, poets, do, speak, satirically, and, in, indignation, on, virtue’s, behalf, but, books, of, policy, do, speak, it, seriously, and, positively, for, so, it, pleaseth, machiavel, to, say, “that, if, cæsar, had, been, overthrown, he, would, have, been, more, odious, than, ever, was, catiline, ”, as, if, there, had, been, no, difference, but, in, fortune, between, a, very, fury, of, lust, and, blood, and, the, most, excellent, spirit, (his, ambition, reserved), of, the, world, again, is, there, not, a, caution, likewise, to, be, given, of, the, doctrines, of, moralities, themselves, (some, kinds, of, them), lest, they, make, men, too, precise, arrogant, incompatible, as, cicero, saith, of, cato, _in, marco, catone, hæc, bona, quæ, videmus, divina, et, egregia_, _ipsius, scitote, esse, propria_, _quæ, nonunquam, requirimus, ea, sunt, omnia, non, a, natura_, _sed, a, magistro_, many, other, axioms, and, advices, there, are, touching, those, proprieties, and, effects, which, studies, do, infuse, and, instil, into, manners, and, so, likewise, is, there, touching, the, use, of, all, those, other, points, of, company, fame, laws, and, the, rest, which, we, recited, in, the, beginning, in, the, doctrine, of, morality, (14), but, there, is, a, kind, of, culture, of, the, mind, that, seemeth, yet, more, accurate, and, elaborate, than, the, rest, and, is, built, upon, this, ground, that, the, minds, of, all, men, are, at, some, times, in, a, state, more, perfect, and, at, other, times, in, a, state, more, depraved, the, purpose, therefore, of, this, practice, is, to, fix, and, cherish, the, good, hours, of, the, mind, and, to, obliterate, and, take, forth, the, evil, the, fixing, of, the, good, hath, been, practised, by, two, means, vows, or, constant, resolutions, and, observances, or, exercises, which, are, not, to, be, regarded, so, much, in, themselves, as, because, they, keep, the, mind, in, continual, obedience, the, obliteration, of, the, evil, hath, been, practised, by, two, means, some, kind, of, redemption, or, expiation, of, that, which, is, past, and, an, inception, or, account, _de, novo_, for, the, time, to, come, but, this, part, seemeth, sacred, and, religious, and, justly, for, all, good, moral, philosophy, (as, was, said), is, but, a, handmaid, to, religion, (15), wherefore, we, will, conclude, with, that, last, point, which, is, of, all, other, means, the, most, compendious, and, summary, and, again, the, most, noble, and, effectual, to, the, reducing, of, the, mind, unto, virtue, and, good, estate, which, is, the, electing, and, propounding, unto, a, man’s, self, good, and, virtuous, ends, of, his, life, such, as, may, be, in, a, reasonable, sort, within, his, compass, to, attain, for, if, these, two, things, be, supposed, that, a, man, set, before, him, honest, and, good, ends, and, again, that, he, be, resolute, constant, and, true, unto, them, it, will, follow, that, he, shall, mould, himself, into, all, virtue, at, once, and, this, indeed, is, like, the, work, of, nature, whereas, the, other, course, is, like, the, work, of, the, hand, for, as, when, a, carver, makes, an, image, he, shapes, only, that, part, whereupon, he, worketh, as, if, he, be, upon, the, face, that, part, which, shall, be, the, body, is, but, a, rude, stone, still, till, such, times, as, he, comes, to, it, but, contrariwise, when, nature, makes, a, flower, or, living, creature, she, formeth, rudiments, of, all, the, parts, at, one, time, so, in, obtaining, virtue, by, habit, while, a, man, practiseth, temperance, he, doth, not, profit, much, to, fortitude, nor, the, like, but, when, he, dedicateth, and, applieth, himself, to, good, ends, look, what, virtue, soever, the, pursuit, and, passage, towards, those, ends, doth, commend, unto, him, he, is, invested, of, a, precedent, disposition, to, conform, himself, thereunto, which, state, of, mind, aristotle, doth, excellently, express, himself, that, it, ought, not, to, be, called, virtuous, but, divine, his, words, are, these, _immanitati, autem, consentaneum, est, opponere, eam_, _quæ, supra, humanitatem, est_, _heroicam, sive, divinam, virtutem_, and, a, little, after, _nam, ut, feræ, neque, vitium, neque, virtus, est_, _swic, neque, dei_, _sed, hic, quidem, status, altius, quiddam, virtute, est_, _ille, aluid, quiddam, a, vitio_, and, therefore, we, may, see, what, celsitude, of, honour, plinius, secundus, attributeth, to, trajan, in, his, funeral, oration, where, he, said, “that, men, needed, to, make, no, other, prayers, to, the, gods, but, that, they, would, continue, as, good, lords, to, them, as, trajan, had, been, ”, as, if, he, had, not, been, only, an, imitation, of, divine, nature, but, a, pattern, of, it, but, these, be, heathen, and, profane, passages, having, but, a, shadow, of, that, divine, state, of, mind, which, religion, and, the, holy, faith, doth, conduct, men, unto, by, imprinting, upon, their, souls, charity, which, is, excellently, called, the, bond, of, perfection, because, it, comprehendeth, and, fasteneth, all, virtues, together, and, as, it, is, elegantly, said, by, menander, of, vain, love, which, is, but, a, false, imitation, of, divine, love, _amor, melior, sophista, lœvo, ad, humanam, vitam_—that, love, teacheth, a, man, to, carry, himself, better, than, the, sophist, or, preceptor, which, he, calleth, left-handed, because, with, all, his, rules, and, preceptions, he, cannot, form, a, man, so, dexterously, nor, with, that, facility, to, prize, himself, and, govern, himself, as, love, can, do, so, certainly, if, a, man’s, mind, be, truly, inflamed, with, charity, it, doth, work, him, suddenly, into, greater, perfection, than, all, the, doctrine, of, morality, can, do, which, is, but, a, sophist, in, comparison, of, the, other, nay, further, as, xenophon, observed, truly, that, all, other, affections, though, they, raise, the, mind, yet, they, do, it, by, distorting, and, uncomeliness, of, ecstasies, or, excesses, but, only, love, doth, exalt, the, mind, and, nevertheless, at, the, same, instant, doth, settle, and, compose, it, so, in, all, other, excellences, though, they, advance, nature, yet, they, are, subject, to, excess, only, charity, admitteth, no, excess, for, so, we, see, aspiring, to, be, like, god, in, power, the, angels, transgressed, and, fell, _ascendam_, _et, ero, similis, altissimo_, by, aspiring, to, be, like, god, in, knowledge, man, transgressed, and, fell, _eritis, sicut, dii_, _scientes, bonum, et, malum_, but, by, aspiring, to, a, similitude, of, god, in, goodness, or, love, neither, man, nor, angel, ever, transgressed, or, shall, transgress, for, unto, that, imitation, we, are, called, _diligite, inimicos, vestros_, _benefacite, eis, qui, oderunt, vos_, _et, orate, pro, persequentibus, et, calumniantibus, vos_, _ut, sitis, filii, patris, vestri, qui, in, cœlis, est_, _qui, solem, suum, oriri, facit, super, bonos, et, malos_, _et, pluit, super, justos, et, injustos_, so, in, the, first, platform, of, the, divine, nature, itself, the, heathen, religion, speaketh, thus, _optimus, maximus_, and, the, sacred, scriptures, thus, _miscericordia, ejus, super, omnia, opera, ejus_, (16), wherefore, do, conclude, this, part, of, moral, knowledge, concerning, the, culture, and, regiment, of, the, mind, wherein, if, any, man, considering, the, arts, thereof, which, have, enumerated, do, judge, that, my, labour, is, but, to, collect, into, an, art, or, science, that, which, hath, been, pretermitted, by, others, as, matter, of, common, sense, and, experience, he, judgeth, well, but, as, philocrates, sported, with, demosthenes, “you, may, not, marvel, (athenians), that, demosthenes, and, do, differ, for, he, drinketh, water, and, drink, wine, ”, and, like, as, we, read, of, an, ancient, parable, of, the, two, gates, of, sleep—, “sunt, geminæ, somni, portæ, quarum, altera, fertur, cornea, qua, veris, facilis, datur, exitus, umbris, altera, candenti, perfecta, nitens, elephanto, sed, falsa, ad, cœlum, mittunt, insomnia, manes, ”, so, if, we, put, on, sobriety, and, attention, we, shall, find, it, a, sure, maxim, in, knowledge, that, the, more, pleasant, liquor, (“of, wine”), is, the, more, vaporous, and, the, braver, gate, (“of, ivory”), sendeth, forth, the, falser, dreams, (17), but, we, have, now, concluded, that, general, part, of, human, philosophy, which, contemplateth, man, segregate, and, as, he, consisteth, of, body, and, spirit, wherein, we, may, further, note, that, there, seemeth, to, be, a, relation, or, conformity, between, the, good, of, the, mind, and, the, good, of, the, body, for, as, we, divided, the, good, of, the, body, into, health, beauty, strength, and, pleasure, so, the, good, of, the, mind, inquired, in, rational, and, moral, knowledges, tendeth, to, this, to, make, the, mind, sound, and, without, perturbation, beautiful, and, graced, with, decency, and, strong, and, agile, for, all, duties, of, life, these, three, as, in, the, body, so, in, the, mind, seldom, meet, and, commonly, sever, for, it, is, easy, to, observe, that, many, have, strength, of, wit, and, courage, but, have, neither, health, from, perturbations, nor, any, beauty, or, decency, in, their, doings, some, again, have, an, elegancy, and, fineness, of, carriage, which, have, neither, soundness, of, honesty, nor, substance, of, sufficiency, and, some, again, have, honest, and, reformed, minds, that, can, neither, become, themselves, nor, manage, business, and, sometimes, two, of, them, meet, and, rarely, all, three, as, for, pleasure, we, have, likewise, determined, that, the, mind, ought, not, to, be, reduced, to, stupid, but, to, retain, pleasure, confined, rather, in, the, subject, of, it, than, in, the, strength, and, vigour, of, it, (1), civil, knowledge, is, conversant, about, a, subject, which, of, all, others, is, most, immersed, in, matter, and, hardliest, reduced, to, axiom, nevertheless, as, cato, the, censor, said, “that, the, romans, were, like, sheep, for, that, a, man, were, better, drive, a, flock, of, them, than, one, of, them, for, in, a, flock, if, you, could, get, but, some, few, go, right, the, rest, would, follow, ”, so, in, that, respect, moral, philosophy, is, more, difficile, than, policy, again, moral, philosophy, propoundeth, to, itself, the, framing, of, internal, goodness, but, civil, knowledge, requireth, only, an, external, goodness, for, that, as, to, society, sufficeth, and, therefore, it, cometh, oft, to, pass, that, there, be, evil, times, in, good, governments, for, so, we, find, in, the, holy, story, when, the, kings, were, good, yet, it, is, added, _sed, adhuc, poulus, non, direxerat, cor, suum, ad, dominum, deum, patrum, suorum_, again, states, as, great, engines, move, slowly, and, are, not, so, soon, put, out, of, frame, for, as, in, egypt, the, seven, good, years, sustained, the, seven, bad, so, governments, for, a, time, well, grounded, do, bear, out, errors, following, but, the, resolution, of, particular, persons, is, more, suddenly, subverted, these, respects, do, somewhat, qualify, the, extreme, difficulty, of, civil, knowledge, (2), this, knowledge, hath, three, parts, according, to, the, three, summary, actions, of, society, which, are, conversation, negotiation, and, government, for, man, seeketh, in, society, comfort, use, and, protection, and, they, be, three, wisdoms, of, divers, natures, which, do, often, sever—wisdom, of, the, behaviour, wisdom, of, business, and, wisdom, of, state, (3), the, wisdom, of, conversation, ought, not, to, be, over, much, affected, but, much, less, despised, for, it, hath, not, only, an, honour, in, itself, but, an, influence, also, into, business, and, government, the, poet, saith, _nec, vultu, destrue, verba, tuo_, a, man, may, destroy, the, force, of, his, words, with, his, countenance, so, may, he, of, his, deeds, saith, cicero, recommending, to, his, brother, affability, and, easy, access, _nil, interest, habere, ostium, apertum_, _vultum, clausum_, it, is, nothing, won, to, admit, men, with, an, open, door, and, to, receive, them, with, a, shut, and, reserved, countenance, so, we, see, atticus, before, the, first, interview, between, cæsar, and, cicero, the, war, depending, did, seriously, advise, cicero, touching, the, composing, and, ordering, of, his, countenance, and, gesture, and, if, the, government, of, the, countenance, be, of, such, effect, much, more, is, that, of, the, speech, and, other, carriage, appertaining, to, conversation, the, true, model, whereof, seemeth, to, me, well, expressed, by, livy, though, not, meant, for, this, purpose, _ne, aut, arrogans, videar_, _aut, obnoxius_, _quorum, alterum, est, àlienæ, libertatis, obliti_, _alterum, suæ_, the, sum, of, behaviour, is, to, retain, a, man’s, own, dignity, without, intruding, upon, the, liberty, of, others, on, the, other, side, if, behaviour, and, outward, carriage, be, intended, too, much, first, it, may, pass, into, affectation, and, then, _quid, deformius, quam, scenam, in, vitam, transferre_—to, act, a, man’s, life, but, although, it, proceed, not, to, that, extreme, yet, it, consumeth, time, and, employeth, the, mind, too, much, and, therefore, as, we, use, to, advise, young, students, from, company, keeping, by, saying, _amici, fures, temporis_, so, certainly, the, intending, of, the, discretion, of, behaviour, is, a, great, thief, of, meditation, again, such, as, are, accomplished, in, that, form, of, urbanity, please, themselves, in, it, and, seldom, aspire, to, higher, virtue, whereas, those, that, have, defect, in, it, do, seek, comeliness, by, reputation, for, where, reputation, is, almost, everything, becometh, but, where, that, is, not, it, must, be, supplied, by, _puntos_, and, compliments, again, there, is, no, greater, impediment, of, action, than, an, over-curious, observance, of, decency, and, the, guide, of, decency, which, is, time, and, season, for, as, solomon, saith, _qui, respicit, ad, ventos_, _non, seminat_, _et, qui, respicit, ad, nubes_, _non, metet_, a, man, must, make, his, opportunity, as, oft, as, find, it, to, conclude, behaviour, seemeth, to, me, as, a, garment, of, the, mind, and, to, have, the, conditions, of, a, garment, for, it, ought, to, be, made, in, fashion, it, ought, not, to, be, too, curious, it, ought, to, be, shaped, so, as, to, set, forth, any, good, making, of, the, mind, and, hide, any, deformity, and, above, all, it, ought, not, to, be, too, strait, or, restrained, for, exercise, or, motion, but, this, part, of, civil, knowledge, hath, been, elegantly, handled, and, therefore, cannot, report, it, for, deficient, (4), the, wisdom, touching, negotiation, or, business, hath, not, been, hitherto, collected, into, writing, to, the, great, derogation, of, learning, and, the, professors, of, learning, for, from, this, root, springeth, chiefly, that, note, or, opinion, which, by, us, is, expressed, in, adage, to, this, effect, that, there, is, no, great, concurrence, between, learning, and, wisdom, for, of, the, three, wisdoms, which, we, have, set, down, to, pertain, to, civil, life, for, wisdom, of, behaviour, it, is, by, learned, men, for, the, most, part, despised, as, an, inferior, to, virtue, and, an, enemy, to, meditation, for, wisdom, of, government, they, acquit, themselves, well, when, they, are, called, to, it, but, that, happeneth, to, few, but, for, the, wisdom, of, business, wherein, man’s, life, is, most, conversant, there, be, no, books, of, it, except, some, few, scattered, advertisements, that, have, no, proportion, to, the, magnitude, of, this, subject, for, if, books, were, written, of, this, as, the, other, doubt, not, but, learned, men, with, mean, experience, would, far, excel, men, of, long, experience, without, learning, and, outshoot, them, in, their, own, bow, (5), neither, needeth, it, at, all, to, be, doubted, that, this, knowledge, should, be, so, variable, as, it, falleth, not, under, precept, for, it, is, much, less, infinite, than, science, of, government, which, we, see, is, laboured, and, in, some, part, reduced, of, this, wisdom, it, seemeth, some, of, the, ancient, romans, in, the, saddest, and, wisest, times, were, professors, for, cicero, reporteth, that, it, was, then, in, use, for, senators, that, had, name, and, opinion, for, general, wise, men, as, coruncanius, curius, lælius, and, many, others, to, walk, at, certain, hours, in, the, place, and, to, give, audience, to, those, that, would, use, their, advice, and, that, the, particular, citizens, would, resort, unto, them, and, consult, with, them, of, the, marriage, of, a, daughter, or, of, the, employing, of, a, son, or, of, a, purchase, or, bargain, or, of, an, accusation, and, every, other, occasion, incident, to, man’s, life, so, as, there, is, a, wisdom, of, counsel, and, advice, even, in, private, causes, arising, out, of, a, universal, insight, into, the, affairs, of, the, world, which, is, used, indeed, upon, particular, causes, propounded, but, is, gathered, by, general, observation, of, causes, of, like, nature, for, so, we, see, in, the, book, which, cicero, writeth, to, his, brother, _de, petitione, consulatus_, (being, the, only, book, of, business, that, know, written, by, the, ancients), although, it, concerned, a, particular, action, then, on, foot, yet, the, substance, thereof, consisteth, of, many, wise, and, politic, axioms, which, contain, not, a, temporary, but, a, perpetual, direction, in, the, case, of, popular, elections, but, chiefly, we, may, see, in, those, aphorisms, which, have, place, amongst, divine, writings, composed, by, solomon, the, king, of, whom, the, scriptures, testify, that, his, heart, was, as, the, sands, of, the, sea, encompassing, the, world, and, all, worldly, matters, we, see, say, not, a, few, profound, and, excellent, cautions, precepts, positions, extending, to, much, variety, of, occasions, whereupon, we, will, stay, a, while, offering, to, consideration, some, number, of, examples, (6), _sed, et, cunctis, sermonibus, qui, dicuntur, ne, accommodes, aurem, tuam_, _ne, forte, audias, servum, tuum, maledicentem, tibi_, here, is, commended, the, provident, stay, of, inquiry, of, that, which, we, would, be, loth, to, find, as, it, was, judged, great, wisdom, in, pompeius, magnus, that, he, burned, sertorius’, papers, unperused, _vir, sapiens_, _si, cum, stulto, contenderit_, _sive, irascatur_, _sive, rideat_, _non, inveniet, requiem_, here, is, described, the, great, disadvantage, which, a, wise, man, hath, in, undertaking, a, lighter, person, than, himself, which, is, such, an, engagement, as, whether, a, man, turn, the, matter, to, jest, or, turn, it, to, heat, or, howsoever, he, change, copy, he, can, no, ways, quit, himself, well, of, it, _qui, delicate, a, pueritia, nutrit, servum, suum_, _postea, sentiet, eum, contumacem_, here, is, signified, that, if, a, man, begin, too, high, a, pitch, in, his, favours, it, doth, commonly, end, in, unkindness, and, unthankfulness, _vidisti, virum, velocem, in, opere, suo_, _coram, regibus, stabit_, _nec, erit, inter, ignobiles_, here, is, observed, that, of, all, virtues, for, rising, to, honour, quickness, of, despatch, is, the, best, for, superiors, many, times, love, not, to, have, those, they, employ, too, deep, or, too, sufficient, but, ready, and, diligent, _vidi, cunctos, viventes, qui, ambulant, sub, sole_, _cum, adolescente, secundo, qui, consurgit, pro, eo_, here, is, expressed, that, which, was, noted, by, sylla, first, and, after, him, by, tiberius, _plures, adorant, solem, orientem, quam, occidentem, vel, meridianum_, _si, spiritus, potestatem, habentis, ascenderit, super, te_, _locum, tuum, ne, demiseris_, _quia, curatio, faciet, cessare, peccata, maxima_, here, caution, is, given, that, upon, displeasure, retiring, is, of, all, courses, the, unfittest, for, a, man, leaveth, things, at, worst, and, depriveth, himself, of, means, to, make, them, better, _erat, civitas, parva_, _et, pauci, in, ea, viri_, _venit, contra, eam, rex, magnus_, _et, vallavit, eam_, _instruxitque, munitones, per, gyrum_, _et, perfecta, est, obsidio_, _inventusque, est, in, ea, vir, pauper, et, sapiens_, _et, liberavit, eam, per, sapientiam, suam_, _et, nullus, deinceps, recordatus, est, huminis, illius, pauperis_, here, the, corruption, of, states, is, set, forth, that, esteem, not, virtue, or, merit, longer, than, they, have, use, of, it, _millis, responsio, frangit, iram_, here, is, noted, that, silence, or, rough, answer, exasperateth, but, an, answer, present, and, temperate, pacifieth, _iter, pigrorum, quasi, sepes, spinarum_, here, is, lively, represented, how, laborious, sloth, proveth, in, the, end, for, when, things, are, deferred, till, the, last, instant, and, nothing, prepared, beforehand, every, step, findeth, a, briar, or, impediment, which, catcheth, or, stoppeth, _melior, est, finis, orationis, quam, principium_, here, is, taxed, the, vanity, of, formal, speakers, that, study, more, about, prefaces, and, inducements, than, upon, the, conclusions, and, issues, of, speech, _qui, cognoscit, in, judicio, faciem_, _non, bene, facit_, _iste, et, pro, buccella, panis, deseret, veritatem_, here, is, noted, that, a, judge, were, better, be, a, briber, than, a, respecter, of, persons, for, a, corrupt, judge, offendeth, not, so, lightly, as, a, facile, _vir, pauper, calumnians, pauperes, simils, est, imbri, vehementi_, _in, quo, paratur, fames_, here, is, expressed, the, extremity, of, necessitous, extortions, figured, in, the, ancient, fable, of, the, full, and, the, hungry, horseleech, _fons, turbatus, pede_, _et, vena, corrupta_, _est, justus, cadens, coram, impio_, here, is, noted, that, one, judicial, and, exemplar, iniquity, in, the, face, of, the, world, doth, trouble, the, fountains, of, justice, more, than, many, particular, injuries, passed, over, by, connivance, _qui, subtrahit, aliquid, a, patre, et, a, matre_, _et, dicit, hoc, non, esse, peccatum_, _particeps, est, homicidii_, here, is, noted, that, whereas, men, in, wronging, their, best, friends, use, to, extenuate, their, fault, as, if, they, might, presume, or, be, bold, upon, them, it, doth, contrariwise, indeed, aggravate, their, fault, and, turneth, it, from, injury, to, impiety, _noli, esse, amicus, homini, iracundo_, _nec, ambulato, cum, homine, furioso_, here, caution, is, given, that, in, the, election, of, our, friends, we, do, principally, avoid, those, which, are, impatient, as, those, that, will, espouse, us, to, many, factions, and, quarrels, _qui, conturbat, domum, suam_, _possidebit, ventum_, here, is, noted, that, in, domestical, separations, and, breaches, men, do, promise, to, themselves, quieting, of, their, mind, and, contentment, but, still, they, are, deceived, of, their, expectation, and, it, turneth, to, wind, _filius, sapiens, lætificat, patrem_, _filius, vero, stultus, mæstitia, est, matri, suæ_, here, is, distinguished, that, fathers, have, most, comfort, of, the, good, proof, of, their, sons, but, mothers, have, most, discomfort, of, their, ill, proof, because, women, have, little, discerning, of, virtue, but, of, fortune, _qui, celat, delictum_, _quærit, amicitiam_, _sed, qui, altero, sermone, repetit_, _separat, fæderatos_, here, caution, is, given, that, reconcilement, is, better, managed, by, an, amnesty, and, passing, over, that, which, is, past, than, by, apologies, and, excuses, _in, omni, opere, bono, erit, abundantia_, _ubi, autem, verba, sunt, plurima_, _ibi, frequenter, egestas_, here, is, noted, that, words, and, discourse, aboundeth, most, where, there, is, idleness, and, want, _primus, in, sua, causa, justus_, _sed, venit, altera, pars_, _et, inquiret, in, eum_, here, is, observed, that, in, all, causes, the, first, tale, possesseth, much, in, sort, that, the, prejudice, thereby, wrought, will, be, hardly, removed, except, some, abuse, or, falsity, in, the, information, be, detected, _verba, bilinguis, quasi, simplicia_, _et, ipsa, perveniunt, ad, interiora, ventris_, here, is, distinguished, that, flattery, and, insinuation, which, seemeth, set, and, artificial, sinketh, not, far, but, that, entereth, deep, which, hath, show, of, nature, liberty, and, simplicity, _qui, erudit, derisorem_, _ipse, sibi, injuriam, facit_, _et, qui, arguit, impium_, _sibi, maculam, generat_, here, caution, is, given, how, we, tender, reprehension, to, arrogant, and, scornful, natures, whose, manner, is, to, esteem, it, for, contumely, and, accordingly, to, return, it, _da, sapienti, occasionem_, _et, addetur, ei, sapientia_, here, is, distinguished, the, wisdom, brought, into, habit, and, that, which, is, but, verbal, and, swimming, only, in, conceit, for, the, one, upon, the, occasion, presented, is, quickened, and, redoubled, the, other, is, amazed, and, confused, _quomodo, in, aquis, resplendent, vultus, prospicientium_, _sic, corda, hominum, manifesta, sunt, prudentibus_, here, the, mind, of, a, wise, man, is, compared, to, a, glass, wherein, the, images, of, all, diversity, of, natures, and, customs, are, represented, from, which, representation, proceedeth, that, application, “qui, sapit, innumeris, moribus, aptus, erit, ”, (7), thus, have, stayed, somewhat, longer, upon, these, sentences, politic, of, solomon, than, is, agreeable, to, the, proportion, of, an, example, led, with, a, desire, to, give, authority, to, this, part, of, knowledge, which, noted, as, deficient, by, so, excellent, a, precedent, and, have, also, attended, them, with, brief, observations, such, as, to, my, understanding, offer, no, violence, to, the, sense, though, know, they, may, be, applied, to, a, more, divine, use, but, it, is, allowed, even, in, divinity, that, some, interpretations, yea, and, some, writings, have, more, of, the, eagle, than, others, but, taking, them, as, instructions, for, life, they, might, have, received, large, discourse, if, would, have, broken, them, and, illustrated, them, by, deducements, and, examples, (8), neither, was, this, in, use, only, with, the, hebrews, but, it, is, generally, to, be, found, in, the, wisdom, of, the, more, ancient, times, that, as, men, found, out, any, observation, that, they, thought, was, good, for, life, they, would, gather, it, and, express, it, in, parable, or, aphorism, or, fable, but, for, fables, they, were, vicegerents, and, supplies, where, examples, failed, now, that, the, times, abound, with, history, the, aim, is, better, when, the, mark, is, alive, and, therefore, the, form, of, writing, which, of, all, others, is, fittest, for, this, variable, argument, of, negotiation, and, occasions, is, that, which, machiavel, chose, wisely, and, aptly, for, government, namely, discourse, upon, histories, or, examples, for, knowledge, drawn, freshly, and, in, our, view, out, of, particulars, knoweth, the, way, best, to, particulars, again, and, it, hath, much, greater, life, for, practice, when, the, discourse, attendeth, upon, the, example, than, when, the, example, attendeth, upon, the, discourse, for, this, is, no, point, of, order, as, it, seemeth, at, first, but, of, substance, for, when, the, example, is, the, ground, being, set, down, in, a, history, at, large, it, is, set, down, with, all, circumstances, which, may, sometimes, control, the, discourse, thereupon, made, and, sometimes, supply, it, as, a, very, pattern, for, action, whereas, the, examples, alleged, for, the, discourse’s, sake, are, cited, succinctly, and, without, particularity, and, carry, a, servile, aspect, towards, the, discourse, which, they, are, brought, in, to, make, good, (9), but, this, difference, is, not, amiss, to, be, remembered, that, as, history, of, times, is, the, best, ground, for, discourse, of, government, such, as, machiavel, handleth, so, histories, of, lives, is, the, most, popular, for, discourse, of, business, because, it, is, more, conversant, in, private, actions, nay, there, is, a, ground, of, discourse, for, this, purpose, fitter, than, them, both, which, is, discourse, upon, letters, such, as, are, wise, and, weighty, as, many, are, of, cicero, _ad, atticum_, and, others, for, letters, have, a, great, and, more, particular, representation, of, business, than, either, chronicles, or, lives, thus, have, we, spoken, both, of, the, matter, and, form, of, this, part, of, civil, knowledge, touching, negotiation, which, we, note, to, be, deficient, (10), but, yet, there, is, another, part, of, this, part, which, differeth, as, much, from, that, whereof, we, have, spoken, as, _sapere_, and, _sibi, sapere_, the, one, moving, as, it, were, to, the, circumference, the, other, to, the, centre, for, there, is, a, wisdom, of, counsel, and, again, there, is, a, wisdom, of, pressing, a, man’s, own, fortune, and, they, do, sometimes, meet, and, often, sever, for, many, are, wise, in, their, own, ways, that, are, weak, for, government, or, counsel, like, ants, which, is, a, wise, creature, for, itself, but, very, hurtful, for, the, garden, this, wisdom, the, romans, did, take, much, knowledge, of, _nam, pol, sapiens_, (saith, the, comical, poet), _fingit, fortunam, sibi_, and, it, grew, to, an, adage, _faber, quisque, fortunæ, propriæ_, and, livy, attributed, it, to, cato, the, first, _in, hoc, viro, tanta, vis, animi, et, ingenii, inerat_, _ut, quocunque, loco, natus, esset, sibi, ipse, fortunam, facturus, videretur_, (11), this, conceit, or, position, if, it, be, too, much, declared, and, professed, hath, been, thought, a, thing, impolitic, and, unlucky, as, was, observed, in, timotheus, the, athenian, who, having, done, many, great, services, to, the, state, in, his, government, and, giving, an, account, thereof, to, the, people, as, the, manner, was, did, conclude, every, particular, with, this, clause, “and, in, this, fortune, had, no, part, ”, and, it, came, so, to, pass, that, he, never, prospered, in, anything, he, took, in, hand, afterwards, for, this, is, too, high, and, too, arrogant, savouring, of, that, which, ezekiel, saith, of, pharaoh, _dicis_, _fluvius, est, neus, et, ego, feci, memet, ipsum_, or, of, that, which, another, prophet, speaketh, that, men, offer, sacrifices, to, their, nets, and, snares, and, that, which, the, poet, expresseth, “dextra, mihi, deus, et, telum, quod, missile, libro, nunc, adsint, ”, for, these, confidences, were, ever, unhallowed, and, unblessed, and, therefore, those, that, were, great, politiques, indeed, ever, ascribed, their, successes, to, their, felicity, and, not, to, their, skill, or, virtue, for, so, sylla, surnamed, himself, felix, not, magnus, so, cæsar, said, to, the, master, of, the, ship, _cæsarem, portas, et, fortunam, ejus_, (12), but, yet, nevertheless, these, positions, _faber, quisque, fortunæ, suæ_, _sapiens, dominabitur, astris_, _invia, virtuti, null, est, via_, and, the, like, being, taken, and, used, as, spurs, to, industry, and, not, as, stirrups, to, insolency, rather, for, resolution, than, for, the, presumption, or, outward, declaration, have, been, ever, thought, sound, and, good, and, are, no, question, imprinted, in, the, greatest, minds, who, are, so, sensible, of, this, opinion, as, they, can, scarce, contain, it, within, as, we, see, in, augustus, cæsar, (who, was, rather, diverse, from, his, uncle, than, inferior, in, virtue), how, when, he, died, he, desired, his, friends, about, him, to, give, him, a, _plaudite_, as, if, he, were, conscious, to, himself, that, he, had, played, his, part, well, upon, the, stage, this, part, of, knowledge, we, do, report, also, as, deficient, not, but, that, it, is, practised, too, much, but, it, hath, not, been, reduced, to, writing, and, therefore, lest, it, should, seem, to, any, that, it, is, not, comprehensible, by, axiom, it, is, requisite, as, we, did, in, the, former, that, we, set, down, some, heads, or, passages, of, it, (13), wherein, it, may, appear, at, the, first, a, new, and, unwonted, argument, to, teach, men, how, to, raise, and, make, their, fortune, a, doctrine, wherein, every, man, perchance, will, be, ready, to, yield, himself, a, disciple, till, he, see, the, difficulty, for, fortune, layeth, as, heavy, impositions, as, virtue, and, it, is, as, hard, and, severe, a, thing, to, be, a, true, politique, as, to, be, truly, moral, but, the, handling, hereof, concerneth, learning, greatly, both, in, honour, and, in, substance, in, honour, because, pragmatical, men, may, not, go, away, with, an, opinion, that, learning, is, like, a, lark, that, can, mount, and, sing, and, please, herself, and, nothing, else, but, may, know, that, she, holdeth, as, well, of, the, hawk, that, can, soar, aloft, and, can, also, descend, and, strike, upon, the, prey, in, substance, because, it, is, the, perfect, law, of, inquiry, of, truth, that, nothing, be, in, the, globe, of, matter, which, should, not, be, likewise, in, the, globe, of, crystal, or, form, that, is, that, there, be, not, anything, in, being, and, action, which, should, not, be, drawn, and, collected, into, contemplation, and, doctrine, neither, doth, learning, admire, or, esteem, of, this, architecture, of, fortune, otherwise, than, as, of, an, inferior, work, for, no, man’s, fortune, can, be, an, end, worthy, of, his, being, and, many, times, the, worthiest, men, do, abandon, their, fortune, willingly, for, better, respects, but, nevertheless, fortune, as, an, organ, of, virtue, and, merit, deserveth, the, consideration, (14), first, therefore, the, precept, which, conceive, to, be, most, summary, towards, the, prevailing, in, fortune, is, to, obtain, that, window, which, momus, did, require, who, seeing, in, the, frame, of, man’s, heart, such, angles, and, recesses, found, fault, there, was, not, a, window, to, look, into, them, that, is, to, procure, good, informations, of, particulars, touching, persons, their, natures, their, desires, and, ends, their, customs, and, fashions, their, helps, and, advantages, and, whereby, they, chiefly, stand, so, again, their, weaknesses, and, disadvantages, and, where, they, lie, most, open, and, obnoxious, their, friends, factions, dependences, and, again, their, opposites, enviers, competitors, their, moods, and, times, _sola, viri, molles, aditus, et, tempora, noras_, their, principles, rules, and, observations, and, the, like, and, this, not, only, of, persons, but, of, actions, what, are, on, foot, from, time, to, time, and, how, they, are, conducted, favoured, opposed, and, how, they, import, and, the, like, for, the, knowledge, of, present, actions, is, not, only, material, in, itself, but, without, it, also, the, knowledge, of, persons, is, very, erroneous, for, men, change, with, the, actions, and, whilst, they, are, in, pursuit, they, are, one, and, when, they, return, to, their, nature, they, are, another, these, informations, of, particulars, touching, persons, and, actions, are, as, the, minor, propositions, in, every, active, syllogism, for, no, excellency, of, observations, (which, are, as, the, major, propositions), can, suffice, to, ground, a, conclusion, if, there, be, error, and, mistaking, in, the, minors, (15), that, this, knowledge, is, possible, solomon, is, our, surety, who, saith, _consilium, in, corde, viri, tanquam, aqua, profunda_, _sed, vir, prudens, exhauriet, illud_, and, although, the, knowledge, itself, falleth, not, under, precept, because, it, is, of, individuals, yet, the, instructions, for, the, obtaining, of, it, may, (16), we, will, begin, therefore, with, this, precept, according, to, the, ancient, opinion, that, the, sinews, of, wisdom, are, slowness, of, belief, and, distrust, that, more, trust, be, given, to, countenances, and, deeds, than, to, words, and, in, words, rather, to, sudden, passages, and, surprised, words, than, to, set, and, purposed, words, neither, let, that, be, feared, which, is, said, _fronti, nulla, fides_, which, is, meant, of, a, general, outward, behaviour, and, not, of, the, private, and, subtle, motions, and, labours, of, the, countenance, and, gesture, which, as, cicero, elegantly, saith, is, _animi, janua_, “the, gate, of, the, mind, ”, none, more, close, than, tiberius, and, yet, tacitus, saith, of, gallus, _etenim, vultu, offensionem, conjectaverat_, so, again, noting, the, differing, character, and, manner, of, his, commending, germanicus, and, drusus, in, the, senate, he, saith, touching, his, fashion, wherein, he, carried, his, speech, of, germanicus, thus, _magis, in, speciem, adornatis, verbis_, _quam, ut, penitus, sentire, crederetur_, but, of, drusus, thus, _paucioribus, sed, intentior_, _et, fida, oratione_, and, in, another, place, speaking, of, his, character, of, speech, when, he, did, anything, that, was, gracious, and, popular, he, saith, “that, in, other, things, he, was, _velut, eluctantium, verborum_, ”, but, then, again, _solutius, loquebatur, quando, subveniret_, so, that, there, is, no, such, artificer, of, dissimulation, nor, no, such, commanded, countenance, (_vultus, jussus_), that, can, sever, from, a, feigned, tale, some, of, these, fashions, either, a, more, slight, and, careless, fashion, or, more, set, and, formal, or, more, tedious, and, wandering, or, coming, from, a, man, more, drily, and, hardly, (17), neither, are, deeds, such, assured, pledges, as, that, they, may, be, trusted, without, a, judicious, consideration, of, their, magnitude, and, nature, _fraus, sibi, in, parvis, fidem, præstruit, ut, majore, emolumento, fallat_, and, the, italian, thinketh, himself, upon, the, point, to, be, bought, and, sold, when, he, is, better, used, than, he, was, wont, to, be, without, manifest, cause, for, small, favours, they, do, but, lull, men, to, sleep, both, as, to, caution, and, as, to, industry, and, are, as, demosthenes, calleth, them, _alimenta, socordiæ_, so, again, we, see, how, false, the, nature, of, some, deeds, are, in, that, particular, which, mutianus, practised, upon, antonius, primus, upon, that, hollow, and, unfaithful, reconcilement, which, was, made, between, them, whereupon, mutianus, advanced, many, of, the, friends, of, antonius, _simul, amicis, ejus, præfecturas, et, tribunatus, largitur_, wherein, under, pretence, to, strengthen, him, he, did, desolate, him, and, won, from, him, his, dependents, (18), as, for, words, though, they, be, like, waters, to, physicians, full, of, flattery, and, uncertainty, yet, they, are, not, to, be, despised, specially, with, the, advantage, of, passion, and, affection, for, so, we, see, tiberius, upon, a, stinging, and, incensing, speech, of, agrippina, came, a, step, forth, of, his, dissimulation, when, he, said, “you, are, hurt, because, you, do, not, reign, ”, of, which, tacitus, saith, _audita, hæc, raram, occulti, pectoris, vocem, elicuere_, _correptamque, græco, versu, admonuit_, _ideo, lædi, quia, non, regnaret_, and, therefore, the, poet, doth, elegantly, call, passions, tortures, that, urge, men, to, confess, their, secrets, —, “vino, torus, et, ira, ”, and, experience, showeth, there, are, few, men, so, true, to, themselves, and, so, settled, but, that, sometimes, upon, heat, sometimes, upon, bravery, sometimes, upon, kindness, sometimes, upon, trouble, of, mind, and, weakness, they, open, themselves, specially, if, they, be, put, to, it, with, a, counter-dissimulation, according, to, the, proverb, of, spain, _di, mentira_, _y, sacar, as, verdad_, “tell, a, lie, and, find, a, truth, ”, (19), as, for, the, knowing, of, men, which, is, at, second, hand, from, reports, men’s, weaknesses, and, faults, are, best, known, from, their, enemies, their, virtues, and, abilities, from, their, friends, their, customs, and, times, from, their, servants, their, conceits, and, opinions, from, their, familiar, friends, with, whom, they, discourse, most, general, fame, is, light, and, the, opinions, conceived, by, superiors, or, equals, are, deceitful, for, to, such, men, are, more, masked, _verior, fama, e, domesticis, emanat_, (20), but, the, soundest, disclosing, and, expounding, of, men, is, by, their, natures, and, ends, wherein, the, weakest, sort, of, men, are, best, interpreted, by, their, natures, and, the, wisest, by, their, ends, for, it, was, both, pleasantly, and, wisely, said, (though, think, very, untruly), by, a, nuncio, of, the, pope, returning, from, a, certain, nation, where, he, served, as, lidger, whose, opinion, being, asked, touching, the, appointment, of, one, to, go, in, his, place, he, wished, that, in, any, case, they, did, not, send, one, that, was, too, wise, because, no, very, wise, man, would, ever, imagine, what, they, in, that, country, were, like, to, do, and, certainly, it, is, an, error, frequent, for, men, to, shoot, over, and, to, suppose, deeper, ends, and, more, compass, reaches, than, are, the, italian, proverb, being, elegant, and, for, the, most, part, true, —, “di, danari, di, senno, e, di, fede, c’è, ne, manco, che, non, credi, ”, “there, is, commonly, less, money, less, wisdom, and, less, good, faith, than, men, do, account, upon, ”, (21), but, princes, upon, a, far, other, reason, are, best, interpreted, by, their, natures, and, private, persons, by, their, ends, for, princes, being, at, the, top, of, human, desires, they, have, for, the, most, part, no, particular, ends, whereto, they, aspire, by, distance, from, which, a, man, might, take, measure, and, scale, of, the, rest, of, their, actions, and, desires, which, is, one, of, the, causes, that, maketh, their, hearts, more, inscrutable, neither, is, it, sufficient, to, inform, ourselves, in, men’s, ends, and, natures, of, the, variety, of, them, only, but, also, of, the, predominancy, what, humour, reigneth, most, and, what, end, is, principally, sought, for, so, we, see, when, tigellinus, saw, himself, outstripped, by, petronius, turpilianus, in, nero’s, humours, of, pleasures, _metus, ejus, rimatur_, he, wrought, upon, nero’s, fears, whereby, he, broke, the, other’s, neck, (22), but, to, all, this, part, of, inquiry, the, most, compendious, way, resteth, in, three, things, the, first, to, have, general, acquaintance, and, inwardness, with, those, which, have, general, acquaintance, and, look, most, into, the, world, and, specially, according, to, the, diversity, of, business, and, the, diversity, of, persons, to, have, privacy, and, conversation, with, some, one, friend, at, least, which, is, perfect, and, well-intelligenced, in, every, several, kind, the, second, is, to, keep, a, good, mediocrity, in, liberty, of, speech, and, secrecy, in, most, things, liberty, secrecy, where, it, importeth, for, liberty, of, speech, inviteth, and, provoketh, liberty, to, be, used, again, and, so, bringeth, much, to, a, man’s, knowledge, and, secrecy, on, the, other, side, induceth, trust, and, inwardness, the, last, is, the, reducing, of, a, man’s, self, to, this, watchful, and, serene, habit, as, to, make, account, and, purpose, in, every, conference, and, action, as, well, to, observe, as, to, act, for, as, epictetus, would, have, a, philosopher, in, every, particular, action, to, say, to, himself, _et, hoc, volo_, _et, etiam, institutum, servare_, so, a, politic, man, in, everything, should, say, to, himself, _et, hoc, volo_, _ac, etiam, aliquid, addiscere_, have, stayed, the, longer, upon, this, precept, of, obtaining, good, information, because, it, is, a, main, part, by, itself, which, answereth, to, all, the, rest, but, above, all, things, caution, must, be, taken, that, men, have, a, good, stay, and, hold, of, themselves, and, that, this, much, knowing, do, not, draw, on, much, meddling, for, nothing, is, more, unfortunate, than, light, and, rash, intermeddling, in, many, matters, so, that, this, variety, of, knowledge, tendeth, in, conclusion, but, only, to, this, to, make, a, better, and, freer, choice, of, those, actions, which, may, concern, us, and, to, conduct, them, with, the, less, error, and, the, more, dexterity, (23), the, second, precept, concerning, this, knowledge, is, for, men, to, take, good, information, touching, their, own, person, and, well, to, understand, themselves, knowing, that, as, st, james, saith, though, men, look, oft, in, a, glass, yet, they, do, suddenly, forget, themselves, wherein, as, the, divine, glass, is, the, word, of, god, so, the, politic, glass, is, the, state, of, the, world, or, times, wherein, we, live, in, the, which, we, are, to, behold, ourselves, (24), for, men, ought, to, take, an, impartial, view, of, their, own, abilities, and, virtues, and, again, of, their, wants, and, impediments, accounting, these, with, the, most, and, those, other, with, the, least, and, from, this, view, and, examination, to, frame, the, considerations, following, (25), first, to, consider, how, the, constitution, of, their, nature, sorteth, with, the, general, state, of, the, times, which, if, they, find, agreeable, and, fit, then, in, all, things, to, give, themselves, more, scope, and, liberty, but, if, differing, and, dissonant, then, in, the, whole, course, of, their, life, to, be, more, close, retired, and, reserved, as, we, see, in, tiberius, who, was, never, seen, at, a, play, and, came, not, into, the, senate, in, twelve, of, his, last, years, whereas, augustus, cæsar, lived, ever, in, men’s, eyes, which, tacitus, observeth, _alia, tiberio, morum, via_, (26), secondly, to, consider, how, their, nature, sorteth, with, professions, and, courses, of, life, and, accordingly, to, make, election, if, they, be, free, and, if, engaged, to, make, the, departure, at, the, first, opportunity, as, we, see, was, done, by, duke, valentine, that, was, designed, by, his, father, to, a, sacerdotal, profession, but, quitted, it, soon, after, in, regard, of, his, parts, and, inclination, being, such, nevertheless, as, a, man, cannot, tell, well, whether, they, were, worse, for, a, prince, or, for, a, priest, (27), thirdly, to, consider, how, they, sort, with, those, whom, they, are, like, to, have, competitors, and, concurrents, and, to, take, that, course, wherein, there, is, most, solitude, and, themselves, like, to, be, most, eminent, as, cæsar, julius, did, who, at, first, was, an, orator, or, pleader, but, when, he, saw, the, excellency, of, cicero, hortensius, catulus, and, others, for, eloquence, and, saw, there, was, no, man, of, reputation, for, the, wars, but, pompeius, upon, whom, the, state, was, forced, to, rely, he, forsook, his, course, begun, towards, a, civil, and, popular, greatness, and, transferred, his, designs, to, a, martial, greatness, (28), fourthly, in, the, choice, of, their, friends, and, dependents, to, proceed, according, to, the, composition, of, their, own, nature, as, we, may, see, in, cæsar, all, whose, friends, and, followers, were, men, active, and, effectual, but, not, solemn, or, of, reputation, (29), fifthly, to, take, special, heed, how, they, guide, themselves, by, examples, in, thinking, they, can, do, as, they, see, others, do, whereas, perhaps, their, natures, and, carriages, are, far, differing, in, which, error, it, seemeth, pompey, was, of, whom, cicero, saith, that, he, was, wont, often, to, say, _sylla, potuit_, _ego, non, potero_, wherein, he, was, much, abused, the, natures, and, proceedings, of, himself, and, his, example, being, the, unlikest, in, the, world, the, one, being, fierce, violent, and, pressing, the, fact, the, other, solemn, and, full, of, majesty, and, circumstance, and, therefore, the, less, effectual, but, this, precept, touching, the, politic, knowledge, of, ourselves, hath, many, other, branches, whereupon, we, cannot, insist, (30), next, to, the, well, understanding, and, discerning, of, a, man’s, self, there, followeth, the, well, opening, and, revealing, a, man’s, self, wherein, we, see, nothing, more, usual, than, for, the, more, able, man, to, make, the, less, show, for, there, is, a, great, advantage, in, the, well, setting, forth, of, a, man’s, virtues, fortunes, merits, and, again, in, the, artificial, covering, of, a, man’s, weaknesses, defects, disgraces, staying, upon, the, one, sliding, from, the, other, cherishing, the, one, by, circumstances, gracing, the, other, by, exposition, and, the, like, wherein, we, see, what, tacitus, saith, of, mutianus, who, was, the, greatest, politique, of, his, time, _omnium, quæ, dixerat, feceratque, arte, quadam, ostentator_, which, requireth, indeed, some, art, lest, it, turn, tedious, and, arrogant, but, yet, so, as, ostentation, (though, it, be, to, the, first, degree, of, vanity), seemeth, to, me, rather, a, vice, in, manners, than, in, policy, for, as, it, is, said, _audacter, calumniare_, _semper, aliquid, hæret_, so, except, it, be, in, a, ridiculous, degree, of, deformity, _audacter, te, vendita_, _semper, aluquid, hæret_, for, it, will, stick, with, the, more, ignorant, and, inferior, sort, of, men, though, men, of, wisdom, and, rank, do, smile, at, it, and, despise, it, and, yet, the, authority, won, with, many, doth, countervail, the, disdain, of, a, few, but, if, it, be, carried, with, decency, and, government, as, with, a, natural, pleasant, and, ingenious, fashion, or, at, times, when, it, is, mixed, with, some, peril, and, unsafety, (as, in, military, persons), or, at, times, when, others, are, most, envied, or, with, easy, and, careless, passage, to, it, and, from, it, without, dwelling, too, long, or, being, too, serious, or, with, an, equal, freedom, of, taxing, a, man’s, self, as, well, as, gracing, himself, or, by, occasion, of, repelling, or, putting, down, others’, injury, or, insolency, it, doth, greatly, add, to, reputation, and, surely, not, a, few, solid, natures, that, want, this, ventosity, and, cannot, sail, in, the, height, of, the, winds, are, not, without, some, prejudice, and, disadvantage, by, their, moderation, (31), but, for, these, flourishes, and, enhancements, of, virtue, as, they, are, not, perchance, unnecessary, so, it, is, at, least, necessary, that, virtue, be, not, disvalued, and, embased, under, the, just, price, which, is, done, in, three, manners—by, offering, and, obtruding, a, man’s, self, wherein, men, think, he, is, rewarded, when, he, is, accepted, by, doing, too, much, which, will, not, give, that, which, is, well, done, leave, to, settle, and, in, the, end, induceth, satiety, and, by, finding, too, soon, the, fruit, of, a, man’s, virtue, in, commendation, applause, honour, favour, wherein, if, a, man, be, pleased, with, a, little, let, him, hear, what, is, truly, said, _cave, ne, insuetus, rebus, majoribus, videaris_, _si, hæc, te, res, parva, sicuti, magna, delectat_, (32), but, the, covering, of, defects, is, of, no, less, importance, than, the, valuing, of, good, parts, which, may, be, done, likewise, in, three, manners—by, caution, by, colour, and, by, confidence, caution, is, when, men, do, ingeniously, and, discreetly, avoid, to, be, put, into, those, things, for, which, they, are, not, proper, whereas, contrariwise, bold, and, unquiet, spirits, will, thrust, themselves, into, matters, without, difference, and, so, publish, and, proclaim, all, their, wants, colour, is, when, men, make, a, way, for, themselves, to, have, a, construction, made, of, their, faults, or, wants, as, proceeding, from, a, better, cause, or, intended, for, some, other, purpose, for, of, the, one, it, is, well, said, “sæpe, latet, vitium, proximitate, boni, ”, and, therefore, whatsoever, want, a, man, hath, he, must, see, that, he, pretend, the, virtue, that, shadoweth, it, as, if, he, be, dull, he, must, affect, gravity, if, a, coward, mildness, and, so, the, rest, for, the, second, a, man, must, frame, some, probable, cause, why, he, should, not, do, his, best, and, why, he, should, dissemble, his, abilities, and, for, that, purpose, must, use, to, dissemble, those, abilities, which, are, notorious, in, him, to, give, colour, that, his, true, wants, are, but, industries, and, dissimulations, for, confidence, it, is, the, last, but, the, surest, remedy—namely, to, depress, and, seem, to, despise, whatsoever, a, man, cannot, attain, observing, the, good, principle, of, the, merchants, who, endeavour, to, raise, the, price, of, their, own, commodities, and, to, beat, down, the, price, of, others, but, there, is, a, confidence, that, passeth, this, other, which, is, to, face, out, a, man’s, own, defects, in, seeming, to, conceive, that, he, is, best, in, those, things, wherein, he, is, failing, and, to, help, that, again, to, seem, on, the, other, side, that, he, hath, least, opinion, of, himself, in, those, things, wherein, he, is, best, like, as, we, shall, see, it, commonly, in, poets, that, if, they, show, their, verses, and, you, except, to, any, they, will, say, “that, that, line, cost, them, more, labour, than, any, of, the, rest, ”, and, presently, will, seem, to, disable, and, suspect, rather, some, other, line, which, they, know, well, enough, to, be, the, best, in, the, number, but, above, all, in, this, righting, and, helping, of, a, man’s, self, in, his, own, carriage, he, must, take, heed, he, show, not, himself, dismantled, and, exposed, to, scorn, and, injury, by, too, much, dulceness, goodness, and, facility, of, nature, but, show, some, sparkles, of, liberty, spirit, and, edge, which, kind, of, fortified, carriage, with, a, ready, rescussing, of, a, man’s, self, from, scorns, is, sometimes, of, necessity, imposed, upon, men, by, somewhat, in, their, person, or, fortune, but, it, ever, succeedeth, with, good, felicity, (33), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, is, by, all, possible, endeavour, to, frame, the, mind, to, be, pliant, and, obedient, to, occasion, for, nothing, hindereth, men’s, fortunes, so, much, as, this, _idem, manebat_, _neque, idem, decebat_—men, are, where, they, were, when, occasions, turn, and, therefore, to, cato, whom, livy, maketh, such, an, architect, of, fortune, he, addeth, that, he, had, _versatile, ingenium_, and, thereof, it, cometh, that, these, grave, solemn, wits, which, must, be, like, themselves, and, cannot, make, departures, have, more, dignity, than, felicity, but, in, some, it, is, nature, to, be, somewhat, vicious, and, enwrapped, and, not, easy, to, turn, in, some, it, is, a, conceit, that, is, almost, a, nature, which, is, that, men, can, hardly, make, themselves, believe, that, they, ought, to, change, their, course, when, they, have, found, good, by, it, in, former, experience, for, machiavel, noted, wisely, how, fabius, maximus, would, have, been, temporising, still, according, to, his, old, bias, when, the, nature, of, the, war, was, altered, and, required, hot, pursuit, in, some, other, it, is, want, of, point, and, penetration, in, their, judgment, that, they, do, not, discern, when, things, have, a, period, but, come, in, too, late, after, the, occasion, as, demosthenes, compareth, the, people, of, athens, to, country, fellows, when, they, play, in, a, fence, school, that, if, they, have, a, blow, then, they, remove, their, weapon, to, that, ward, and, not, before, in, some, other, it, is, a, lothness, to, lose, labours, passed, and, a, conceit, that, they, can, bring, about, occasions, to, their, ply, and, yet, in, the, end, when, they, see, no, other, remedy, then, they, come, to, it, with, disadvantage, as, tarquinius, that, gave, for, the, third, part, of, sibylla’s, books, the, treble, price, when, he, might, at, first, have, had, all, three, for, the, simple, but, from, whatsoever, root, or, cause, this, restiveness, of, mind, proceedeth, it, is, a, thing, most, prejudicial, and, nothing, is, more, politic, than, to, make, the, wheels, of, our, mind, concentric, and, voluble, with, the, wheels, of, fortune, (34), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, which, hath, some, affinity, with, that, we, last, spoke, of, but, with, difference, is, that, which, is, well, expressed, _fatis, accede, deisque_, that, men, do, not, only, turn, with, the, occasions, but, also, run, with, the, occasions, and, not, strain, their, credit, or, strength, to, over-hard, or, extreme, points, but, choose, in, their, actions, that, which, is, most, passable, for, this, will, preserve, men, from, foil, not, occupy, them, too, much, about, one, matter, win, opinion, of, moderation, please, the, most, and, make, a, show, of, a, perpetual, felicity, in, all, they, undertake, which, cannot, but, mightily, increase, reputation, (35), another, part, of, this, knowledge, seemeth, to, have, some, repugnancy, with, the, former, two, but, not, as, understand, it, and, it, is, that, which, demosthenes, uttereth, in, high, terms, _et, quemadmodum, receptum, est_, _ut, exercitum, ducat, imperator_, _sic, et, a, cordatis, viris, res, ipsæ, ducendæ_, _ut, quæipsis, videntur_, _ea, gerantur_, _et, non, ipsi, eventus, persequi, cogantur_, for, if, we, observe, we, shall, find, two, differing, kinds, of, sufficiency, in, managing, of, business, some, can, make, use, of, occasions, aptly, and, dexterously, but, plot, little, some, can, urge, and, pursue, their, own, plots, well, but, cannot, accommodate, nor, take, in, either, of, which, is, very, imperfect, without, the, other, (36), another, part, of, this, knowledge, is, the, observing, a, good, mediocrity, in, the, declaring, or, not, declaring, a, man’s, self, for, although, depth, of, secrecy, and, making, way, (_qualis, est, via, navis, in, mari_, which, the, french, calleth, _sourdes, menées_, when, men, set, things, in, work, without, opening, themselves, at, all), be, sometimes, both, prosperous, and, admirable, yet, many, times, _dissimulatio, errores, parit_, _qui, dissimulatorem, ipsum, illaqueant_, and, therefore, we, see, the, greatest, politiques, have, in, a, natural, and, free, manner, professed, their, desires, rather, than, been, reserved, and, disguised, in, them, for, so, we, see, that, lucius, sylla, made, a, kind, of, profession, “that, he, wished, all, men, happy, or, unhappy, as, they, stood, his, friends, or, enemies, ”, so, cæsar, when, he, went, first, into, gaul, made, no, scruple, to, profess, “that, he, had, rather, be, first, in, a, village, than, second, at, rome, ”, so, again, as, soon, as, he, had, begun, the, war, we, see, what, cicero, saith, of, him, _alter_, (meaning, of, cæsar), _non, recusat_, _sed, quodammodo, postulat_, _ut_, (_ut, est_), _sic, appelletur, tyrannus_, so, we, may, see, in, a, letter, of, cicero, to, atticus, that, augustus, cæsar, in, his, very, entrance, into, affairs, when, he, was, a, darling, of, the, senate, yet, in, his, harangues, to, the, people, would, swear, _ita, parentis, honores, consequi, liceat_, (which, was, no, less, than, the, tyranny), save, that, to, help, it, he, would, stretch, forth, his, hand, towards, a, statue, of, cæsar’s, that, was, erected, in, the, place, and, men, laughed, and, wondered, and, said, “is, it, possible, ”, or, “did, you, ever, hear, the, like, ”, and, yet, thought, he, meant, no, hurt, he, did, it, so, handsomely, and, ingenuously, and, all, these, were, prosperous, whereas, pompey, who, tended, to, the, same, ends, but, in, a, more, dark, and, dissembling, manner, as, tacitus, saith, of, him, _occultior, non, melior_, wherein, sallust, concurreth, _ore, probo_, _animo, inverecundo_, made, it, his, design, by, infinite, secret, engines, to, cast, the, state, into, an, absolute, anarchy, and, confusion, that, the, state, might, cast, itself, into, his, arms, for, necessity, and, protection, and, so, the, sovereign, power, be, put, upon, him, and, he, never, seen, in, it, and, when, he, had, brought, it, (as, he, thought), to, that, point, when, he, was, chosen, consul, alone, as, never, any, was, yet, he, could, make, no, great, matter, of, it, because, men, understood, him, not, but, was, fain, in, the, end, to, go, the, beaten, track, of, getting, arms, into, his, hands, by, colour, of, the, doubt, of, cæsar’s, designs, so, tedious, casual, and, unfortunate, are, these, deep, dissimulations, whereof, it, seemeth, tacitus, made, this, judgment, that, they, were, a, cunning, of, an, inferior, form, in, regard, of, true, policy, attributing, the, one, to, augustus, the, other, to, tiberius, where, speaking, of, livia, he, saith, _et, cum, artibus, mariti, simulatione, filii, bene, compostia_, for, surely, the, continual, habit, of, dissimulation, is, but, a, weak, and, sluggish, cunning, and, not, greatly, politic, (37), another, precept, of, this, architecture, of, fortune, is, to, accustom, our, minds, to, judge, of, the, proportion, or, value, of, things, as, they, conduce, and, are, material, to, our, particular, ends, and, that, to, do, substantially, and, not, superficially, for, we, shall, find, the, logical, part, (as, may, term, it), of, some, men’s, minds, good, but, the, mathematical, part, erroneous, that, is, they, can, well, judge, of, consequences, but, not, of, proportions, and, comparison, preferring, things, of, show, and, sense, before, things, of, substance, and, effect, so, some, fall, in, love, with, access, to, princes, others, with, popular, fame, and, applause, supposing, they, are, things, of, great, purchase, when, in, many, cases, they, are, but, matters, of, envy, peril, and, impediment, so, some, measure, things, according, to, the, labour, and, difficulty, or, assiduity, which, are, spent, about, them, and, think, if, they, be, ever, moving, that, they, must, needs, advance, and, proceed, as, cæsar, saith, in, a, despising, manner, of, cato, the, second, when, he, describeth, how, laborious, and, indefatigable, he, was, to, no, great, purpose, _hæc, omnia, magno, studio, agebat_, so, in, most, things, men, are, ready, to, abuse, themselves, in, thinking, the, greatest, means, to, be, best, when, it, should, be, the, fittest, (38), as, for, the, true, marshalling, of, men’s, pursuits, towards, their, fortune, as, they, are, more, or, less, material, hold, them, to, stand, thus, first, the, amendment, of, their, own, minds, for, the, removal, of, the, impediments, of, the, mind, will, sooner, clear, the, passages, of, fortune, than, the, obtaining, fortune, will, remove, the, impediments, of, the, mind, in, the, second, place, set, down, wealth, and, means, which, know, most, men, would, have, placed, first, because, of, the, general, use, which, it, beareth, towards, all, variety, of, occasions, but, that, opinion, may, condemn, with, like, reason, as, machiavel, doth, that, other, that, moneys, were, the, sinews, of, the, wars, whereas, (saith, he), the, true, sinews, of, the, wars, are, the, sinews, of, men’s, arms, that, is, a, valiant, populous, and, military, nation, and, he, voucheth, aptly, the, authority, of, solon, who, when, crœsus, showed, him, his, treasury, of, gold, said, to, him, that, if, another, came, that, had, better, iron, he, would, be, master, of, his, gold, in, like, manner, it, may, be, truly, affirmed, that, it, is, not, moneys, that, are, the, sinews, of, fortune, but, it, is, the, sinews, and, steel, of, men’s, minds, wit, courage, audacity, resolution, temper, industry, and, the, like, in, the, third, place, set, down, reputation, because, of, the, peremptory, tides, and, currents, it, hath, which, if, they, be, not, taken, in, their, due, time, are, seldom, recovered, it, being, extreme, hard, to, play, an, after-game, of, reputation, and, lastly, place, honour, which, is, more, easily, won, by, any, of, the, other, three, much, more, by, all, than, any, of, them, can, be, purchased, by, honour, to, conclude, this, precept, as, there, is, order, and, priority, in, matter, so, is, there, in, time, the, preposterous, placing, whereof, is, one, of, the, commonest, errors, while, men, fly, to, their, ends, when, they, should, intend, their, beginnings, and, do, not, take, things, in, order, of, time, as, they, come, on, but, marshal, them, according, to, greatness, and, not, according, to, instance, not, observing, the, good, precept, _quod, nunc, instat, agamus_, (39), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, is, not, to, embrace, any, matters, which, do, occupy, too, great, a, quantity, of, time, but, to, have, that, sounding, in, a, man’s, ears, _sed, fugit, interea, fugit, irreparabile, tempus_, and, that, is, the, cause, why, those, which, take, their, course, of, rising, by, professions, of, burden, as, lawyers, orators, painful, divines, and, the, like, are, not, commonly, so, politic, for, their, own, fortune, otherwise, than, in, their, ordinary, way, because, they, want, time, to, learn, particulars, to, wait, occasions, and, to, devise, plots, (40), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, is, to, imitate, nature, which, doth, nothing, in, vain, which, surely, a, man, may, do, if, he, do, well, interlace, his, business, and, bend, not, his, mind, too, much, upon, that, which, he, principally, intendeth, for, a, man, ought, in, every, particular, action, so, to, carry, the, motions, of, his, mind, and, so, to, have, one, thing, under, another, as, if, he, cannot, have, that, he, seeketh, in, the, best, degree, yet, to, have, it, in, a, second, or, so, in, a, third, and, if, he, can, have, no, part, of, that, which, he, purposed, yet, to, turn, the, use, of, it, to, somewhat, else, and, if, he, cannot, make, anything, of, it, for, the, present, yet, to, make, it, as, a, seed, of, somewhat, in, time, to, come, and, if, he, can, contrive, no, effect, or, substance, from, it, yet, to, win, some, good, opinion, by, it, or, the, like, so, that, he, should, exact, an, account, of, himself, of, every, action, to, reap, somewhat, and, not, to, stand, amazed, and, confused, if, he, fail, of, that, he, chiefly, meant, for, nothing, is, more, impolitic, than, to, mind, actions, wholly, one, by, one, for, he, that, doth, so, loseth, infinite, occasions, which, intervene, and, are, many, times, more, proper, and, propitious, for, somewhat, that, he, shall, need, afterwards, than, for, that, which, he, urgeth, for, the, present, and, therefore, men, must, be, perfect, in, that, rule, _hæc, oportet, facere_, _et, illa, non, imittere_, (41), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, is, not, to, engage, a, man’s, self, peremptorily, in, anything, though, it, seem, not, liable, to, accident, but, ever, to, have, a, window, to, fly, out, at, or, a, way, to, retire, following, the, wisdom, in, the, ancient, fable, of, the, two, frogs, which, consulted, when, their, plash, was, dry, whither, they, should, go, and, the, one, moved, to, go, down, into, a, pit, because, it, was, not, likely, the, water, would, dry, there, but, the, other, answered, “true, but, if, it, do, how, shall, we, get, out, again, ”, (42), another, precept, of, this, knowledge, is, that, ancient, precept, of, bias, construed, not, to, any, point, of, perfidiousness, but, to, caution, and, moderation, _et, ama, tanquam, inimicus, futurus, et, odi, tanquam, amaturus_, for, it, utterly, betrayeth, all, utility, for, men, to, embark, themselves, too, far, into, unfortunate, friendships, troublesome, spleens, and, childish, and, humorous, envies, or, emulations, (43), but, continue, this, beyond, the, measure, of, an, example, led, because, would, not, have, such, knowledges, which, note, as, deficient, to, be, thought, things, imaginative, or, in, the, air, or, an, observation, or, two, much, made, of, but, things, of, bulk, and, mass, whereof, an, end, is, more, hardly, made, than, a, beginning, it, must, be, likewise, conceived, that, in, these, points, which, mention, and, set, down, they, are, far, from, complete, tractates, of, them, but, only, as, small, pieces, for, patterns, and, lastly, no, man, suppose, will, think, that, mean, fortunes, are, not, obtained, without, all, this, ado, for, know, they, come, tumbling, into, some, men’s, laps, and, a, number, obtain, good, fortunes, by, diligence, in, a, plain, way, little, intermeddling, and, keeping, themselves, from, gross, errors, (44), but, as, cicero, when, he, setteth, down, an, idea, of, a, perfect, orator, doth, not, mean, that, every, pleader, should, be, such, and, so, likewise, when, a, prince, or, a, courtier, hath, been, described, by, such, as, have, handled, those, subjects, the, mould, hath, used, to, be, made, according, to, the, perfection, of, the, art, and, not, according, to, common, practice, so, understand, it, that, it, ought, to, be, done, in, the, description, of, a, politic, man, mean, politic, for, his, own, fortune, (45), but, it, must, be, remembered, all, this, while, that, the, precepts, which, we, have, set, down, are, of, that, kind, which, may, be, counted, and, called, _bonæ, artes_, as, for, evil, arts, if, a, man, would, set, down, for, himself, that, principle, of, machiavel, “that, a, man, seek, not, to, attain, virtue, itself, but, the, appearance, only, thereof, because, the, credit, of, virtue, is, a, help, but, the, use, of, it, is, cumber, ”, or, that, other, of, his, principles, “that, he, presuppose, that, men, are, not, fitly, to, be, wrought, otherwise, but, by, fear, and, therefore, that, he, seek, to, have, every, man, obnoxious, low, and, in, straits, ”, which, the, italians, call, _seminar, spine_, to, sow, thorns, or, that, other, principle, contained, in, the, verse, which, cicero, citeth, _cadant, amici_, _dummodo, inimici, intercidant_, as, the, triumvirs, which, sold, every, one, to, other, the, lives, of, their, friends, for, the, deaths, of, their, enemies, or, that, other, protestation, of, catilina, to, set, on, fire, and, trouble, states, to, the, end, to, fish, in, droumy, waters, and, to, unwrap, their, fortunes, _ego, si, quid, in, fortunis, meis, excitatum, sit, incendium_, _id, non, aqua, sed, ruina, restinguam_, or, that, other, principle, of, lysander, “that, children, are, to, be, deceived, with, comfits, and, men, with, oaths, ”, and, the, like, evil, and, corrupt, positions, whereof, (as, in, all, things), there, are, more, in, number, than, of, the, good, certainly, with, these, dispensations, from, the, laws, of, charity, and, integrity, the, pressing, of, a, man’s, fortune, may, be, more, hasty, and, compendious, but, it, is, in, life, as, it, is, in, ways, the, shortest, way, is, commonly, the, foulest, and, surely, the, fairer, way, is, not, much, about, (46), but, men, if, they, be, in, their, own, power, and, do, bear, and, sustain, themselves, and, be, not, carried, away, with, a, whirlwind, or, tempest, of, ambition, ought, in, the, pursuit, of, their, own, fortune, to, set, before, their, eyes, not, only, that, general, map, of, the, world, “that, all, things, are, vanity, and, vexation, of, spirit, ”, but, many, other, more, particular, cards, and, directions, chiefly, that, that, being, without, well-being, is, a, curse, and, the, greater, being, the, greater, curse, and, that, all, virtue, is, most, rewarded, and, all, wickedness, most, punished, in, itself, according, as, the, poet, saith, excellently, “quæ, vobis, quæ, digna, viri, pro, laudibus, istis, præmia, posse, rear, solvi, pulcherrima, primum, dii, _moresque_, dabunt, vestri, ”, and, so, of, the, contrary, and, secondly, they, ought, to, look, up, to, the, eternal, providence, and, divine, judgment, which, often, subverteth, the, wisdom, of, evil, plots, and, imaginations, according, to, that, scripture, “he, hath, conceived, mischief, and, shall, bring, forth, a, vain, thing, ”, and, although, men, should, refrain, themselves, from, injury, and, evil, arts, yet, this, incessant, and, sabbathless, pursuit, of, a, man’s, fortune, leaveth, not, tribute, which, we, owe, to, god, of, our, time, who, (we, see), demandeth, a, tenth, of, our, substance, and, a, seventh, which, is, more, strict, of, our, time, and, it, is, to, small, purpose, to, have, an, erected, face, towards, heaven, and, a, perpetual, grovelling, spirit, upon, earth, eating, dust, as, doth, the, serpent, _atque, affigit, humo, divinæ, particulam, auræ_, and, if, any, man, flatter, himself, that, he, will, employ, his, fortune, well, though, he, should, obtain, it, ill, as, was, said, concerning, augustus, cæsar, and, after, of, septimius, severus, “that, either, they, should, never, have, been, born, or, else, they, should, never, have, died, ”, they, did, so, much, mischief, in, the, pursuit, and, ascent, of, their, greatness, and, so, much, good, when, they, were, established, yet, these, compensations, and, satisfactions, are, good, to, be, used, but, never, good, to, be, purposed, and, lastly, it, is, not, amiss, for, men, in, their, race, towards, their, fortune, to, cool, themselves, a, little, with, that, conceit, which, is, elegantly, expressed, by, the, emperor, charles, in, his, instructions, to, the, king, his, son, “that, fortune, hath, somewhat, of, the, nature, of, a, woman, that, if, she, he, too, much, wooed, she, is, the, farther, off, ”, but, this, last, is, but, a, remedy, for, those, whose, tastes, are, corrupted, let, men, rather, build, upon, that, foundation, which, is, as, a, corner-stone, of, divinity, and, philosophy, wherein, they, join, close, namely, that, same, _primum, quærite_, for, divinity, saith, _primum, quærite, regnum, dei_, _et, ista, omnia, adjicientur, vobis_, and, philosophy, saith, _primum, quærite, bona, animi_, _cætera, aut, aderunt_, _aut, non, oberunt_, and, although, the, human, foundation, hath, somewhat, of, the, sands, as, we, see, in, brutus, when, he, broke, forth, into, that, speech, “te, colui, (virtus), ut, rem, ast, tu, nomen, inane, es, ”, yet, the, divine, foundation, is, upon, the, rock, but, this, may, serve, for, a, taste, of, that, knowledge, which, noted, as, deficient, (47), concerning, government, it, is, a, part, of, knowledge, secret, and, retired, in, both, these, respects, in, which, things, are, deemed, secret, for, some, things, are, secret, because, they, are, hard, to, know, and, some, because, they, are, not, fit, to, utter, we, see, all, governments, are, obscure, and, invisible, “totamque, infusa, per, artus, mens, agitat, molem, et, magno, se, corpore, miscet, ”, such, is, the, description, of, governments, we, see, the, government, of, god, over, the, world, is, hidden, insomuch, as, it, seemeth, to, participate, of, much, irregularity, and, confusion, the, government, of, the, soul, in, moving, the, body, is, inward, and, profound, and, the, passages, thereof, hardly, to, be, reduced, to, demonstration, again, the, wisdom, of, antiquity, (the, shadows, whereof, are, in, the, poets), in, the, description, of, torments, and, pains, next, unto, the, crime, of, rebellion, which, was, the, giants’, offence, doth, detest, the, offence, of, futility, as, in, sisyphus, and, tantalus, but, this, was, meant, of, particulars, nevertheless, even, unto, the, general, rules, and, discourses, of, policy, and, government, there, is, due, a, reverent, and, reserved, handling, (48), but, contrariwise, in, the, governors, towards, the, governed, all, things, ought, as, far, as, the, frailty, of, man, permitteth, to, be, manifest, and, revealed, for, so, it, is, expressed, in, the, scriptures, touching, the, government, of, god, that, this, globe, which, seemeth, to, us, a, dark, and, shady, body, is, in, the, view, of, god, as, crystal, _et, in, conspectu, sedis, tanquam, mare, vitreum, simile, crystallo_, so, unto, princes, and, states, and, specially, towards, wise, senates, and, councils, the, natures, and, dispositions, of, the, people, their, conditions, and, necessities, their, factions, and, combinations, their, animosities, and, discontents, ought, to, be, in, regard, of, the, variety, of, their, intelligences, the, wisdom, of, their, observations, and, the, height, of, their, station, where, they, keep, sentinel, in, great, part, clear, and, transparent, wherefore, considering, that, write, to, a, king, that, is, a, master, of, this, science, and, is, so, well, assisted, think, it, decent, to, pass, over, this, part, in, silence, as, willing, to, obtain, the, certificate, which, one, of, the, ancient, philosophers, aspired, unto, who, being, silent, when, others, contended, to, make, demonstration, of, their, abilities, by, speech, desired, it, might, be, certified, for, his, part, “that, there, was, one, that, knew, how, to, hold, his, peace, ”, (49), notwithstanding, for, the, more, public, part, of, government, which, is, laws, think, good, to, note, only, one, deficiency, which, is, that, all, those, which, have, written, of, laws, have, written, either, as, philosophers, or, as, lawyers, and, none, as, statesmen, as, for, the, philosophers, they, make, imaginary, laws, for, imaginary, commonwealths, and, their, discourses, are, as, the, stars, which, give, little, light, because, they, are, so, high, for, the, lawyers, they, write, according, to, the, states, where, they, live, what, is, received, law, and, not, what, ought, to, be, law, for, the, wisdom, of, a, law-maker, is, one, and, of, a, lawyer, is, another, for, there, are, in, nature, certain, fountains, of, justice, whence, all, civil, laws, are, derived, but, as, streams, and, like, as, waters, do, take, tinctures, and, tastes, from, the, soils, through, which, they, run, so, do, civil, laws, vary, according, to, the, regions, and, governments, where, they, are, planted, though, they, proceed, from, the, same, fountains, again, the, wisdom, of, a, law-maker, consisteth, not, only, in, a, platform, of, justice, but, in, the, application, thereof, taking, into, consideration, by, what, means, laws, may, be, made, certain, and, what, are, the, causes, and, remedies, of, the, doubtfulness, and, uncertainty, of, law, by, what, means, laws, may, be, made, apt, and, easy, to, be, executed, and, what, are, the, impediments, and, remedies, in, the, execution, of, laws, what, influence, laws, touching, private, right, of, _meum_, and, _tuum_, have, into, the, public, state, and, how, they, may, be, made, apt, and, agreeable, how, laws, are, to, be, penned, and, delivered, whether, in, texts, or, in, acts, brief, or, large, with, preambles, or, without, how, they, are, to, be, pruned, and, reformed, from, time, to, time, and, what, is, the, best, means, to, keep, them, from, being, too, vast, in, volume, or, too, full, of, multiplicity, and, crossness, how, they, are, to, be, expounded, when, upon, causes, emergent, and, judicially, discussed, and, when, upon, responses, and, conferences, touching, general, points, or, questions, how, they, are, to, be, pressed, rigorously, or, tenderly, how, they, are, to, be, mitigated, by, equity, and, good, conscience, and, whether, discretion, and, strict, law, are, to, be, mingled, in, the, same, courts, or, kept, apart, in, several, courts, again, how, the, practice, profession, and, erudition, of, law, is, to, be, censured, and, governed, and, many, other, points, touching, the, administration, and, (as, may, term, it), animation, of, laws, upon, which, insist, the, less, because, purpose, (if, god, give, me, leave), having, begun, a, work, of, this, nature, in, aphorisms, to, propound, it, hereafter, noting, it, in, the, meantime, for, deficient, (50), and, for, your, majesty’s, laws, of, england, could, say, much, of, their, dignity, and, somewhat, of, their, defect, but, they, cannot, but, excel, the, civil, laws, in, fitness, for, the, government, for, the, civil, law, was, _nonhos, quæsitum, munus, in, usus_, it, was, not, made, for, the, countries, which, it, governeth, hereof, cease, to, speak, because, will, not, intermingle, matter, of, action, with, matter, of, general, learning, thus, have, concluded, this, portion, of, learning, touching, civil, knowledge, and, with, civil, knowledge, have, concluded, human, philosophy, and, with, human, philosophy, philosophy, in, general, and, being, now, at, some, pause, looking, back, into, that, have, passed, through, this, writing, seemeth, to, me, (_si, nunquam, fallit, imago_), as, far, as, a, man, can, judge, of, his, own, work, not, much, better, than, that, noise, or, sound, which, musicians, make, while, they, are, in, tuning, their, instruments, which, is, nothing, pleasant, to, hear, but, yet, is, a, cause, why, the, music, is, sweeter, afterwards, so, have, been, content, to, tune, the, instruments, of, the, muses, that, they, may, play, that, have, better, hands, and, surely, when, set, before, me, the, condition, of, these, times, in, which, learning, hath, made, her, third, visitation, or, circuit, in, all, the, qualities, thereof, as, the, excellency, and, vivacity, of, the, wits, of, this, age, the, noble, helps, and, lights, which, we, have, by, the, travails, of, ancient, writers, the, art, of, printing, which, communicateth, books, to, men, of, all, fortunes, the, openness, of, the, world, by, navigation, which, hath, disclosed, multitudes, of, experiments, and, a, mass, of, natural, history, the, leisure, wherewith, these, times, abound, not, employing, men, so, generally, in, civil, business, as, the, states, of, græcia, did, in, respect, of, their, popularity, and, the, state, of, rome, in, respect, of, the, greatness, of, their, monarchy, the, present, disposition, of, these, times, at, this, instant, to, peace, the, consumption, of, all, that, ever, can, be, said, in, controversies, of, religion, which, have, so, much, diverted, men, from, other, sciences, the, perfection, of, your, majesty’s, learning, which, as, a, phœnix, may, call, whole, volleys, of, wits, to, follow, you, and, the, inseparable, propriety, of, time, which, is, ever, more, and, more, to, disclose, truth, cannot, but, be, raised, to, this, persuasion, that, this, third, period, of, time, will, far, surpass, that, of, the, grecian, and, roman, learning, only, if, men, will, know, their, own, strength, and, their, own, weakness, both, and, take, one, from, the, other, light, of, invention, and, not, fire, of, contradiction, and, esteem, of, the, inquisition, of, truth, as, of, an, enterprise, and, not, as, of, a, quality, or, ornament, and, employ, wit, and, magnificence, to, things, of, worth, and, excellency, and, not, to, things, vulgar, and, of, popular, estimation, as, for, my, labours, if, any, man, shall, please, himself, or, others, in, the, reprehension, of, them, they, shall, make, that, ancient, and, patient, request, _verbera_, _sed, audi_, let, men, reprehend, them, so, they, observe, and, weigh, them, for, the, appeal, is, lawful, (though, it, may, be, it, shall, not, be, needful), from, the, first, cogitations, of, men, to, their, second, and, from, the, nearer, times, to, the, times, further, off, now, let, us, come, to, that, learning, which, both, the, former, times, were, not, so, blessed, as, to, know, sacred, and, inspired, divinity, the, sabbath, and, port, of, all, men’s, labours, and, peregrinations, (1), the, prerogative, of, god, extendeth, as, well, to, the, reason, as, to, the, will, of, man, so, that, as, we, are, to, obey, his, law, though, we, find, a, reluctation, in, our, will, so, we, are, to, believe, his, word, though, we, find, a, reluctation, in, our, reason, for, if, we, believe, only, that, which, is, agreeable, to, our, sense, we, give, consent, to, the, matter, and, not, to, the, author, which, is, no, more, than, we, would, do, towards, a, suspected, and, discredited, witness, but, that, faith, which, was, accounted, to, abraham, for, righteousness, was, of, such, a, point, as, whereat, sarah, laughed, who, therein, was, an, image, of, natural, reason, (2), howbeit, (if, we, will, truly, consider, of, it), more, worthy, it, is, to, believe, than, to, know, as, we, now, know, for, in, knowledge, man’s, mind, suffereth, from, sense, but, in, belief, it, suffereth, from, spirit, such, one, as, it, holdeth, for, more, authorised, than, itself, and, so, suffereth, from, the, worthier, agent, otherwise, it, is, of, the, state, of, man, glorified, for, then, faith, shall, cease, and, we, shall, know, as, we, are, known, (3), wherefore, we, conclude, that, sacred, theology, (which, in, our, idiom, we, call, divinity), is, grounded, only, upon, the, word, and, oracle, of, god, and, not, upon, the, light, of, nature, for, it, is, written, _cæli, enarrant, gloriam, dei_, but, it, is, not, written, _cæli, enarrant, voluntatem, dei_, but, of, that, it, is, said, _ad, legem, et, testimonium_, _si, non, fecerint, secundum, verbum, istud_, &c, this, holdeth, not, only, in, those, points, of, faith, which, concern, the, great, mysteries, of, the, deity, of, the, creation, of, the, redemption, but, likewise, those, which, concern, the, law, moral, truly, interpreted, “love, your, enemies, do, good, to, them, that, hate, you, be, like, to, your, heavenly, father, that, suffereth, his, rain, to, fall, upon, the, just, and, unjust, ”, to, this, it, ought, to, be, applauded, _nec, vox, hominem, sonat_, it, is, a, voice, beyond, the, light, of, nature, so, we, see, the, heathen, poets, when, they, fall, upon, a, libertine, passion, do, still, expostulate, with, laws, and, moralities, as, if, they, were, opposite, and, malignant, to, nature, _et, quod, natura, remittit_, _invida, jura, negant_, so, said, dendamis, the, indian, unto, alexander’s, messengers, that, he, had, heard, somewhat, of, pythagoras, and, some, other, of, the, wise, men, of, græcia, and, that, he, held, them, for, excellent, men, but, that, they, had, a, fault, which, was, that, they, had, in, too, great, reverence, and, veneration, a, thing, they, called, law, and, manners, so, it, must, be, confessed, that, a, great, part, of, the, law, moral, is, of, that, perfection, whereunto, the, light, of, nature, cannot, aspire, how, then, is, it, that, man, is, said, to, have, by, the, light, and, law, of, nature, some, notions, and, conceits, of, virtue, and, vice, justice, and, wrong, good, and, evil, thus, because, the, light, of, nature, is, used, in, two, several, senses, the, one, that, which, springeth, from, reason, sense, induction, argument, according, to, the, laws, of, heaven, and, earth, the, other, that, which, is, imprinted, upon, the, spirit, of, man, by, an, inward, instinct, according, to, the, law, of, conscience, which, is, a, sparkle, of, the, purity, of, his, first, estate, in, which, latter, sense, only, he, is, participant, of, some, light, and, discerning, touching, the, perfection, of, the, moral, law, but, how, sufficient, to, check, the, vice, but, not, to, inform, the, duty, so, then, the, doctrine, of, religion, as, well, moral, as, mystical, is, not, to, be, attained, but, by, inspiration, and, revelation, from, god, (4), the, use, notwithstanding, of, reason, in, spiritual, things, and, the, latitude, thereof, is, very, great, and, general, for, it, is, not, for, nothing, that, the, apostle, calleth, religion, “our, reasonable, service, of, god, ”, insomuch, as, the, very, ceremonies, and, figures, of, the, old, law, were, full, of, reason, and, signification, much, more, than, the, ceremonies, of, idolatry, and, magic, that, are, full, of, non-significants, and, surd, characters, but, most, specially, the, christian, faith, as, in, all, things, so, in, this, deserveth, to, be, highly, magnified, holding, and, preserving, the, golden, mediocrity, in, this, point, between, the, law, of, the, heathen, and, the, law, of, mahomet, which, have, embraced, the, two, extremes, for, the, religion, of, the, heathen, had, no, constant, belief, or, confession, but, left, all, to, the, liberty, of, agent, and, the, religion, of, mahomet, on, the, other, side, interdicteth, argument, altogether, the, one, having, the, very, face, of, error, and, the, other, of, imposture, whereas, the, faith, doth, both, admit, and, reject, disputation, with, difference, (5), the, use, of, human, reason, in, religion, is, of, two, sorts, the, former, in, the, conception, and, apprehension, of, the, mysteries, of, god, to, us, revealed, the, other, in, the, inferring, and, deriving, of, doctrine, and, direction, thereupon, the, former, extendeth, to, the, mysteries, themselves, but, how, by, way, of, illustration, and, not, by, way, of, argument, the, latter, consisteth, indeed, of, probation, and, argument, in, the, former, we, see, god, vouchsafeth, to, descend, to, our, capacity, in, the, expressing, of, his, mysteries, in, sort, as, may, be, sensible, unto, us, and, doth, graft, his, revelations, and, holy, doctrine, upon, the, notions, of, our, reason, and, applieth, his, inspirations, to, open, our, understanding, as, the, form, of, the, key, to, the, ward, of, the, lock, for, the, latter, there, is, allowed, us, a, use, of, reason, and, argument, secondary, and, respective, although, not, original, and, absolute, for, after, the, articles, and, principles, of, religion, are, placed, and, exempted, from, examination, of, reason, it, is, then, permitted, unto, us, to, make, derivations, and, inferences, from, and, according, to, the, analogy, of, them, for, our, better, direction, in, nature, this, holdeth, not, for, both, the, principles, are, examinable, by, induction, though, not, by, a, medium, or, syllogism, and, besides, those, principles, or, first, positions, have, no, discordance, with, that, reason, which, draweth, down, and, deduceth, the, inferior, positions, but, yet, it, holdeth, not, in, religion, alone, but, in, many, knowledges, both, of, greater, and, smaller, nature, namely, wherein, there, are, not, only, _posita_, but, _placita_, for, in, such, there, can, be, no, use, of, absolute, reason, we, see, it, familiarly, in, games, of, wit, as, chess, or, the, like, the, draughts, and, first, laws, of, the, game, are, positive, but, how, merely, _ad, placitum_, and, not, examinable, by, reason, but, then, how, to, direct, our, play, thereupon, with, best, advantage, to, win, the, game, is, artificial, and, rational, so, in, human, laws, there, be, many, grounds, and, maxims, which, are, _placita, juris_, positive, upon, authority, and, not, upon, reason, and, therefore, not, to, be, disputed, but, what, is, most, just, not, absolutely, but, relatively, and, according, to, those, maxims, that, affordeth, a, long, field, of, disputation, such, therefore, is, that, secondary, reason, which, hath, place, in, divinity, which, is, grounded, upon, the, _placets_, of, god, (6), here, therefore, note, this, deficiency, that, there, hath, not, been, to, my, understanding, sufficiently, inquired, and, handled, the, true, limits, and, use, of, reason, in, spiritual, things, as, a, kind, of, divine, dialectic, which, for, that, it, is, not, done, it, seemeth, to, me, a, thing, usual, by, pretext, of, true, conceiving, that, which, is, revealed, to, search, and, mine, into, that, which, is, not, revealed, and, by, pretext, of, enucleating, inferences, and, contradictories, to, examine, that, which, is, positive, the, one, sort, falling, into, the, error, of, nicodemus, demanding, to, have, things, made, more, sensible, than, it, pleaseth, god, to, reveal, them, _quomodo, possit, homo, nasci, cum, sit, senex_, the, other, sort, into, the, error, of, the, disciples, which, were, scandalised, at, a, show, of, contradiction, _quid, est, hoc, quod, dicit, nobis_, _modicum, et, non, videbitis, me_, _et, iterum_, _modicum_, _et, videbitis, me_, &c, (7), upon, this, have, insisted, the, more, in, regard, of, the, great, and, blessed, use, thereof, for, this, point, well, laboured, and, defined, of, would, in, my, judgment, be, an, opiate, to, stay, and, bridle, not, only, the, vanity, of, curious, speculations, wherewith, the, schools, labour, but, the, fury, of, controversies, wherewith, the, church, laboureth, for, it, cannot, but, open, men’s, eyes, to, see, that, many, controversies, do, merely, pertain, to, that, which, is, either, not, revealed, or, positive, and, that, many, others, do, grow, upon, weak, and, obscure, inferences, or, derivations, which, latter, sort, if, men, would, revive, the, blessed, style, of, that, great, doctor, of, the, gentiles, would, be, carried, thus, _ego_, _non, dominus_, and, again, _secundum, consilium, meum_, in, opinions, and, counsels, and, not, in, positions, and, oppositions, but, men, are, now, over-ready, to, usurp, the, style, _non, ego_, _sed, dominus_, and, not, so, only, but, to, bind, it, with, the, thunder, and, denunciation, of, curses, and, anathemas, to, the, terror, of, those, which, have, not, sufficiently, learned, out, of, solomon, that, “the, causeless, curse, shall, not, come, ”, (8), divinity, hath, two, principal, parts, the, matter, informed, or, revealed, and, the, nature, of, the, information, or, revelation, and, with, the, latter, we, will, begin, because, it, hath, most, coherence, with, that, which, we, have, now, last, handled, the, nature, of, the, information, consisteth, of, three, branches, the, limits, of, the, information, the, sufficiency, of, the, information, and, the, acquiring, or, obtaining, the, information, unto, the, limits, of, the, information, belong, these, considerations, how, far, forth, particular, persons, continue, to, be, inspired, how, far, forth, the, church, is, inspired, and, how, far, forth, reason, may, be, used, the, last, point, whereof, have, noted, as, deficient, unto, the, sufficiency, of, the, information, belong, two, considerations, what, points, of, religion, are, fundamental, and, what, perfective, being, matter, of, further, building, and, perfection, upon, one, and, the, same, foundation, and, again, how, the, gradations, of, light, according, to, the, dispensation, of, times, are, material, to, the, sufficiency, of, belief, (9), here, again, may, rather, give, it, in, advice, than, note, it, as, deficient, that, the, points, fundamental, and, the, points, of, further, perfection, only, ought, to, be, with, piety, and, wisdom, distinguished, a, subject, tending, to, much, like, end, as, that, noted, before, for, as, that, other, were, likely, to, abate, the, number, of, controversies, so, this, is, likely, to, abate, the, heat, of, many, of, them, we, see, moses, when, he, saw, the, israelite, and, the, egyptian, fight, he, did, not, say, “why, strive, you, ”, but, drew, his, sword, and, slew, the, egyptian, but, when, he, saw, the, two, israelites, fight, he, said, “you, are, brethren, why, strive, you, ”, if, the, point, of, doctrine, be, an, egyptian, it, must, be, slain, by, the, sword, of, the, spirit, and, not, reconciled, but, if, it, be, an, israelite, though, in, the, wrong, then, “why, strive, you, ”, we, see, of, the, fundamental, points, our, saviour, penneth, the, league, thus, “he, that, is, not, with, us, is, against, us, ”, but, of, points, not, fundamental, thus, “he, that, is, not, against, us, is, with, us, ”, so, we, see, the, coat, of, our, saviour, was, entire, without, seam, and, so, is, the, doctrine, of, the, scriptures, in, itself, but, the, garment, of, the, church, was, of, divers, colours, and, yet, not, divided, we, see, the, chaff, may, and, ought, to, be, severed, from, the, corn, in, the, ear, but, the, tares, may, not, be, pulled, up, from, the, corn, in, the, field, so, as, it, is, a, thing, of, great, use, well, to, define, what, and, of, what, latitude, those, points, are, which, do, make, men, mere, aliens, and, disincorporate, from, the, church, of, god, (10), for, the, obtaining, of, the, information, it, resteth, upon, the, true, and, sound, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, which, are, the, fountains, of, the, water, of, life, the, interpretations, of, the, scriptures, are, of, two, sorts, methodical, and, solute, or, at, large, for, this, divine, water, which, excelleth, so, much, that, of, jacob’s, well, is, drawn, forth, much, in, the, same, kind, as, natural, water, useth, to, be, out, of, wells, and, fountains, either, it, is, first, forced, up, into, a, cistern, and, from, thence, fetched, and, derived, for, use, or, else, it, is, drawn, and, received, in, buckets, and, vessels, immediately, where, it, springeth, the, former, sort, whereof, though, it, seem, to, be, the, more, ready, yet, in, my, judgment, is, more, subject, to, corrupt, this, is, that, method, which, hath, exhibited, unto, us, the, scholastical, divinity, whereby, divinity, hath, been, reduced, into, an, art, as, into, a, cistern, and, the, streams, of, doctrine, or, positions, fetched, and, derived, from, thence, (11), in, this, men, have, sought, three, things, a, summary, brevity, a, compacted, strength, and, a, complete, perfection, whereof, the, two, first, they, fail, to, find, and, the, last, they, ought, not, to, seek, for, as, to, brevity, we, see, in, all, summary, methods, while, men, purpose, to, abridge, they, give, cause, to, dilate, for, the, sum, or, abridgment, by, contraction, becometh, obscure, the, obscurity, requireth, exposition, and, the, exposition, is, deduced, into, large, commentaries, or, into, commonplaces, and, titles, which, grow, to, be, more, vast, than, the, original, writings, whence, the, sum, was, at, first, extracted, so, we, see, the, volumes, of, the, schoolmen, are, greater, much, than, the, first, writings, of, the, fathers, whence, the, master, of, the, sentences, made, his, sum, or, collection, so, in, like, manner, the, volumes, of, the, modern, doctors, of, the, civil, law, exceed, those, of, the, ancient, jurisconsults, of, which, tribonian, compiled, the, digest, so, as, this, course, of, sums, and, commentaries, is, that, which, doth, infallibly, make, the, body, of, sciences, more, immense, in, quantity, and, more, base, in, substance, (12), and, for, strength, it, is, true, that, knowledges, reduced, into, exact, methods, have, a, show, of, strength, in, that, each, part, seemeth, to, support, and, sustain, the, other, but, this, is, more, satisfactory, than, substantial, like, unto, buildings, which, stand, by, architecture, and, compaction, which, are, more, subject, to, ruin, than, those, that, are, built, more, strong, in, their, several, parts, though, less, compacted, but, it, is, plain, that, the, more, you, recede, from, your, grounds, the, weaker, do, you, conclude, and, as, in, nature, the, more, you, remove, yourself, from, particulars, the, greater, peril, of, error, you, do, incur, so, much, more, in, divinity, the, more, you, recede, from, the, scriptures, by, inferences, and, consequences, the, more, weak, and, dilute, are, your, positions, (13), and, as, for, perfection, or, completeness, in, divinity, it, is, not, to, be, sought, which, makes, this, course, of, artificial, divinity, the, more, suspect, for, he, that, will, reduce, a, knowledge, into, an, art, will, make, it, round, and, uniform, but, in, divinity, many, things, must, be, left, abrupt, and, concluded, with, this, altitudo, sapientiæ, et, scientiæ, dei_, _quam, incomprehensibilia, sunt, juducua, ejus_, _et, non, investigabiles, viæ, ejus_, so, again, the, apostle, saith, _ex, parte, scimus_, and, to, have, the, form, of, a, total, where, there, is, but, matter, for, a, part, cannot, be, without, supplies, by, supposition, and, presumption, and, therefore, conclude, that, the, true, use, of, these, sums, and, methods, hath, place, in, institutions, or, introductions, preparatory, unto, knowledge, but, in, them, or, by, deducement, from, them, to, handle, the, main, body, and, substance, of, a, knowledge, is, in, all, sciences, prejudicial, and, in, divinity, dangerous, (14), as, to, the, interpretation, of, the, scriptures, solute, and, at, large, there, have, been, divers, kinds, introduced, and, devised, some, of, them, rather, curious, and, unsafe, than, sober, and, warranted, notwithstanding, thus, much, must, be, confessed, that, the, scriptures, being, given, by, inspiration, and, not, by, human, reason, do, differ, from, all, other, books, in, the, author, which, by, consequence, doth, draw, on, some, difference, to, be, used, by, the, expositor, for, the, inditer, of, them, did, know, four, things, which, no, man, attains, to, know, which, are—the, mysteries, of, the, kingdom, of, glory, the, perfection, of, the, laws, of, nature, the, secrets, of, the, heart, of, man, and, the, future, succession, of, all, ages, for, as, to, the, first, it, is, said, “he, that, presseth, into, the, light, shall, be, oppressed, of, the, glory, ”, and, again, “no, man, shall, see, my, face, and, live, ”, to, the, second, “when, he, prepared, the, heavens, was, present, when, by, law, and, compass, he, enclosed, the, deep, ”, to, the, third, “neither, was, it, needful, that, any, should, bear, witness, to, him, of, man, for, he, knew, well, what, was, in, man, ”, and, to, the, last, “from, the, beginning, are, known, to, the, lord, all, his, works, ”, (15), from, the, former, two, of, these, have, been, drawn, certain, senses, and, expositions, of, scriptures, which, had, need, be, contained, within, the, bounds, of, sobriety—the, one, anagogical, and, the, other, philosophical, but, as, to, the, former, man, is, not, to, prevent, his, time, _videmus, nunc, per, speculum, in, ænigmate_, _tunc, autem, facie, ad, faciem_, wherein, nevertheless, there, seemeth, to, be, a, liberty, granted, as, far, forth, as, the, polishing, of, this, glass, or, some, moderate, explication, of, this, enigma, but, to, press, too, far, into, it, cannot, but, cause, a, dissolution, and, overthrow, of, the, spirit, of, man, for, in, the, body, there, are, three, degrees, of, that, we, receive, into, it—aliment, medicine, and, poison, whereof, aliment, is, that, which, the, nature, of, man, can, perfectly, alter, and, overcome, medicine, is, that, which, is, partly, converted, by, nature, and, partly, converteth, nature, and, poison, is, that, which, worketh, wholly, upon, nature, without, that, nature, can, in, any, part, work, upon, it, so, in, the, mind, whatsoever, knowledge, reason, cannot, at, all, work, upon, and, convert, is, a, mere, intoxication, and, endangereth, a, dissolution, of, the, mind, and, understanding, (16), but, for, the, latter, it, hath, been, extremely, set, on, foot, of, late, time, by, the, school, of, paracelsus, and, some, others, that, have, pretended, to, find, the, truth, of, all, natural, philosophy, in, the, scriptures, scandalising, and, traducing, all, other, philosophy, as, heathenish, and, profane, but, there, is, no, such, enmity, between, god’s, word, and, his, works, neither, do, they, give, honour, to, the, scriptures, as, they, suppose, but, much, embase, them, for, to, seek, heaven, and, earth, in, the, word, of, god, whereof, it, is, said, “heaven, and, earth, shall, pass, but, my, word, shall, not, pass, ”, is, to, seek, temporary, things, amongst, eternal, and, as, to, seek, divinity, in, philosophy, is, to, seek, the, living, amongst, the, dead, so, to, seek, philosophy, in, divinity, is, to, seek, the, dead, amongst, the, living, neither, are, the, pots, or, lavers, whose, place, was, in, the, outward, part, of, the, temple, to, be, sought, in, the, holiest, place, of, all, where, the, ark, of, the, testimony, was, seated, and, again, the, scope, or, purpose, of, the, spirit, of, god, is, not, to, express, matters, of, nature, in, the, scriptures, otherwise, than, in, passage, and, for, application, to, man’s, capacity, and, to, matters, moral, or, divine, and, it, is, a, true, rule, _auctoris, aliud, agentis, parva, auctoritas_, for, it, were, a, strange, conclusion, if, a, man, should, use, a, similitude, for, ornament, or, illustration, sake, borrowed, from, nature, or, history, according, to, vulgar, conceit, as, of, a, basilisk, a, unicorn, a, centaur, a, briareus, a, hydra, or, the, like, that, therefore, he, must, needs, be, thought, to, affirm, the, matter, thereof, positively, to, be, true, to, conclude, therefore, these, two, interpretations, the, one, by, reduction, or, enigmatical, the, other, philosophical, or, physical, which, have, been, received, and, pursued, in, imitation, of, the, rabbins, and, cabalists, are, to, be, confined, with, a, _a, noli, akryn, sapere_, _sed, time_, (17), but, the, two, latter, points, known, to, god, and, unknown, to, man, touching, the, secrets, of, the, heart, and, the, successions, of, time, doth, make, a, just, and, sound, difference, between, the, manner, of, the, exposition, of, the, scriptures, and, all, other, books, for, it, is, an, excellent, observation, which, hath, been, made, upon, the, answers, of, our, saviour, christ, to, many, of, the, questions, which, were, propounded, to, him, how, that, they, are, impertinent, to, the, state, of, the, question, demanded, the, reason, whereof, is, because, not, being, like, man, which, knows, man’s, thoughts, by, his, words, but, knowing, man’s, thoughts, immediately, he, never, answered, their, words, but, their, thoughts, much, in, the, like, manner, it, is, with, the, scriptures, which, being, written, to, the, thoughts, of, men, and, to, the, succession, of, all, ages, with, a, foresight, of, all, heresies, contradictions, differing, estates, of, the, church, yea, and, particularly, of, the, elect, are, not, to, be, interpreted, only, according, to, the, latitude, of, the, proper, sense, of, the, place, and, respectively, towards, that, present, occasion, whereupon, the, words, were, uttered, or, in, precise, congruity, or, contexture, with, the, words, before, or, after, or, in, contemplation, of, the, principal, scope, of, the, place, but, have, in, themselves, not, only, totally, or, collectively, but, distributively, in, clauses, and, words, infinite, springs, and, streams, of, doctrine, to, water, the, church, in, every, part, and, therefore, as, the, literal, sense, is, as, it, were, the, main, stream, or, river, so, the, moral, sense, chiefly, and, sometimes, the, allegorical, or, typical, are, they, whereof, the, church, hath, most, use, not, that, wish, men, to, be, bold, in, allegories, or, indulgent, or, light, in, allusions, but, that, do, much, condemn, that, interpretation, of, the, scripture, which, is, only, after, the, manner, as, men, use, to, interpret, a, profane, book, (18), in, this, part, touching, the, exposition, of, the, scriptures, can, report, no, deficiency, but, by, way, of, remembrance, this, will, add, in, perusing, books, of, divinity, find, many, books, of, controversies, and, many, of, commonplaces, and, treatises, a, mass, of, positive, divinity, as, it, is, made, an, art, a, number, of, sermons, and, lectures, and, many, prolix, commentaries, upon, the, scriptures, with, harmonies, and, concordances, but, that, form, of, writing, in, divinity, which, in, my, judgment, is, of, all, others, most, rich, and, precious, is, positive, divinity, collected, upon, particular, texts, of, scriptures, in, brief, observations, not, dilated, into, commonplaces, not, chasing, after, controversies, not, reduced, into, method, of, art, a, thing, abounding, in, sermons, which, will, vanish, but, defective, in, books, which, will, remain, and, a, thing, wherein, this, age, excelleth, for, am, persuaded, and, may, speak, it, with, an, _absit, invidia, verbo_, and, nowise, in, derogation, of, antiquity, but, as, in, a, good, emulation, between, the, vine, and, the, olive, that, if, the, choice, and, best, of, those, observations, upon, texts, of, scriptures, which, have, been, made, dispersedly, in, sermons, within, this, your, majesty’s, island, of, brittany, by, the, space, of, these, forty, years, and, more, (leaving, out, the, largeness, of, exhortations, and, applications, thereupon), had, been, set, down, in, a, continuance, it, had, been, the, best, work, in, divinity, which, had, been, written, since, the, apostles’, times, (19), the, matter, informed, by, divinity, is, of, two, kinds, matter, of, belief, and, truth, of, opinion, and, matter, of, service, and, adoration, which, is, also, judged, and, directed, by, the, former—the, one, being, as, the, internal, soul, of, religion, and, the, other, as, the, external, body, thereof, and, therefore, the, heathen, religion, was, not, only, a, worship, of, idols, but, the, whole, religion, was, an, idol, in, itself, for, it, had, no, soul, that, is, no, certainty, of, belief, or, confession, as, a, man, may, well, think, considering, the, chief, doctors, of, their, church, were, the, poets, and, the, reason, was, because, the, heathen, gods, were, no, jealous, gods, but, were, glad, to, be, admitted, into, part, as, they, had, reason, neither, did, they, respect, the, pureness, of, heart, so, they, might, have, external, honour, and, rites, (20), but, out, of, these, two, do, result, and, issue, four, main, branches, of, divinity, faith, manners, liturgy, and, government, faith, containeth, the, doctrine, of, the, nature, of, god, of, the, attributes, of, god, and, of, the, works, of, god, the, nature, of, god, consisteth, of, three, persons, in, unity, of, godhead, the, attributes, of, god, are, either, common, to, the, deity, or, respective, to, the, persons, the, works, of, god, summary, are, two, that, of, the, creation, and, that, of, the, redemption, and, both, these, works, as, in, total, they, appertain, to, the, unity, of, the, godhead, so, in, their, parts, they, refer, to, the, three, persons, that, of, the, creation, in, the, mass, of, the, matter, to, the, father, in, the, disposition, of, the, form, to, the, son, and, in, the, continuance, and, conservation, of, the, being, to, the, holy, spirit, so, that, of, the, redemption, in, the, election, and, counsel, to, the, father, in, the, whole, act, and, consummation, to, the, son, and, in, the, application, to, the, holy, spirit, for, by, the, holy, ghost, was, christ, conceived, in, flesh, and, by, the, holy, ghost, are, the, elect, regenerate, in, spirit, this, work, likewise, we, consider, either, effectually, in, the, elect, or, privately, in, the, reprobate, or, according, to, appearance, in, the, visible, church, (21), for, manners, the, doctrine, thereof, is, contained, in, the, law, which, discloseth, sin, the, law, itself, is, divided, according, to, the, edition, thereof, into, the, law, of, nature, the, law, moral, and, the, law, positive, and, according, to, the, style, into, negative, and, affirmative, prohibitions, and, commandments, sin, in, the, matter, and, subject, thereof, is, divided, according, to, the, commandments, in, the, form, thereof, it, referreth, to, the, three, persons, in, deity, sins, of, infirmity, against, the, father, whose, more, special, attribute, is, power, sins, of, ignorance, against, the, son, whose, attribute, is, wisdom, and, sins, of, malice, against, the, holy, ghost, whose, attribute, is, grace, or, love, in, the, motions, of, it, it, either, moveth, to, the, right, hand, or, to, the, left, either, to, blind, devotion, or, to, profane, and, libertine, transgression, either, in, imposing, restraint, where, god, granteth, liberty, or, in, taking, liberty, where, god, imposeth, restraint, in, the, degrees, and, progress, of, it, it, divideth, itself, into, thought, word, or, act, and, in, this, part, commend, much, the, deducing, of, the, law, of, god, to, cases, of, conscience, for, that, take, indeed, to, be, a, breaking, and, not, exhibiting, whole, of, the, bread, of, life, but, that, which, quickeneth, both, these, doctrines, of, faith, and, manners, is, the, elevation, and, consent, of, the, heart, whereunto, appertain, books, of, exhortation, holy, meditation, christian, resolution, and, the, like, (22), for, the, liturgy, or, service, it, consisteth, of, the, reciprocal, acts, between, god, and, man, which, on, the, part, of, god, are, the, preaching, of, the, word, and, the, sacraments, which, are, seals, to, the, covenant, or, as, the, visible, word, and, on, the, part, of, man, invocation, of, the, name, of, god, and, under, the, law, sacrifices, which, were, as, visible, prayers, or, confessions, but, now, the, adoration, being, _in, spiritu, et, veritate_, there, remaineth, only, _vituli, labiorum_, although, the, use, of, holy, vows, of, thankfulness, and, retribution, may, be, accounted, also, as, sealed, petitions, (23), and, for, the, government, of, the, church, it, consisteth, of, the, patrimony, of, the, church, the, franchises, of, the, church, and, the, offices, and, jurisdictions, of, the, church, and, the, laws, of, the, church, directing, the, whole, all, which, have, two, considerations, the, one, in, themselves, the, other, how, they, stand, compatible, and, agreeable, to, the, civil, estate, (24), this, matter, of, divinity, is, handled, either, in, form, of, instruction, of, truth, or, in, form, of, confutation, of, falsehood, the, declinations, from, religion, besides, the, privative, which, is, atheism, and, the, branches, thereof, are, three—heresies, idolatry, and, witchcraft, heresies, when, we, serve, the, true, god, with, a, false, worship, idolatry, when, we, worship, false, gods, supposing, them, to, be, true, and, witchcraft, when, we, adore, false, gods, knowing, them, to, be, wicked, and, false, for, so, your, majesty, doth, excellently, well, observe, that, witchcraft, is, the, height, of, idolatry, and, yet, we, see, though, these, be, true, degrees, samuel, teacheth, us, that, they, are, all, of, a, nature, when, there, is, once, a, receding, from, the, word, of, god, for, so, he, saith, _quasi, peccatum, ariolandi, est, repugnare_, _et, quasi, scelus, idololatriæ, nolle, acquiescere_, (25), these, things, have, passed, over, so, briefly, because, can, report, no, deficiency, concerning, them, for, can, find, no, space, or, ground, that, lieth, vacant, and, unsown, in, the, matter, of, divinity, so, diligent, have, men, been, either, in, sowing, of, good, seed, or, in, sowing, of, tares, *, *, *, *, *, thus, have, made, as, it, were, a, small, globe, of, the, intellectual, world, as, truly, and, faithfully, as, could, discover, with, a, note, and, description, of, those, parts, which, seem, to, me, not, constantly, occupate, or, not, well, converted, by, the, labour, of, man, in, which, if, have, in, any, point, receded, from, that, which, is, commonly, received, it, hath, been, with, a, purpose, of, proceeding, in, _melius_, and, not, _in, aliud_, a, mind, of, amendment, and, proficiency, and, not, of, change, and, difference, for, could, not, be, true, and, constant, to, the, argument, handle, if, were, not, willing, to, go, beyond, others, but, yet, not, more, willing, than, to, have, others, go, beyond, me, again, which, may, the, better, appear, by, this, that, have, propounded, my, opinions, naked, and, unarmed, not, seeking, to, preoccupate, the, liberty, of, men’s, judgments, by, confutations, for, in, anything, which, is, well, set, down, am, in, good, hope, that, if, the, first, reading, move, an, objection, the, second, reading, will, make, an, answer, and, in, those, things, wherein, have, erred, am, sure, have, not, prejudiced, the, right, by, litigious, arguments, which, certainly, have, this, contrary, effect, and, operation, that, they, add, authority, to, error, and, destroy, the, authority, of, that, which, is, well, invented, for, question, is, an, honour, and, preferment, to, falsehood, as, on, the, other, side, it, is, a, repulse, to, truth, but, the, errors, claim, and, challenge, to, myself, as, mine, own, the, good, it, any, be, is, due, _tanquam, adeps, sacrificii_, to, be, incensed, to, the, honour, first,
